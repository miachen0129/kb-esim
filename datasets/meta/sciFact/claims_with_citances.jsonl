The regulation of phagocytosis and its outcomes by inflammatory pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) is now followed by new studies strengthening this concept and adding further complexity to the relationship between phagocytosis and innate immune signaling. Phagocytosis forms the platform for activation of distinct members of the Toll-like receptor family, and even dictates their signaling outcomes. In many cases, phagocytosis is a necessary precedent to the activation of cytosolic PRRs and assembly of canonical and non-canonical inflammasomes, leading to strong pro-inflammatory responses and inflammatory cell death.", "citation_paragraph": "\u2022 Phagocytosis leads to degradation of internalized microbes\u2022 Phagocytosis is induced by PRRs, some of which engage immune signaling cascades\u2022 Phagocytosis activates endosomal TLRs and subsequent specific signaling pathways\u2022 Phagosomal release of microbial nucleic acids or proteins activates inflammasomes\u2022 PRR signaling and activated inflammasomes modulate phagosome maturation Phagocytosis is an actin-driven, receptor mediated process initiated upon recognition of microorganisms by Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs) expressed at the plasma membrane of phagocytes. Microorganisms can also be opsonized by immunoglobulins, serum amyloid P component or complement proteins, which engage specific PRRs and trigger opsonic phagocytosis. Some receptors like scavenger receptors and mannose receptor serve as phagocytic PRRs, while others like Dectin-1 and Fc\u03b3R serve dual roles transmitting inflammatory signals receptor that activate NF-\u03baB and/or NFAT transcription factors, and triggering actin polymerization via Rac2, Cdc42, and RhoG [75] . Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are signaling PRRs engaged by microbial components during phagocytosis leading to the activation of NF-\u03baB, MAPK and other transcription factors. TLR signals also trigger an inducible rate of phagocytosis and phagosome maturation via MyD88-dependent activation of the MAPK p38. Signals from TLRs also induce assembly of the NADPH oxidase NOX2 and the vacuolar v-ATPase. Phagocytosed Streptococcus pneumoniae secrete the pore-forming toxin Pneumolysin in phagosomes inducing disruption of phagosomal membranes. Subsequent potassium efflux, or release of the lysosomal protease Cathepsin B into the cytosol can lead to activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. C. Activation of NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes by microbial nucleic acids. E. coli mRNA is a signature of microbial viability, which is detected upon or after phagocytosis of bacteria (potentially via a TLR or cytosolic RNA sensor), activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, and triggers IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 production and pyroptosis. Phagocytosis of F. tularensis phagocytosis leads to access of bacterial DNA to the cytosol where it activates the AIM2 inflammasome. D. Interaction between phagosome and NLRP3 inflammasome. The NLRP3 inflammasome can be activated upon phagocytosis of Staphylococcus aureus when its PGN lacks modifications rendering it sensitive to lysozyme degradation. Active caspase-1 has been demonstrated around Staphylococcus-containing phagosomes, where it inhibits the NADPH oxidase NOX2. As a consequence, phagosomes acidify and Staphylococcus degradation in phagosomes is enhanced. A. Activation of the non-canonical inflammasome after phagosomal lysis and leaking of bacterial components. Direct delivery of LPS into the cytosol either experimentally with cholera toxin B or via transfection, or physiologically upon infection with Gram-negative bacteria, enables its detection by an unidentified cytosolic LPS-sensor. This sensor detects specifically hexa-or penta-acylated LPS, and then activates the non-canonical inflammasome pathway and caspase-11 within a few hours following infection. Active caspase-11 then promotes pyroptosis, and could also participate in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome or regulate phagosome-lysosome fusion [76] . Note that a priming step is required to induce caspase-11 transcription. B. Activation of caspase-11 and its role in activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Upon phagocytosis of viable E. coli, microbial mRNA induces the assembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, while TRIF-dependent TLR4 signaling activates the transcription of IFN-\u03b2 genes. Secreted IFN-\u03b2 binds to the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR), which induces the transcription of caspase-11 gene. Pro-caspase-11 is then cleaved into active caspase-11 and synergizes with bacterial mRNA in NLRP3 inflammasome. Note that TRIF and IFNAR signaling are involved in late stage (12-16 hours post infection) caspase-11 activation via as yet unidentified steps.", "citance": "Active caspase-11 then promotes pyroptosis, and could also participate in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome or regulate phagosome-lysosome fusion [76] .", "claims": [{"text": " Active caspase-11 participate in regulating phagosome-lysosome fusion.", "subject": "caspase-11", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Active caspase-11 participates in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.", "subject": "caspase-11", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Active caspase-11 participates in the repression of the NLRP3 inflammasome.", "subject": "caspase-11", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Active caspase-11 protein promotes pyroptosis.", "subject": "caspase-11", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Active caspase-11 protein suppresss pyroptosis.", "subject": "caspase-11", "is_negation": true}]}

The interaction is strongly governed by physical and chemical properties of the materials and displayed with differentiated cellular behaviors, including cell self\u2010renewal, differentiation, reprogramming, dedifferentiation, or transdifferentiation as a result. A number of engineered biomaterials with micro\u2010 or nano\u2010structures have been developed to mimic structural components of cell niche and specific function of extra cellular matrix (ECM) over past two decades. In this review article, we briefly introduce the fabrication of biomaterials and their classification into zero\u2010dimensional (0D), one\u2010dimensional (1D), two\u2010dimensional (2D) and three\u2010dimensional (3D) ones. More importantly, the influence of different biomaterials on inducing cell self\u2010renewal, differentiation, reprogramming, dedifferentiation, and transdifferentiation was discussed based on the progress at 0D, 1D, 2D and 3D levels, following which the current research limitations and research perspectives were provided.", "citation_paragraph": "Biological cues, especially growth factors, tend to be digested in body fluid by cellular enzymes [49] . Biodegradable and biocompatible 0DBMs seem to be promising candidates to solve the problem, since they show great abilities to deliver the biomolecules in to cells [99] , and some 0DBMs even show inductive properties themselves. The influences of 0DBMs on stem cell differentiation highly depend on the mechanisms of cellular uptake, which are categorized as caveolae-mediated endocytosis, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and caveolae-and clathrinindependent endocytosis [100, 101] , and representative examples of 0DBMs regulating MSCs differentiation are tabulated in Table 2 . Systematic studies concerning the modulation mechanism of metallic NPs on the differentiation of stem cells have been performed by many researchers. The intracellular mechanical stress, caused by introducing metallic NPs, may play an important role in determining the differentiation of MSCs. For example, Yi et al. found that Au-NPs, grouped in intracellular compartments of MSCs, might interact with proteins located in the cytoplasm and cause mechanical stress on MSCs [81] . The expression of protein kinase 38 (p38), which is usually referred to as one of the stress-activated protein kinases, was significantly up-regulated in MSCs upon interaction with Au-NPs, leading to significant enhancement of osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. However, the expression of adipogenic specific genes and proteins was significantly attenuated in MSCs upon Au-NPs treatment, which might result from the intracellular mechanical stress as well. Fig. 5 shows a schematic model describing the molecular mechanism of the modulation of osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of MSCs by Au-NPs through p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Similar effects on MSCs were also observed in other metallic NPs. The Ag-NPs encapsulated in collagen promoted osteogenic differentiation in vitro and also promoted the formation of fracture callus in vivo [60] . Besides mechanical stress, surface modification on metallic NPs also influenced the differentiation of MSCs. Li et al. modified the surface of Au-NPs with various functional groups, i.e., amine (-NH 2 ), carboxyl (-COOH), hydroxyl (-OH), and found that these modified Au-NPs showed different influence on osteogenic differentiation of MSCs [102] . The Au-COOH-NPs treated MSCs exhibited significantly changed alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and calcium deposition, which was attributed to the up-regulation of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) and FGF-2 expression. In contrast, Au-OHNPs increased ALP activity. In addition, the surface modified metallic NPs also showed the potential to regulate the differentiation of MSCs into cardiocytes [107] and neuronal cells [108] .Inorganic and metallic nonmetallic 0DBMs, such as HAp-NPs, Si-NPs and TiO 2 -NPs, are considered as promising biomaterials for bone regeneration since these inorganic molecules potently bind to human bones via direct bonds [109] . HAp-NPs have attracted increasing scientific attention since HAp shares a similar composition to bone matrix components [110] . Gao et al. found that HAp-NPs in polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogel significantly enhanced the differentiation of MSCs into osteogenic lineage [111] . Besides, HAp/PLGA-NPs led to promoted osteogenic differentiation of MSCs [62, 104] . Si-NPs have been widely studied for biomedical applications [112] . In 2010, Liu et al. reported for the first time the application of Si-NPs in modulating MSCs differentiation [80] , and found that pure Si-NPs did not exhibit observable effect on both adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation, while the insulinconjugated Si-NPs significantly promoted adipogenic differentiation. Recently, Wang et al. reported that IO-NPs could promote osteogenic differentiation of MSCs in vitro, resulting from the up-regulating of p38 MAPK signaling pathway [103] . The effects of TiO 2 -NPs on stem cell differentiation are investigated by Hou et al. [63] , and it was found that with increasing size of TiO 2 -NPs, the gene expression of osteocalcin (OCN) and osteopontin (OPN) were significantly down-regulated, leading to suppressed osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Quantum dots (QDs) are another class of inorganic nonmetallic 0DBMs, which have been used for the long-term labeling and modulating of stem cells [99] . Some studies have reported that the MSCs labeled with CdSe/ZnS QDs showed significantly inhibited expression of type II collagen and aggrecan (levels of mRNA and protein) in the chondrospheres, indicating that the presence of QDs may interfere with the chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs [61] .Besides inorganic and metallic nonmetallic 0DBMs, other NPs were also applied for modulating the differentiation of stem cells. A recent work showed that chitosan/tripolyphosphate/hyaluronic acid (CTH)-NPs successfully delivered the anti-miRNA-138 and significantly enhanced the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs [113] . Zheng et al. reported that both ruthenium functional selenium (Ru@Se) NPs and citric acid selenium (Cit@Se) NPs could activate Smad-dependent BMP signaling pathway and induce the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs over adipogenic differentiation [75] . Similar results were observed when introducing endohedral metallofullerenol ([Gd@C 82 (OH) 22 ] n ) into MSCs in vitro and in vivo [106] .Based on their large surface area and small size, 0DBMs can enter cells via endocytosis and enhance various molecular changes, therefore, they have played a significant role in directing the differentiation of stem cells (refer to Table 2 ). In some cases, the modulation of MSCs differentiation depended on the interaction between unmodified 0DBMs with cell nucleus, cytoplasm and organelle via influencing specific cellular signaling pathways. In some other cases, the 0DBMs were used as biomolecule carriers, and the differentiation of MSCs was mainly attributed to the loaded biomolecules.", "citance": "Biodegradable and biocompatible 0DBMs seem to be promising candidates to solve the problem, since they show great abilities to deliver the biomolecules in to cells [99] , and some 0DBMs even show inductive properties themselves.", "claims": [{"text": "0-dimensional biomaterials lack inductive properties.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "0-dimensional biomaterials show inductive properties.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

MATERIALS AND METHODS All vCJD cases of appropriate age and any sporadic CJD (sCJD) or familial CJD (fCJD) cases with a history of blood donation or transfusion are notified to the UKBS. Donation records are sought and the usage of all donations is determined by look back. Death certificates are obtained for all donors to patients with CJD and recipients of transfused components from patients with CJD who are deceased.   RESULTS The study identified 29 sCJD blood donors, of 370 reported, with transfusion to 211 recipients. Five of these recipients were reported to have died with or of dementia, but were not believed to be cases of CJD. The vCJD arm found 18 vCJD blood donors who had donated blood which was issued for clinical usage, of 24 traced donors from 177 UK vCJD cases. To date, 3 cases of vCJD have occurred in 67 recipients identified in this recipient group, and one recipient had post-mortem confirmation of abnormal prion protein deposition in the spleen (all previously reported).   CONCLUSION The results of the ongoing TMER study show no new cases of transfusion-associated vCJD since 2007 and no evidence of transfusion transmission of sCJD.", "citation_paragraph": "This study has not identified any new cases of transmission of vCJD by blood transfusion, with only 4 documented infections to date, as described in an earlier TMER publication in 2006 [2] . The possibility that there are significant numbers of missed transfusion cases is judged to be unlikely, not least because the great majority of vCJD cases have no history of blood transfusion [2, 10] . It is surprising that there have been no further transfusion transmitted cases in view of the estimated prevalence of abnormal PrP positivity of 1/2000 in the general UK population, derived from an anonymised survey of routine appendix tissue [11] . All clinical cases of vCJD with data on genotype have been methionine homozygotes at codon 129 of the PRNP gene. Analysis of the codon 129 distribution in the UK population indicates that 44% are MM homozygotes, with 45% MV heterozygotes and 11% VV (valine homozygotes) [12] . It is possible that individuals who are either heterozygotes or valine homozygotes may experience a longer pre-symptomatic phase before developing clinically evident vCJD and all codon 129 genotypes were represented in the positive appendix samples in the recent prevalence study. However, it is 20 years since the onset of symptoms in the first case of vCJD and no definite or probable case of vCJD One of the MV heterozygote recipients had a tonsil biopsy which showed no evidence of abnormal PrP deposition. This recipient received a transfusion from an individual from whom an earlier donation was implicated in two of the three known transfusion-transmitted cases, who were, as previously stated, MM homozygotes. It is of interest that in 3 surviving asymptomatic MM homozygotes, red cells had been leucodepleted, a policy introduced in the UK as a v-CJD risk-reduction measure in 1999. In addition, the fourth surviving asymptomatic MM homozygote had received cryo-depleted plasma.The high proportion (50.7%) of blood transfusion recipients who died within 5 years of transfusion reflects the comorbidities which led to blood transfusion. Extrapolating from other acquired prion diseases, kuru and iatrogenic CJD, the minimum incubation periods are at least 4.5 years [13, 14] , and it is unlikely that this group would have manifest symptoms of vCJD prior to death, even if infected. The observed interval from transfusion to symptom onset in the identified transfusion cases was 6 \u00bd to 8 years, 4 months. It is also likely that there may be variable levels of infectivity in blood from vCJD donors relating to the proximity of the time of the donation to symptom onset in that individual and early donations might have a lower level of infectivity, which could be associated with a longer pre-symptomatic phase in recipients.Recipients of any blood transfusion are now deferred from themselves donating blood, which prevents the potential propagation of a transfusion vCJD epidemic, which is important if some donors have a subclinical infection. It is of note that laboratory transmission studies using splenic tissue from the sub-clinically infected vCJD case have confirmed the presence of infectivity and this case was a codon 129 heterozygote [15] .In contrast to the vCJD group, as yet there have been no cases of sCJD with definite epidemiological evidence to support a transfusion link. Evidence of an increased risk through blood transfusion in sCJD with a lag period of more than 10 years in an Italian study [4] was not replicated by a similar analysis of UK data [5] . In our study of sCJD there has been a total of 1194 patient-years survival following transfusion from a sCJD donor with no evidence of transmission via blood transfusion. The absence of any observed cases supports the hypothesis that blood infectivity, should it be present at all, is lower in sCJD than vCJD. This would be compatible with the extensive PrP Sc deposition in lymphoreticular tissues in vCJD, which contrasts with sCJD where there is comparatively much less 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60 F o r P e e r R e v i e w 9 peripheral PrP Sc . Nevertheless, animal studies using transgenic mice overexpressing human PrP C have suggested there can be infectivity in sCJD blood [16] and work is ongoing to attempt to use amplification techniques, such as real-time quaking induced conversion (RTQuIC), to identify a positive signal in blood in sCJD. The identification of positive findings in sCJD blood using highly sensitive techniques may be difficult to interpret in relation to actual risk and epidemiological data remains important in assessing risks for public health.", "citance": "It is surprising that there have been no further transfusion transmitted cases in view of the estimated prevalence of abnormal PrP positivity of 1/2000 in the general UK population, derived from an anonymised survey of routine appendix tissue [11] .", "claims": [{"text": "1 in 5 million in UK have abnormal PrP positivity.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "1/2000 in UK have abnormal PrP positivity.

{"s2orc_id": 84454816, "title": "Recent Findings on the Genetics of Obesity: Is there Public Health Relevance?", "abstract": "Since initial studies investigating familial forms of obesity, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been tremendously successful at detecting replicable associations between common genetic variation and measures of fat mass and obesity. The contributory variants found by this approach are limited, as one might expect, in terms of effect size and appear to offer little in terms of direct clinical applicability. However, can these variants with established associations be of value? This review will revisit how common genetic variation reliably associated with measures of fat mass and obesity can inform etiological understanding, improve knowledge of genetic architecture, and enable applied epidemiological analyses. With the discovery of additional body mass index-associated loci and the further functional characterization of identified variants, attempts can be made to better understand and causally analyze the genetic, biological, and environmental pathways to effect involved in obesity and its related comorbidities.", "citation_paragraph": "Direct genotyping in GWAS and viable imputation using original HapMap reference panels only covers a limited number of SNPs and range of allele frequencies. The development of denser genotyping chips and imputation methods using data from the HapMap 3 [91] and 1,000 genomes project [92] will enable extension to a larger set of variants and will allow for targeted resequencing and systematic fine mapping to produce a complete portfolio of sequence variation. Such sequence variation is likely to consist of rare variants, present in less than 1 % of the population (the threshold for polymorphism in traditional GWAS), with potentially larger penetrance effects than previously identified common variants [93] . More than 100 different mutations have now been identified within the MC4R region and, although many of these variants are very rare, together they account for a higher proportion of total variation in adiposity [94] .It also has been proposed that particular structural variants in the genome might play a role in the predisposition to obesity. One kilobase repeats known as copy number variants (CNVs) are assumed to be involved in the regulation of neighboring genes [95] . For example, a CNV located in a region near to the neuronal growth regulator 1 (NEGR1) gene may be involved in regulation of this gene [40\u2022]. In addition, the role of noncoding RNAs, including microRNAs that regulate posttranscriptional gene expression, is being increasingly researched in this field [96] .Gene-Gene and Gene-Environment interactions Genetic analyses often are based assuming simple additive models, when in reality, alternative modes of contribution and gene-gene interactions are likely to be common in complex traits, which have a vast number of pathways to effect [97] . To date, very few genuine gene-gene interactions have been ascertained due to the computational and power-intensive requirements of such studies and the requirement for a priori knowledge of the specific genes involved [98] . Nonetheless, a potential benefit of identifying interacting loci is that it might aid in our understanding of the biological role of genetic variants, and their relative positions in the pathways to disease, and so value must be placed on this ongoing search.It also is important to gain a better picture of both genetic and environmental pathways to effect in the field of obesity and to understand the interplay between environmental contributions and genetic predispositions. It is likely that the effects of different obesity loci are dependent on the environment in which they are expressed. Differences in the environment and heterogeneity in lifestyle offers a potential explanation for why different variants may be identified in GWAS of individuals from different regions and at differing points in the lifecourse. Therefore, as well as potential for gene-gene interactions in explaining some of the missing heritability, it also is necessary to consider geneenvironment interactions to obtain a full understanding of the genetic architecture of obesity [99] . For example, it has been proposed that the effects of a high-fat diet may interact with risk alleles, including FTO, to accentuate the influence of these variants on BMI [100] . In addition, interactions also have been proposed between risk genotypes and physical activity levels [101, 102] . With the benefit of large sample sizes, a meta-analysis has recently provided evidence that a high physical activity level attenuates the effect of a risk FTO allele [102] .", "citance": "Such sequence variation is likely to consist of rare variants, present in less than 1 % of the population (the threshold for polymorphism in traditional GWAS), with potentially larger penetrance effects than previously identified common variants [93] .", "claims": [{"text": "1,000 genomes project enables mapping of genetic sequence variation consisting of rare variants with larger penetrance effects than common variants.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

C6 and RH7777 Morris hepatoma cells were transduced with a triple reporter gene (HSV1-tk/green fluorescent protein/firefly luciferase-triple fusion), placed under the control of a HIF-1-inducible hypoxia responsive element (HRE). The cells showed inducible luciferase activity and green fluorescent protein expression in vitro. Isolated reporter-transduced Morris hepatoma cells were used to produce tumors in livers of nude rats, and the effect of hepatic artery clamping was evaluated. Tumor hypoxia was shown by immunofluorescence microscopy with the hypoxia marker EF5 [2-(2-nitro-1H-imidazol-1-yl)-N-(2,2,3,3,3-pentafluoropropyl acetamide)] and the fluorescent perfusion marker Hoechst 33342, and by pO(2) electrode measurements. For tumor hypoxia imaging with the HRE-responsive reporter, both luciferase bioluminescence and [(18)F]2'-fluoro-2'-deoxyarabinofuranosyl-5-ethyluracil positron emission tomography was done, and the presence of hypoxia in Morris hepatoma tumors were successfully imaged by both techniques. Transient clamping of the hepatic artery caused cessation of tumor perfusion and severe hypoxia in liver tumors, but not in adjacent liver tissue. These results show that the orthotopic reporter-transduced RH7777 Morris hepatomas are natively hypoxic and poorly perfused in this animal model, and that the magnitude of hypoxia can be monitored using a HRE-responsive reporter system for both bioluminescence and positron emission tomography imaging. However, the severity of tumor ischemia after permanent ligation of the hepatic artery limits our ability to image severe hypoxia in this animal model.", "citation_paragraph": "Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in both men and women in the United States. Over 150,000 new cases of colorectal cancer are expected to be diagnosed in the United States in 2007 with similar accounts in Europe. Whereas surgical resection may be curative for patients diagnosed with early-stage disease, 61% of the patients are diagnosed with regional or distant metastases (1) . Colorectal cancer most commonly metastasizes to the liver. Hepatic metastasis determines the prognosis of patients with colorectal carcinoma. Surgical resection can result in significant prolongation of survival of patients with isolated hepatic metastases. The 5-year survival rate of patients who underwent complete resection of hepatic metastases is f35% (2) . Unfortunately, <10% of the patients are candidates for surgical resection of their liver lesions and require other regional or systemic treatments (3) .An increasing interest in the tumor microenvironment, particularly neovascularization and hypoxia, has developed in the last decade. Hypoxia has been shown to be a common feature of a wide range of solid tumors (4 -8) . Tumor hypoxia has been shown to be an adverse prognostic factor in various cancers, because of the associated increase in potential for tumor progression, metastasis, and resistance to treatment (7, 9) . Rather than designing therapeutic strategies to overcome hypoxic resistance, a number of groups have chosen to exploit the hypoxic nature of tumors to gain a therapeutic advantage. Although prolonged hypoxia can induce tumor necrosis, hepatic artery ligation alone does not seem to be useful for colorectal cancer liver metastases (10) . Recent studies suggest that hypoxia can be used to target and improve cancer therapy (11, 12) . One objective of targeted gene therapy is to minimize gene expression in normal tissue and to maximize gene expression in tumor tissue. In principle, this could be achieved by regulating therapeutic gene expression by tumor-specific promotors. Although hypoxia response elements (HRE) are not tumor specific, especially when one considers the ''ischemia'' of many organs in the older population with cancer, the severe hypoxia associated with many solid tumors and metastases could be exploited for therapeutic advantage. van Laarhoven et al. (13) recently showed high levels of hypoxia in patients with colorectal liver metastases, based on the postsurgical analysis of tumor specimens stained for the hypoxic cell marker pimonidazole.With the advent of hypoxia-targeted therapies in combination with hepatic artery ligation (14) , the need for noninvasive hypoxia monitoring and therapeutic efficacy will become necessary. Imaging is increasingly being used for noninvasive assessment of tumor physiology and phenotype to enable appropriate patient selection as well as monitor the response of novel therapies. Currently, several noninvasive methods for monitoring tissue hypoxia are under investigation and several of them have the potential for translation to the clinic (15, 16) .The purpose of this study was to develop an orthotopic liver tumor model with a hypoxia-sensitive reporter system to monitor tumor hypoxia by noninvasive imaging. A regulated reporter system was developed, similar to the system that was previously validated (17) .

The \u2018triple risk model\u2019 describes SIDS as an event that results from the intersection of three overlapping factors: (1) a vulnerable infant, (2) a critical developmental period in homeostatic control and (3) an exogenous stressor. In an attempt to understand how the triple risk hypothesis is related to infant cardiorespiratory physiology, many researchers have examined how the known risk and protective factors for SIDS alter infant cardiovascular control during sleep. This review discusses the association between the three components of the triple risk hypothesis and major risk factors for SIDS, such as prone sleeping, maternal smoking, together with three \u201cprotective\u201d factors, and cardiovascular control during sleep in infants, and discusses their potential involvement in SIDS.", "citation_paragraph": "Approximately 90% of SIDS deaths occur in infants aged less than 6 months [2] . During this period, the central nervous system undergoes dramatic maturational changes which are reflected in extensive alterations to sleep architecture, electroencephalogram characteristics and autonomic control. The 2-4-month period, in particular, has been described as a \"developmental window of vulnerability\", and coincides with the age where a distinct peak in SIDS incidence occurs [2] .A number of other significant developmental factors may make an infant more vulnerable to a cardiorespiratory challenge during this critical developmental period. Studies in both preterm [44, 49] and term [11] infants have identified a nadir in basal blood pressure during sleep at 2-4 months of age, when compared to both earlier (2-4 weeks) and later (5-6 months) ages studied; a nadir in physiological anaemia also occurs at this age. Blood pressure responses to a cardiovascular challenge (head-up tilting) are also impaired at 2-4 months compared to younger (2-4 weeks) and older (5-6 months) ages [51] . The maturational reduction in cerebral oxygenation is most marked between 2-4 weeks and 2-4 months of age, which may be due to limited or inadequate flow-metabolism coupling at this age [52] . Thus, the 2-4-month age could represent a critical time period when effects of low blood pressure could accentuate decrements in oxygen carrying capacity and delivery to critical organs [11] .

{"s2orc_id": 16844528, "title": "Maintenance on a ketogenic diet: voluntary exercise, adiposity, and neuroendocrine effects", "abstract": "BACKGROUND Adherence to low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diets (KDs) has been associated with greater weight loss in the short-term than low-fat, calorie-restricted diets. However, consumption of KDs may result in decreased voluntary exercise and thus render long-term weight loss and maintenance of weight loss difficult.   METHODS Rats were maintained on either a non-ketogenic chow (CH) diet or a low-carbohydrate, KD for 6 weeks. Half of each dietary group was sedentary, whereas the other half was given access to a running wheel. Running wheel activity (total distance and meters per minute), plasma leptin and insulin, adiposity, and hypothalamic mRNA for neuropeptide Y and proopiomelanocortin (POMC) were measured to assess activity-related effects in animals maintained on KD.   RESULTS With access to a running wheel, rats on KD engaged in similar levels of voluntary activity as CH rats and both dietary groups decreased caloric intake. Caloric intake increased over time such that it was significantly greater than sedentary controls after 1 month of access to the wheels, however body weight remained decreased. Sedentary rats maintained on KD had increased adiposity and plasma leptin levels and decreased hypothalamic POMC mRNA, as compared to sedentary CH rats. KD rats with access to a running wheel had similar levels of adiposity and plasma leptin levels as CH rats with access to running wheels, but significantly increased POMC mRNA in the arcuate.   CONCLUSION We demonstrate that maintenance on KD does not inhibit voluntary activity in a running wheel. Furthermore, prevention of KD-related increased adiposity and plasma leptin, as measured in sedentary KD rats, significantly increases levels of the anorexigenic neuropeptide POMC mRNA.", "citation_paragraph": "The prevalence of overweight and obesity among adults in the United States has increased significantly over the past four decades (1) . Numerous diets have been proposed to induce weight loss, and it is estimated that between 30 and 45% of adults in the United States use specific dietary approaches in an attempt to lose weight (2) . Although low fat, reducedcalorie diets coupled with increased energy expenditure are generally recommended for weight loss, the use of low-carbohydrate diets has increased in recent years (3) . Proponents of low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diets promote the concept that caloric intake and dietary fat are not the culprits in obesity, and that ultimately minimization of carbohydrate intake leads to weight loss, decreased hunger, and maintenance of reduced body weight (4, 5) . Low carbohydrate diets have, in fact, been associated with greater weight loss in the short-term as compared to weight loss associated with low fat diet users (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . However, long-term evaluations found no significant differences in weight loss between low-carbohydrate dieters and controls at one year (11, 12) .While many individuals engage in dieting strategies in an attempt to lose weight, increased physical activity is an important component of the weight-loss equation. Studies comparing weight loss with diet alone as compared to those that included increased physical activity demonstrate increased weight-loss maintenance in individuals who regularly exercised (13, 14) . Individuals consuming carbohydrate-restricted diets report fatigue and reduced vigor in response to exercise significantly more than individuals consuming high-carbohydrate diets (11, 15) . Furthermore, maintenance on a ketogenic diet results in reduced free-living physical activity, a response that can be counter-productive in individuals trying to lose weight (16) . Fatigue and perceived effort during exercise have been compared in trained, overweight adults adhering to a low-carbohydrate diet that was ketogenic or to a control diet that was also low in carbohydrate but non-ketogenic (5% vs. 40% carbohydrate). While weight loss was similar among diet groups, there was a positive correlation between feelings of fatigue while exercising and blood ketone concentrations. These data suggest that ketogenic diets enhance fatigability and can reduce the desire to exercise (16) . Given reported differences in levels of physical activity by individuals consuming low carbohydrate diets (16) , the increased fat content of low carbohydrate diets (8, 17) and the known effects of consuming a high fat diet on adiposity (18-23), we hypothesized that rats maintained on a ketogenic diet would engage in less voluntary activity when given access to a running wheel than chow-fed rats. We evaluated running wheel activity, caloric intake and body weight in rats given access to a running wheel for four consecutive weeks, as well as adiposity and plasma insulin and leptin. We have previously reported that maintenance on a ketogenic diet affects neuropeptide Y (NPY) and proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (24), therefore we included measures of these parameters after exposure to running wheels.(25\u00b0C) on a 12:12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 4:00 AM). The tub cages were attached to running wheels, (Lafayette Instruments, Lafayette, IN) however access to wheels was blocked and the wheels were in a locked position unless otherwise noted. All rats had 24 h access to food and tap water during all portions of the experiment, except for 1 h each day during which time food was weighed and replaced.

They include sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD), the most common form, and variant CJD (vCJD), which is caused by interspecies transmission of prions from cattle infected by bovine spongiform encephalopathy. Development of a biochemical assay for the sensitive, specific, early, and noninvasive detection of prions (PrPSc) in the blood of patients affected by prion disease is a top medical priority to increase the safety of the blood supply. vCJD has already been transmitted from human to human by blood transfusion, and the number of asymptomatic carriers of vCJD in the U.K. alone is estimated to be 1 in 2000 people. We used the protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) technique to analyze blood samples from 14 cases of vCJD and 153 controls, including patients affected by sCJD and other neurodegenerative or neurological disorders as well as healthy subjects. Our results showed that PrPSc could be detected with 100% sensitivity and specificity in blood samples from vCJD patients. Detection was possible in any of the blood fractions analyzed and could be done with as little as a few microliters of sample volume. The PrPSc concentration in blood was estimated to be ~0.5 pg/ml. Our findings suggest that PMCA may be useful for premortem noninvasive diagnosis of vCJD and to identify prion contamination of the blood supply. Further studies are needed to fully validate the technology.", "citation_paragraph": "So far, 231 cases of vCJD have been reported mostly in the U.K. and France (with 4 cases in the United States) (26) , and the future of this epidemic remains unknown. Fortunately, the spread of classical BSE has been largely controlled, thanks to the implementation of feeding restrictions and surveillance (27) (28) (29) . However, the appearance of atypical and genetic forms of BSE is an additional concern because the characteristics of transmission of these new forms may be different from that of traditional BSE (30) (31) (32) (33) . Nevertheless, it is estimated that millions of people have been exposed to BSE prions, and it is currently unclear how many people may silently carry infectious material. Studies in transgenic mouse models of human prion disease showed that infection with BSE prions frequently produces subclinical or carrier states, which upon a secondary infection can produce full-blown disease (3, 34, 35) . Strikingly, a recent study searching for PrP Sc immunoreactivity in archived surgically resected appendix samples in the U.K. estimated that 30,000 people in this country are asymptomatic carriers of vCJD infection (36) . It is probable that this number is underestimated, because the methods used to detect prions in lymphoreticular specimens are unlikely to have 100% sensitivity. The possible existence of a large number of carriers of vCJD prions represents a significant risk for iatrogenic transmission of vCJD from human to human, a pathway that has already been shown to happen in other human prion diseases, such as kuru and iatrogenic CJD (37) . Iatrogenic transmission of vCJD through blood transfusion is a major concern. Unfortunately, this route has already proven to be a problem because several cases have been linked to transfusion of blood donated by infected individuals in the preclinical stage of the disease (38) (39) (40) .Currently, there is no premortem biochemical diagnosis for vCJD or any validated procedure to detect prions in blood or other human-derived tissues that might represent a concern for iatrogenic transmission of vCJD. People affected by vCJD die, on average, 2 years after the first clinical signs appear. The disease normally starts with psychiatric alterations (depression, anxiety, and hallucinations), which are common in other diseases, and only begins to show more typical signs of a neurodegenerative condition (ataxia, myoclonus, and dementia) several months after the first symptoms have occurred. Even then, the diagnosis of vCJD is uncertain and is only confirmed by postmortem examination of the brain for the presence of prions with the vCJD signature. A definitive diagnosis of vCJD in the early stages of clinical disease will be crucial for differential diagnosis from other neurological disorders that share similar clinical abnormalities. Furthermore, early diagnosis of vCJD would allow any potential therapy to be given before substantial brain damage has occurred. It would also allow any public health measures to be implemented rapidly, for example, tracing recipients of blood donated by individuals with vCJD.Sensitive detection of prions in biological fluids has been reported using prion amplification techniques, including PMCA and RT-QuIC (real-time quaking-induced conversion) (41, 42) . Both PMCA and RTQuIC take advantage of the seeding of protein misfolding by prions to substantially amplify the signal and detect small amounts of PrP Sc .", "citance": "Strikingly, a recent study searching for PrP Sc immunoreactivity in archived surgically resected appendix samples in the U.K. estimated that 30,000 people in this country are asymptomatic carriers of vCJD infection (36) .", "claims": [{"text": "30,000 people in the UK are asymptomatic carriers of vCJD infection.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "A total of 1,000 people in the UK are asymptomatic carriers of vCJD infection.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}
{"s2orc_id": 1191206, "title": "Hepatitis Infection in the Treatment of Opioid Dependence and Abuse", "abstract": "Many new and existing cases of viral hepatitis infections are related to injection drug use. Transmission of these infections can result directly from the use of injection equipment that is contaminated with blood containing the hepatitis B or C virus or through sexual contact with an infected individual. In the latter case, drug use can indirectly contribute to hepatitis transmission through the dis-inhibited at-risk behavior, that is, unprotected sex with an infected partner. Individuals who inject drugs are at-risk for infection from different hepatitis viruses, hepatitis A, B, or C. Those with chronic hepatitis B virus infection also face additional risk should they become co-infected with hepatitis D virus. Protection from the transmission of hepatitis viruses A and B is best achieved by vaccination. For those with a history of or who currently inject drugs, the medical management of viral hepatitis infection comprising screening, testing, counseling and providing care and treatment is evolving. Components of the medical management of hepatitis infection, for persons considering, initiating, or receiving pharmacologic therapy for opioid addiction include: testing for hepatitis B and C infections; education and counseling regarding at-risk behavior and hepatitis transmission, acute and chronic hepatitis infection, liver disease and its care and treatment; vaccination against hepatitis A and B infection; and integrative primary care as part of the comprehensive treatment approach for recovery from opioid abuse and dependence. In addition, participation in a peer support group as part of integrated medical care enhances treatment outcomes. Liver disease is highly prevalent in patient populations seeking recovery from opioid addiction or who are currently receiving pharmacotherapy for opioid addiction. Pharmacotherapy for opioid addiction is not a contraindication to evaluation, care, or treatment of liver disease due to hepatitis virus infection. Successful pharmacotherapy for opioid addiction stabilizes patients and improves patient compliance to care and treatment regimens as well as promotes good patient outcomes. Implementation and integration of effective hepatitis prevention programs, care programs, and treatment regimens in concert with the pharmacological therapy of opioid addiction can reduce the public health burdens of hepatitis and injection drug use.", "citation_paragraph": "Liver transplantation is standard treatment for individuals with end-stage liver disease. A substance abuse-related diagnosis, either HCV or alcoholic liver disease, is the leading cause (46 percent of cases) and next leading cause (25 percent of cases) for liver transplantation, respectively. The current use of addictive drugs is an absolute contraindication for acceptance into liver transplantation programs (Keeffe, 2000) . An abstinence period of at least 6 months is required and patients fully recovered from drug use can be considered for liver transplantation.A 2001 survey of liver transplantation programs found that 32 percent of programs required patients to discontinue methadone treatment (Koch and Banys, 2001) . Approximately 6 percent of all individuals with HCV infection are prescribed methadone. However, 85 percent of all methadone patients are HCV-infected. Studies do not support withholding the provision of liver transplantation from patients receiving methadone, although patients who undergo liver transplantation while receiving methadone do have substantial medical complications. One study described the outcomes of fi ve patients receiving methadone who had been abstinent from illicit drugs and alcohol for at least 6 months. Three patients had end-stage liver disease resulting from HCV infection, one from HBV infection and one from alcoholic liver disease. No patient returned to illicit drug use post-transplantation, and mean patient survival time, at publication, was 1,250 days (over 3 years). The study concluded that acceptable patient survival rates can be achieved in patients receiving methadone as long as patients receive counseling, psychotherapy, and services post-transplantation to enhance retention in care (Kanchana et al. 2002) . The largest reported series of patients provided outcomes for 35 patients receiving methadone. The study reported a higher than normal rate of rejection, but patient graft and survival times were comparable to national averages. Eleven percent of patients relapsed to isolated episodes of heroin use post-transplant (Liu et al. 2003) .In a more recent report, 10 patients receiving methadone were compared with 19 nonmethadone, nonopioid-dependent patients, post-transplantation. Patients receiving methadone required signifi cantly more intraoperative anesthesia and postoperative analgesia as well as methadone dose increases (preoperatively compared to postoperatively). Survival time was not different between groups. However, post-transplantation, 20 percent of patients used alcohol or illicit drugs. The authors conclude that liver transplantation patients receiving methadone pose a greater challenge to their medical management but should not be withheld from liver transplantation waiting lists (Weinrieb et al. 2004 ). Other case reports of patients receiving methadone treatment and a liver transplant show 5 years post-transplant that the patients are stable and continuing on methadone treatment (Hancock et al. 2007) .

{"s2orc_id": 3570185, "title": "4-Phenylbutyrate Attenuates the ER Stress Response and Cyclic AMP Accumulation in DYT1 Dystonia Cell Models", "abstract": "Dystonia is a neurological disorder in which sustained muscle contractions induce twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal posturing. DYT1 early-onset primary dystonia is the most common form of hereditary dystonia and is caused by deletion of a glutamic acid residue (302/303) near the carboxyl-terminus of encoded torsinA. TorsinA is localized primarily within the contiguous lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nuclear envelope (NE), and is hypothesized to function as a molecular chaperone and an important regulator of the ER stress-signaling pathway, but how the mutation in torsinA causes disease remains unclear. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the clinical symptoms of dystonia result from abnormalities in dopamine (DA) signaling, and possibly involving its down-stream effector adenylate cyclase that produces the second messenger cyclic adenosine-3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP). Here we find that mutation in torsinA induces ER stress, and inhibits the cyclic adenosine-3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP) response to the adenylate cyclase agonist forskolin. Both defective mechanins are corrected by the small molecule 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) that alleviates ER stress. Our results link torsinA, the ER-stress-response, and cAMP-dependent signaling, and suggest 4-PBA could also be used in dystonia treatment. Other pharmacological agents known to modulate the cAMP cascade, and ER stress may also be therapeutic in dystonia patients and can be tested in the models described here, thus supplementing current efforts centered on the dopamine pathway.", "citation_paragraph": "Here, we addressed the involvement of torsinA in the response to ER stress and to the cAMP pathways. How these two pathways are linked mechanistically remains unclear, but it is possible though that the ER stress induced by mutant torsinA in patients with DYT1 dystonia contributes to neuronal dysfunction through a cAMP defect ( Figure 5 ). In our previous studies on the torsinArelated AAA-ATPase p97, which also operates in ERAD and induces ER stress upon dysfunction, we found an inhibitory effect on adenylate cyclase when p97 was mutated [49] . Remarkably, we also observed that 4-PBA treatments can attenuate the ER stress caused by torsinA mutants and this is associated with rescue of the forskolin-induced cAMP-response. We propose that 4-PBA might have therapeutic benefits in patients with dystonia.Defective proteasome function and ER stress have a contributing role in various neurologic diseases [50] . In response to stress, cells temporarily decrease protein synthesis, delay membrane trafficking, increase movement of unfolded proteins out of the ER into the cytoplasm via ERAD, and up-regulate transcription of some chaperone proteins [51] . Recently, our group has shown an aberrant regulation of proteasome activity in dystonia [24] . Protein components of the ERAD pathway, for example, p97 and Derlin-1, as well as torsinA, have been found in inclusion bodies in brain and peripheral nerves from patients with a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, as well as dystonia [52] [53] [54] [55] .Additionally, complementary evidence indicates that torsinA can reduce ER stress caused by ER protein overload in nematodes, and that torsinA deficient MEFs have increased levels of ER stress, as compared with wild-type MEFs [23, 24] . Interestingly, it has been proposed that ER stress can cause down-regulation of cAMP production in diabetes [56] , and that a cAMP elevating reagent (CGS21680, an adenosine A2 receptor agonist) enhances proteasome activity in synapses of the striatum of R6/2 Huntington mouse model [57] . Interestingly, it has been shown that the proteasome activity can be regulated by PKA [58] . Future studies are needed to determine whether the impairment of proteasome activity in cells expressing torsinADE may cause accumulation of PKA regulatory subunits and/or suppression of PKA activity.Our findings linking ER stress and cAMP signaling in dystonia models, also highlights that there is much to consider about striatal and DYT1 patient fibroblast lines (average of three lines: GM02306, GM02551 and GM03211) were treated for 18 hours in the absence or presence of 2.5 or 5 mM concentrations of 4-PBA, then challenged or not with 1 mM thapsigargin (Thaps.) for 3 hours. We have not observed significant differences in sliced XBP1 (sXBP1) levels, an ER stress marker, upon 4-PBA treatments (2.5 and 5 mM) in healthy control or DYT1 fibroblast cells. (B) As shown in (A), healthy fibroblast cells lines (3 lines represented in white 1-3: HF6, HF19, and GM02912) and DYT1 patient fibroblast cell lines (3 lines represented in black 4-6: GM02306, GM02551, and GM03211) were treated for 18 hours in the absence or presence of 10 mM concentration of 4-PBA, then challenged or not with 1 mM thapsigargin (Thaps.) for 3 hours. DYT1 fibroblasts cell lines have increased levels of mRNA expression levels of sliced XBP1 (sXBP1), an ER stress marker, compared to healthy controls (**P,0.01; one-way ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc comparison, n = 3 experiments) when stimulated with thapsigargin. However, when DYT1 fibroblast cells were pre-treated with 10 mM 4-PBA, they showed reduced sXBP1 levels, similar to healthy control lines. A 1.2 reduction in the sXBP levels was observed when DYT1 fibroblast cells challenged with thapsigargin, and treated with 4-PBA (**P,0.01; one-way ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc comparison, n = 3 experiments). The results indicate that the presence of torsinADE induces ER stress in fibroblast cells, however, 10 mM 4-PBA treatment decreases ER stress in DYT1 patient lines. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0110086.g003signaling to cAMP and PKA. Benzodiazepines are frequently used in the treatment of dystonia. This drug has muscle-relaxant properties and alleviates pain caused by muscle spasms and various dystonias [59, 60] . Interestingly, the administration of diazepam, a benzodiazepine anxiolytic, in rhesus monkeys, is known to increase cAMP by inhibiting PDE cAMP hydrolysis [61] . Numerous lines of evidence have linked dopaminergic dysfunction to dystonia [4, 5] . The physiological actions of dopamine are mediated by five distinct but closely related G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are divided into two major groups: the D1 (D1, D5) and D2 (D2, D3. D4) classes of dopamine receptors [62] . The D2 class is coupled to inhibitory G-proteins (G0/i) that decrease adenylate cyclase activity and cAMP levels, in contrast to the D1 class which acts through stimulatory G-proteins (e.g. Gsa) to increase activity and cAMP levels [63] . Dystonia has been associated with mutations in genes encoding proteins critical for dopamine (DA) signaling, such as GTP-cyclohydrolase [34] , tyrosine hydroxylase [35] , as well as polymorphisms in the DA receptor subtype, D5R [64] , and GNAL dystonia gene, which encodes G a olf, a central component for striatal responses to dopamine (DA) [36] . Furthermore, several imaging studies showed various DA-related abnormalities, such as altered receptor binding in basal ganglia, in patients with different forms of dystonia [65] [66] [67] . Interestingly, it has been shown that adenylate cyclase activation by forskolin is highly potentiated in the presence of stimulatory G-proteins, such as G a olf [68] . Mutations in GNAL remove essential functional regions of Gaolf, responsible for activation of the G protein receptor D1 and Adenosine Receptor A2 (A2R), affecting cAMP accumulation. Thus, it is possible that mutations in GNAL and TOR1A genes may lead to dystonia via a common mechanism related to cAMP signaling. Perhaps torsinA participates in the proper folding/oligomerization of GPCR, or stimulatory G-proteins, reducing the function of these proteins.Our results suggest that 4-PBA may have clinical utility in the treatment of dystonia. 4-PBA is a low molecular weight fatty acid already approved for clinical use as an ammonia scavenger in children with urea cycle disorders [69] . Several groups revealed that 4-PBA reverses the mislocalization and/or aggregation of the protein associated with human disease, including the DF508 cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator [47] , mutant a1-antitrypsin [70] . In addition, 4-PBA improves the trafficking of the serotonin transporter (SERT) [71] , by reversing the misfolded proteins and decreasing the protein folding load in the ER, therefore providing protective effects against ER stress. A previous study has shown that 4-PBA treatment decreases ER stress with regard to the following general ER stress markers: BiP, CHOP, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), as well as sXBP1 [56] . Additionally, 4-PBA alleviates ER stress by the Pael receptor, which is thought to be accumulated in PARK2, one type of inherited Parkinson's disease [72] , reduced the area of damage due to ischemia in a rat model of cerebral infarction [73] , it has been found to prolong life [74] , and contribute to therapy for spinal muscular atrophy [75] by altering the pattern of gene expression.4-PBA has high potential to treat neurologic diseases because it penetrates the blood-brain barrier, and exhibits significant neuroprotective effects in mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) [76] , and Parkinson's disease (PD) [77] . As described above 4-PBA has multiple applications. It can be explained by the fact that 4-PBA has also multiple functions. First, 4-PBA may act as a chemical chaperone preventing the mislocalization and/or aggregation of proteins associated with human disease. Second, 4-PBA also possesses histone deacetylase (HDAC)-inhibitor activity. Initially HDAC inhibitors were designed as anti-cancer agents because of their important roles in the epigenetic regulation of protein translation. Recently, HDAC inhibitors have been implicated in the treatment of many neurodegenerative diseases [78] . Furthermore, the HDAC inhibitory function of 4-PBA has also been studied in neurodegenerative diseases related to abnormal histone acetylation, such as Huntington's disease (HD) [79] , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [80] , and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) [75] .The precise steps by which mutant torsinA leads to impaired cAMP accumulation are not known, but it may involve an ER dysfunction. Further studies are needed to test this hypothesis, and to determine the efficacy of treatment of DYT1 dystonia that targets both ER stress and cAMP cascade. More studies are also needed to elucidate whether 4-PBA is functioning as a HDAC inhibitor or as a molecular chaperone in our dystonia cell models. This will provide insightful information for the structural optimization of this compound. Nevertheless, therapies working through the ER stress and cAMP cascade in the striatum may have the potential to benefit dystonia patients by alleviating dystonic symptoms. Animal studies will determine whether 4-PBA can be used to treat, as well as prevent, DYT1 dystonia. Figure S1 Neurons expressing torsinADE has higher ER stress compared to control neurons. Total mRNA was prepared from a mixed neuronal culture of dissociated primary cortical and striatal at E15 from controls littermates torsinA wt/wt , and heterozygotes torsinA wt/DE knock-in dystonia mice (*P,0.001; Student t-test, 2 independent experiments, with average of 2-3 embryos per genotype). Relative expression of sliced sXBP1 mRNA levels was measured by quantitative PCR. Results might indicate that the presence of torsinADE increases ER stress in neurons.

In a review from the Lancet concerning hyperhomocysteinemia in uremic patients, an upper limit of 10 \u00b5mol/L for women and of 12 \u00b5mol/L for men was suggested [22] . We therefore, reanalyzed our data accordingly ( Table 4 ). The Odds ratio (95% CI) of having CKD, comparing subjects with homocysteine above normal to those within normal range remained high for both men and women.As mentioned in the introduction section, there is a question as to whether the high concentration of homocysteine, is a cause for CKD or rather the result of CKD. We have previously showed in a longitudinal historical prospective study that elevated plasma homocysteine levels may be a predictor of accelerated decline in renal function and future incidence of CKD [23] . In that study, 3602 subjects with normal eGFR and no proteinuria, were divided into two groups according to plasma homocysteine levels (\u2264 15, \u2265 15 \u03bcmol/L). Annual eGFR decline was shown to be 25% higher in subjects with elevated plasma homocysteine (0.90 \u00b1 0.16 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 vs. 0.72 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 , p < 0.001). After a median of 7.8 years subjects with elevated plasma homocysteine levels had a significant higher odds ratio of developing CKD (HR 4.85, 95% CI 2.48-9.49, p < 0.001). Similar results were demonstrated by Ninomiya et al., for a Japanese population [24] . Nevertheless, renal impairment per se can affect homocysteine levels by mechanisms which are not clearly understood. In a study by van Guldener et al. [18] it was shown that there is no renal extraction of homocysteine in fasting humans. This lack of filtration and absorption process of homocysteine in the kidney may be due to Table 2 Mean homocysteine plasma levels in subjects with eGFR < 60 or \u2265 60 mL/min/1.73 m Table 3 Odds ratio (95% CI) of having CKD, comparing subjects with homocysteine plasma levels equal and above 15 \u03bcmol/L to those with homocysteine plasma levels less than 15 \u03bcmol/L Table 4 Odds ratio (95% CI) of having CKD, comparing men with homocysteine plasma levels equal and above 12 \u03bcmol/L to men with homocysteine plasma levels less than 12 \u03bcmol/L and comparing women with homocysteine plasma levels equal and above 10 \u03bcmol/L to women with homocysteine plasma levels less than 10 \u03bcmol/L the fact that homocysteine is covalently bound to albumin [17] . Therefore two theories explaining the effect of CKD on homocysteine plasma levels have been suggested. The first theory is that renal protein breakdown in CKD patients is enhanced and the excess release of methionine is converted to homocysteine in the liver. Alternatively it may be speculated that the extra-renal metabolism of homocysteine may be impaired by factors related to uremia [18, 19] . Indeed, in a recent study on dialysis patients, a unique uremic toxin namely lanthionine was found. This toxin may contribute to the genesis of hyperhmocysteienemia found in uremic patients [25] . Possible mechanisms for the association between homocysteine and atherosclerosis were mentioned in the introduction section [9] . The effect of renal impairment on atherosclerosis is only partially mediated by homocysteine [26] . As to the direct effect of homocysteine on kidney function, several pathophysiological factors are suggested. Homocysteine can act directly on glomerular cells inducing sclerosis, and it can initiate renal injury by reducing plasma and tissue levels of adenosine. Decreased plasma adenosine leads to enhanced proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells accelerating sclerotic process in arteries and glomeruli [27] . Homocysteine also oxidizes low-density lipoprotein and thus promotes accelerated intra-renal atherosclerosis and/or arteriolar hyalinosis; this results in reducing the renal perfusion pressure [28, 29] .The inter-relationship between folic acid, vitamin B12, homocysteine and CKD has been revised in detail in two recent reviews [30, 31] . It is a widely known that homocysteine concentrations are affected by concentrations of vitamin B12 and folate, such that low concentrations of these vitamins increase the level of homocysteine [32] . In CKD patients comorbidities and multi drug therapies can lead to malnutrition and subsequently to folic acid and vitamin B12 deficiency. Moreover, folic acid metabolism is impaired in uremic patients and functional vitamin B12 deficiency can be observed because of increased transcobalalmin losses in the urine and reduced absorption in the proximal tubule [30] .Given that plasma homocysteine may contribute to renal failure, it may be argued that lowering the levels of homocysteine may attenuate the risk of future CKD. This has therefore been investigated in patients with coronary heart disease, yet the results have proved contradictory [10] [11] [12] . As to CKD patients, three double blind randomized-controlled trials have assessed the effect of adding folic acid and vitamin B12 on the progression of CKD. In the China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial sub-study on 15,104 participants, it was shown than adding folic acid delayed CKD progression [33] . In the HOST study on 2056 CKD patients, adding high dose of folic acid (40 mg/day) and vitamin B12 (2 mg/day) did not affect CKD progression [34] . Lastly, in the DIVINe study on 238 patients with diabetic nephropathy, adding supplements of folic acid and vitamin B12 caused a greater decrease in GFR [35] .One of the possible explanations of the beneficial effect of folic acid in the Chinese study is that, in contrast with studies in the other regions, this study was carried out in a country without folic acid grain fortification.The main strength of our study is the inclusion of such a large cohort (17010 men and women) with documented homocysteine concentrations, together with complete datasets of clinical and laboratory findings. Nevertheless, this study has its limitations. The study group was not drawn from a population sample, but rather from those attending an examination center which limits the generalizability of the findings. In addition, the cross-sectional design precludes any conclusions regarding causality.In conclusion, the findings of our current cross sectional study, as with our previous longitudinal study, clearly show an association between high levels of plasma homocysteine and renal failure. More prospective studies, particularly in countries that do not fortify foods with vitamins, should be conducted to assess the effect of adding folic acid and vitamin B12 in CKD patients. Such studies may show a positive effect on the progression of the kidney disease by attenuating the homocysteine levels.", "citance": "In the HOST study on 2056 CKD patients, adding high dose of folic acid (40 mg/day) and vitamin B12 (2 mg/day) did not affect CKD progression [34] .", "claims": [{"text": "40mg/day dosage of folic acid and 2mg/day dosage of vitamin B12 does not affect chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression.

Thus, appropriate development of the placenta is crucial for normal fetal development. We investigated the effect of gestational protein restriction (GPR) on placental morphology and mitochondrial function on day 19 of gestation. Pregnant dams were divided into two groups: normal (NP 17 % casein) or low-protein diet (LP 6 % casein). The placentas were processed for biochemical, histomorphometric and ultrastructural analysis. The integrity of rat placental mitochondria (RPM) isolated by conventional differential centrifugation was measured by oxygen uptake (Clark-type electrode). LP animals presented an increase in adipose tissue and triacylglycerol and a decrease in serum insulin levels. No alterations were observed in body, liver, fetus, or placenta weight. There was also no change in serum glucose, total protein, or lipid content. Gestational protein restriction had tissue-specific respiratory effects, with the observation of a small change in liver respiration (~13 %) and considerable respiratory inhibition in placenta samples (~37 %). The higher oxygen uptake by RPM in the LP groups suggests uncoupling between respiration and oxidative phosphorylation. In addition, ultrastructural analysis of junctional zone giant cells from LP placenta showed a disorganized cytoplasm, with loss of integrity of most organelles and intense vacuolization. The present results led us to hypothesize that GPR alters placental structure and morphology, induces sensitivity to insulin, mitochondrial abnormalities and suggests premature aging of the placenta. Further studies are needed to test this hypothesis.", "citation_paragraph": "Maternal nutrient restriction during intrauterine life has been recognized as a cause of mortality at birth (Kingdom et al. 1997 ) and is associated with postnatal kidney dysfunction (Vanp\u00e9e et al. 1992 ) and an increased risk of developing hypertension and cardiovascular disease in adulthood (Barker et al. 1989; Law et al. 1991; de Lima et al. 2012) . About 53 % of perinatal mortality can be attributed to low birth weight (de Onis et al. 2004) . Thus, there is now widespread acceptance that intrauterine life and the first years of life play a crucial role in the development of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases in adulthood (Wintour et al. 2003) .Placental pathologies related to fetal programming, including fetal intrauterine growth restriction, preeclampsia and diabetes, are also associated with hypoxia and oxidative stress in the placenta (Myatt 2006) . Changes in the structure and function of the placenta alter the substrate supply to the fetus and the hormonal environment. The placenta thus assumes an active role in programming the fetal experience in utero which can lead to disease in adult life (Myatt 2006) .The placenta of rats consists of two main regions, the junctional zone (JZ, the interface between maternal and fetal tissues) and the labyrinth zone (LZ, located at the fetal interface). The LZ contains stem cells that either differentiate into trophoblast giant cells or fuse to form syncytial trophoblast giant cells. The JZ of the trophoblast consists of three morphologically distinct cell types: trophoblast giant cells, spongiotrophoblast cells, and glycogen cells (Davies and Glasser 1968) . A previous study showed that maternal protein restriction alters placental composition and surface area, but not fetal capillary surface area, diameter or length ). Almasry and collaborators showed on idiopathic intrauterine growth restriction the histomorphological and pathological changes in the stem villi in human placentae (Almasry et al. 2012a ). Moreover, this group suggested enhanced placental expression and specific cellular localization and of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) are expected to contribute to impaired fetal development in idiopathic fetal growth restriction and the trophoblast giant cells are proposed to be an obvious source of this cytokine in such cases (Almasry et al. 2012b ). We therefore performed morphological and morphometric analysis to identify changes in rat placenta on day 19 of gestation (19 dG).Developmental insults have been suggested to exert permanent effects on health through alterations in tissue morphology. Few studies have investigated the physiology of mitochondria in the placenta. The increased metabolic activity of placental mitochondria throughout pregnancy results in increased oxidative stress during normal pregnancy and is exacerbated in pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia or diabetes (Wang et al. 1992; Giugliano et al. 1996; Al-Gubory et al. 2010) , as demonstrated by the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or decreased levels of antioxidant enzymes. Mortensen et al. (2010) reported, in mice, that maternal protein restriction alters expression of mitochondrial genes, with differential responses to diet in liver and skeletal muscle. Recent report showed that exposure to maternal undernutrition is associated with a decrease in mitochondrial respiration in kidneys of adult rats and suggest that mitochondria may play a role in the early-life programming of adult disease (Engeham et al. 2012) . Changes in the respiration rate indicate variations in mitochondrial ROS production (Kowaltowski et al. 2009 ). In order to determine whether gestational protein restriction (GPR) causes changes in placental mitochondrial function, compromising nutrient transport among other functions and altering fetal development, we investigated the integrity of isolated rat placental mitochondria (RPM) by the measurement of oxygen uptake. In addition, serum glucose, insulin, total protein and lipid content, muscle, placental and liver glycogen, and changes in hepatic morphology and weight were analyzed.", "citance": "About 53 % of perinatal mortality can be attributed to low birth weight (de Onis et al. 2004) .", "claims": [{"text": "5% of perinatal mortality is due to low birth weight.", "subject": "perinatal mortality", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "53% of perinatal mortality is due to low birth weight.", "subject": "perinatal mortality", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 11820746, "title": "Recent advances in acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children and adolescents: an expert panel discussion.", "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common form of childhood leukemia, representing 75% to 80% of cases of acute leukemia among children. Dramatic improvements in the cure rates and survival outcomes for children with ALL have been seen over the past several decades; currently the 5-year survival rate for childhood ALL is more than 80%. These improvements have come about because of advances in the understanding of the molecular genetics and pathogenesis of the disease, incorporation of risk-adapted therapy, and the advent of new targeted agents.   RECENT FINDINGS Scientific advances have provided new insights into leukemogenesis, drug resistance, and host pharmacogenomics, identified novel subtypes of leukemia, and suggested potential targets for therapy. At the same time novel monoclonal antibodies, small molecule inhibitors, chemotherapeutics, and cell-based treatment strategies have been developed and investigated.   SUMMARY In this article, experts will discuss some of the current challenges and future directions in the treatment of pediatric ALL. The authors will offer expert guidance to practicing oncologists on how to best incorporate newer treatment approaches into the care of children and adolescents with ALL. The most important ongoing clinical trials in the area will also be reviewed.", "citation_paragraph": "Dr Gaynon: We have made little progress in treating relapse in recent years [6] .Dr Whitlock: One of the challenges that we face in patients who relapse (at least in patients with high-risk or early relapse) is that a significant proportion will not even be able to attain another remission. In a COG study of first relapse patients (AALL01P2), only two-thirds of patients relapsing less than 36 months from diagnosis attained a second remission after a course of reinduction therapy. And among those who did attain a second remission, fully three-quarters of them had detectable MRD [46] . We do not face this challenge in patients with newly diagnosed ALL; virtually all of those patients will enter a remission, so this issue distinguishes relapse treatment from frontline therapy.Another issue concerning relapse is that in an attempt to improve remission rates, we have tried many different very intensive regimens of cytotoxic drugs which are often at the limits of tolerability. In Paul's CCG study for relapsed ALL, over 10% of patients died during reinduction therapy [47] . In our current protocols, we are seeing increasingly significant infectious complications, not just bacterial infections, but an increasing incidence of fungal infections that become huge challenges to manage.The role of stem cell transplantation in ALL remains unclear. Dr Gaynon [47] conducted a randomized study a number of years ago that tried to answer this question in relapse, but did not show a clear advantage of allogeneic transplant over chemotherapy. Even today, we struggle with the role of stem cell transplantation in patients with relapse -which patients are likely to benefit from transplant, and in which patients is the standard approach to transplant likely to fail?We know that stem cell transplantation has the potential to be curative. Most high-risk or early relapse patients will undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation and yet many of those patients will relapse after transplantation and still die [48, 49] . So whatever we are doing with transplantation, it is not as successful as it needs to be. Somehow we have to either find better therapies that will replace transplantation or we need to improve stem cell transplantation itself. MRD is proving to be an important tool for stratifying patients for transplant. A study in relapsed ALL patients from the BFM group found that patients with detectable MRD prior to allogeneic transplant had a significantly worse outcome than those without detectable MRD prior to transplant, indicating that MRD is an important prognostic factor for posttransplant outcome [50] .Dr Gaynon: I hope that we can someday replace stem cell transplant. Unfortunately, ablation is just one course of therapy and you only have a few days to deliver that therapy. Many of the agents that Dr Whitlock is working on are promising. We talk about an immune effect and we have some interesting drugs like the bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) construct blinatumomab [51] .Dr Whitlock: Yes, although I think it is fair to say that those are still so early in development that I do not think we really know what their impact is going to be. We are all very excited about it and we anticipate that they are going to be important contributors, but it is a little too early to declare success.Dr Gaynon: I am getting more and more excited about our TACL study with the Toll-like receptor agonist that may enhance the immunogenicity of the leukemia cells [52] . Some interesting studies examine the role of the demethylating agents and immune modulation, by exposing the methylated CpG motifs for immune attack. Is there a subset of patients for whom epigenetic therapy makes more sense than for other subsets of patients; infants and older patients with MLL rearrangements, perhaps?Dr Asselin: Yes, so certainly stem cell transplant is the example of us getting our biggest hammer and, you know, I am just not feeling that we have an alternative at this point so... Dr Gaynon: And stem cell transplant has cured many children who are alive today, no question.All too often I send a child to transplant and I feel like I am a success. The patient goes through transplant and then gets past the 100-day mark and the transplanter feels like he is a success too. Then the patient relapses 2 months later. The doctors are all successful, but the patient will get more toxic therapy, perhaps a second transplant, and then expire.We really have no idea of the molecular changes that cause relapse. A recent paper about the defect in the gene that encodes for 5'-nucleotidase reported promising findings. 5'-nucleotidase is an enzyme that metabolizes 6MP [53] . Meyer et al. [53] found the mutation in a substantial subset of patients who have early relapse, but never in late relapse patients.A group of patients may need a particular therapeutic approach that does not benefit other subsets. I expect we are going to learn something from this work that will help us direct appropriate patients to the most appropriate novel agents.The key is to be able to understand the pathophysiology of treatment failure. We should be studying first, second, and third relapse samples to learn how leukemias evolve. Our so-called models are inadequate. Greaves' work [54] on Darwinian evolution of a leukemia population explains so many things. When you grow leukemia cells in a Petri dish, the subclones that like Petri dishes grow. When leukemia cells grow in a patient, you may get different clones altogether. Differences in risk stratification and prognostic indicators in adolescents versus younger children Dr Gaynon: We see more Ph-positive leukemia in our older populations. When we have a 17-year-old with a 200 000 white blood cell count and B-precursor leukemia, we want to make sure we are not dealing with Ph-positive leukemia. The important other factor in adolescents is that older teenagers are less tolerant of therapy. In the CSG-1961 study for patients over age 16, a quarter of adverse events were toxic deaths so that we have to be mindful of the specific challenge [56] .We see more asparaginase toxicity in the older patients and what I am seeing now, which I cannot recall in the past, I think I am seeing more chronic pancreatitis (personal observation). I have patients with one episode at the end of induction and then recurrent episodes of pancreatitis despite no further asparaginase during 2-3 years of therapy.Dr Asselin: Well, yes, I have seen and also I hear about or get called about patients in that same situation and there are a couple of different things that it really brings to mind. Certainly, there are other drugs that are associated with pancreatitis. If you look at the medication list of these patients now, they often are on so many other supportive therapies with overlapping toxicities.In older patients, we have to keep in mind the influence of alcohol or other drug use and then there are also genetic factors both in terms of general family history and some specific genotypes (e.g., cystic fibrosis gene abnormalities and genotypes) that genome-wide screening may help us to figure out. In the past, prognosis of ALL was related to disease control and the likelihood of cure of the leukemia.But now it has also become important to take into account the different toxicity risks and all of the concerns about osteonecrosis and the fact that we have not put dexamethasone into induction regimens for the older patients for fear of AVN. This affects our treatment decisions both in terms of determining the best treatment to cure their leukemia and finding the right balance of risk of late effects.Dr Gaynon: Well, I thought it was very surprising that we have had dexamethasone and prednisone since the 1960s, but no one knew that adolescents metabolized these drugs more slowly than younger children so this illustrates how little we may know about the drugs that we use so frequently.", "citance": "5'-nucleotidase is an enzyme that metabolizes 6MP [53] .", "claims": [{"text": "5'-nucleotidase metabolizes 6MP.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Studies herein tested whether radiation impairs protective adaptive SMC responses during vascular disease. To do this, we exposed SMC lineage tracing (Myh11-ERT2Cre YFP+) mice to lethal radiation (1,200 cGy) followed by bone marrow transplantation prior to atherosclerosis development or vessel injury. Surprisingly, following irradiation, we observed a complete loss of SMC investment in 100% of brachiocephalic artery (BCA), carotid artery, and aortic arch lesions. Importantly, this was associated with a decrease in multiple indices of atherosclerotic lesion stability within the BCA. Interestingly, we observed anatomic heterogeneity, as SMCs accumulated normally into lesions of the aortic root and abdominal aorta, suggesting that SMC sensitivity to lethal irradiation occurs in blood vessels of neural crest origin.

We performed a retrospective analysis of 342 patient charts from women seeking an office abortion in a private practice setting from January 1999 to June 2001. Data extracted included demographic information, primary method of contraception over the preceding few months, compliance with that method, contraceptive history, knowledge of emergency contraception and postabortion contraception. Patients were primarily white (69%) and unmarried (63%) and had private insurance that covered abortion services (72%). Only 19% of women were using a birth control method with no recognized potential failure. Twenty-two percent of women were using their birth control method correctly but experienced an event that put them at risk for pregnancy, 32% were using their birth control method incorrectly and 27% were using no birth control method at all. Miscommunication between patients and their healthcare provider(s) negatively affected use of a primary contraceptive method in 14% of patients. Of the 77% of women who did not know about emergency contraception, nearly two thirds had an identifiable event for which emergency contraception could have been used. Healthcare providers may contribute to the occurrence of unintended pregnancy if they provide poor medical advice or miscommunicate with patients.", "citation_paragraph": "A survey conducted about public perspectives regarding unplanned pregnancies and contraception revealed that 60% of Americans believe unplanned pregnancies to be a major problem in the United States [1] . This perception is real, as approximately half of all pregnancies in the United States are unintended. Excluding miscarriages, about 25% of all the pregnancies in the United States end in abortion [2] .Patterns of unplanned pregnancies and abortions vary by age. Pregnancies are unintended in 83%, 33% and 51% of women younger than 18 years, 30 to 34 years and 40 years and older, respectively [2] . By age 45, 43% of women will have had an abortion [2] . These rates, on the surface, are surprising, given the numerous contraceptive options available to women in the United States.Almost 50% of women with unplanned pregnancies were using some form of birth control during the month they became pregnant [2] . Even accounting for the variable efficacy between birth control methods, the fact that a couple was using a method demonstrates they were cognizant of their risk of pregnancy and were taking measures to prevent it. In addition, since the advent of emergency contraception, a woman's ability to decrease her risk of pregnancy has been extended from methods used before and during acts of intercourse to methods available after any particular act of intercourse. A 1993 study looking at secondary contraception among women seeking an abortion indicated that 93% would have preferred to use postcoital contraception than experience an unplanned pregnancy [3] . The majority (65%) of these women had received their contraceptive counseling from either a general practitioner or a community family clinic. Yet, only 20% of the women who might have benefited from emergency contraception (EC) (i.e., recognized a potential contraception failure or used no contraception) had adequate knowledge of its existence, timing or source.Scenarios such as these highlight the importance of the relationship between preventative contraceptive counseling from a healthcare provider and unplanned pregnancies. While the element of a patient's compliance with any birth control regimen cannot be controlled, an open and accurate exchange of information between patient and healthcare provider can be controlled. Miscommunication or misinformation that is present during health provider contact can have a significant impact on future contraception choices. This study was performed to examine the impact of counseling by healthcare providers in the case of unintended pregnancy. The goal was to understand if there is potentially a need for healthcare providers to improve communication with patients in order to decrease the rate of unintended pregnancy.", "citance": "A 1993 study looking at secondary contraception among women seeking an abortion indicated that 93% would have preferred to use postcoital contraception than experience an unplanned pregnancy [3] .", "claims": [{"text": "93% of women seeking an abortion in 1993 preferred to experience an unplanned pregnancy rather than use post-coital contraception.

It is a rapid blood schizonticide recommended, in combination with proguanil, in areas dominated by P. vivax or in areas where P. falciparum is still sensitive to chloroquine, such as Central America and Middle Eastern countries [6] .It is effective against P. malariae and against erythrocytic forms of P. vivax and P. ovale, although reports on the appearance of genetic mutations conferring resistance to chloroquine have recently appeared [1] . When administered orally, blood peak concentration is reached in 1-6 hours. Its half-life, initially of 3-6 days, becomes 12-14 days with protracted intake. It's metabolised in di-ethylchloroquine and it is excreted largely unchanged by the kidney. Chloroquine chemoprophylactic regimen in adults is 300 mg base/week (5 mg base/Kg/die in children) starting one week before the trip up to four weeks after return [43] (Table 3) . It can induce several side effects, usually mild [44] , including insomnia, nausea, headache, dizziness, blurred vision and itching. A cumulative dose of 100g may result in retinal toxicity, generally after 5-6 years of weekly intake [45] . Rare cases of central nervous system toxicity with seizures and mental disorders, myopathy, hearing loss, photosensitivity, hair loss and bone marrow suppression with aplastic anemia have also been reported [1] . Some studies have demonstrated its potential role in inducing psychosis [46] or \"non convulsive status epilepticus\" [47] . These findings emphasize that chloroquine should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy.In a study carried out on 6216 Peace Corps Volunteers in malaria endemic countries undergoing antimalarial prophylaxis for more than six months with chloroquine versus mefloquine versus doxycycline, chloroquine presented the safest profile, with lower incidence of serious adverse events requiring prophylaxis modifications in comparison with mefloquine and doxycycline [48] . Interactions with other drugs are very unusual. There is an increased risk of arrhythmias if chloroquine is administred concomitantly with drugs that prolong QT interval such as halofantrine. An increased risk of seizure or acute dystonia has been reported in association with mefloquine and metronidazole, respectively. Chloroquine reduces the bioavailability of both ampicillin and praziquantel and the therapeutic effect of thyroxine. On the contrary, it increases plasma concentrations of cyclosporine. It has a possible antagonist effect if administered together with carbamazepine and sodium valproate [1] .The first case of P. falciparum resistance to chloroquine has occurred in Thailand and Cambodia in the late 50s, only 12 years after the introduction of the drug. Since 1980, P. falciparum strains resistant to chloroquine have spread in South America, and since 1989 in Asia and Oceania. In Africa, chloroquine resistance of P. falciparum emerged in 1978 in the eastern areas and it has then spread to the whole of the African continent in the 80s. Currently, resistance to chloroquine is widespread in P.falciparum endemic areas, with the exception of Central America and the Caribbean. The parasites with greater resistance are generally those harbouring Lys76Thr and Ala220Ser mutations in PfCRT and Asn86tyr mutations in PfMDR1 [1] . Pfmdr1 duplication suggests a possible cross-resistance with mefloquine, which needs further studies to be confirmed [49] .", "citance": "A cumulative dose of 100g may result in retinal toxicity, generally after 5-6 years of weekly intake [45] .", "claims": [{"text": "A 100g dose of chloroquine chemoprophylactic regimen results in retinal toxicity after 1 year of weekly intake.", "subject": "chloroquine chemoprophylactic", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "A 100g dose of chloroquine chemoprophylactic regimen results in retinal toxicity after 5-6 years of weekly intake.", "subject": "chloroquine chemoprophylactic", "is_negation": false}]}

However, growing evidence suggests that cells and mediators typically associated with type 2 inflammation are involved in several physiopathological conditions, such as defense against toxic substances, anticancer immunity, and autoimmune diseases. In neuromyelitis optica, an autoimmune demyelinating disorder of the spinal cord and optic nerve, eosinophils extensively infiltrate lesions in the central nervous system (CNS) and promote tissue pathology in experimental models of this disease. Next-generation sequencing of CD4+ T cells isolated from a specific subtype of multiple sclerosis plaque has uncovered an unexpectedly Th2 profile of these cells. Even mast cells and other allergic mediators have been implicated in the modulation and/or effector mechanisms of autoimmune reactions against the CNS. In this review article, the most recent developments showing the involvement of type 2 inflammatory components in CNS autoimmunity are summarised and possible lines of further investigation are discussed.", "citation_paragraph": "Studies discussed in this review article highlight that type 2 immunity might be implicated in autoimmune responses against the CNS (Figure 1 ). Immune cells and mediators typical of allergic inflammation have been found in NMO and, in certain circumstances, even MS, as suggested by the presence of Th2 cells in pattern II lesions of SPMS and by the colocalization of MCs and T cells in the meninges of a subset of patients. A common feature between NMO and pattern II MS lesions is the deposition of Ig and the complement, which suggests the involvement of humoral responses in the pathogenic processes driving tissue destruction in these disorders. Interestingly, in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), long considered a Th1-and Th17-driven disease with a strong autoantibody response, a Th2 environment and basophils have been recently shown to importantly promote disease development [84] . Deeper investigation is necessary to better understand the involvement of allergic components and their possible interplay with humoral responses in the context of CNS autoimmunity. Analyses in a larger cohort of MS patients are required to understand whether Th2 cells commonly infiltrate CNS lesions characterized by Ig deposition and to verify whether this Th2 shift is age-dependent. Indeed, brain aging has been recently shown to promote Th2 polarization of CNS-specific T cells at the choroid plexus [85] .In experimental models of CNS autoimmunity, it has been clearly demonstrated that the polarization of myelinreactive CD4 + T cells has a significant impact on the outcome of the therapeutic regimen applied. Indeed, while neutralizing antibodies against IL-17 and GM-CSF protect from Th17-induced passive EAE in SJL/J mice, they are completely ineffective in counteracting Th1-mediated EAE in the same strain [29] . Even more strikingly, treatment with IFN-\u03b2 reduces disease symptoms in passive EAE induced by Th1 cells but exacerbates Th17-mediated passive EAE in C57BL/6 mice [86] . These findings have been paralleled by data on MS, showing that patients unresponsive to IFN-\u03b2 therapy exhibit significantly higher serum levels of IL-17F and IFN-\u03b2 at the pretreatment stage compared to responder patients [87] . In opticospinal variants of MS and in NMO, the treatment with either IFN-\u03b2 or DMF leads to the exacerbation of clinical symptoms [88] [89] [90] . Of note, both IFN-\u03b2 and DMF have been shown to promote the Th2 profile [13, 14, 91] . Studies performed in experimental models of CNS autoimmunity have provided clear evidence of the possibly concomitant development of autoimmune and allergic reactions against myelin antigens. Indeed, in EAE models mediated by Th1/Th17 responses, the reexposure to the immunization antigen can promote the development of the most severe manifestation of allergy, that is, anaphylaxis [71, 92] . Overall, these data suggest that the potential occurrence of type 2 immune responses in NMO and in certain subtypes and/or stages of MS should be taken into consideration when designing and evaluating novel immunomodulatory approaches for the treatment of these diseases.", "citance": "Interestingly, in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), long considered a Th1-and Th17-driven disease with a strong autoantibody response, a Th2 environment and basophils have been recently shown to importantly promote disease development [84] .", "claims": [{"text": "A T helper 2 cell (Th2) environment impedes disease development in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).", "subject": "systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "A T helper 2 cell (Th2) environment promotes disease development in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).", "subject": "systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Basophils counteract disease development in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).", "subject": "systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Basophils promote disease development in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).", "subject": "systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)", "is_negation": false}]}

{"s2orc_id": 25262923, "title": "Barrett's esophagus: prevalence in symptomatic relatives", "abstract": "OBJECTIVE:Relatives of patients with Barrett's esophagus have an increased prevalence of reflux symptoms. Our aim was to find if these relatives were at increased risk of having Barrett's esophagus.METHODS:First degree relatives of patients with Barrett's esophagus completed the Reflux Symptom Questionnaire. Relatives with reflux symptoms, never previously investigated, were invited for endoscopy. Controls were patients with similar reflux symptoms and no family histories of Barrett's esophagus.RESULTS:We found previously undiagnosed Barrett's esophagus (>3 cm) in eight of 100 relatives (8%) from 53 families and in five of 100 controls (5%) (adjusted OR = 1.58, 95% CI = 0.46\u20135.45). Including another 27 previously investigated cases, 10 of the 53 families had two or more cases of Barrett's esophagus. Barrett's esophagus prevalence increased with age (p = 0.014) and was associated with reflux symptoms of >10 yr (p = 0.020), and Barrett's esophagus was twice as common in males (p = 0.28). Reflux esophagitis was found in 74% of relatives and 57% of controls without Barrett's (p = 0.04).CONCLUSIONS:The risk of Barrett's esophagus in any one symptomatic relative of a patient with Barrett's esophagus was not statistically higher than in other persons with reflux symptoms. However, more relatives of Barrett's esophagus patients have reflux symptoms, so the overall prevalence of Barrett's esophagus and reflux esophagitis in relatives may also be greater than in the general population. In considering whether to screen patients with reflux symptoms for Barrett's esophagus, age and duration of symptoms are stronger predictors than having a relative with Barrett's esophagus.", "citation_paragraph": "In this study of Barrett's esophagus in relatives of Barrett's esophagus patients, we found Barrett's esophagus (3 cm or longer) in 8% of relatives with reflux symptoms and in 5% of unrelated persons with similar reflux symptoms.Most patients found to have Barrett's esophagus have reflux symptoms. In our previous study (12) , about 40% of relatives of Barrett's esophagus patients also had reflux symptoms. Barrett's esophagus is uncommon in subjects without reflux symptoms; in one study, Barrett's esophagus was found in 8% of patients with heartburn and 0.32% of patients without heartburn (14) . We elected to study the symptomatic relatives, at highest risk for Barrett's esophagus. We thought it was not practical to investigate all relatives of the index Barrett's esophagus patients, noting that only 64% of relatives contacted completed our symptom questionnaire.Excluding subjects with Barrett's esophagus, we found esophageal erosions in 74% of relatives, more than in the 57% of symptomatic controls. These numbers compare with the reported range of 38 -75% for erosions found in individuals with reflux symptoms (15) . We probably evaluated the esophagogastric junction in greater detail than at the standard clinical examination, often finding small erosions. Erosions involving \u03fe10% of the lower esophageal circumference were present in 43% of our patients.Our controls were older than the relatives (median age \u03ed 55 vs 47 yr), but fewer had heartburn for 10 yr or more. These differences, which had opposing effects in determining Barrett's esophagus prevalence, along with male versus Figure 1 . The prevalence of Barrett's esophagus at different ages in 200 subjects with reflux symptoms. Data from 100 symptomatic relatives and 100 symptomatic controls are combined. Numbers of subjects having endoscopies in each age group are shown. Prevalence increased with age; p for trend \u03ed 0.014. female sex, were allowed for in the multivariate regression analysis.In recruiting subjects for the present study, we doubt that much bias resulted from excluding the 8% of relatives who had previous endoscopies. In our previous study (12) , using the same criteria for reflux, symptoms were reported by 46% of parents and siblings and 36% of adult children of Barrett's esophagus index patients. In the present study, after excluding those with previous endoscopies, we found that a similar 44% of relatives had reflux symptoms. It seems unlikely that those with worse symptoms were excluded because of previous endoscopies, and that we were studying only the less severe cases. Barrett's esophagus was confirmed in 14% of relatives with previous endoscopies whose records and histological slides we reviewed, versus 8% of relatives having study endoscopies. All the relatives we investigated had reflux symptoms at least weekly, and often daily, and 68% had symptoms for 10 yr or longer. Symptom severity does not discriminate between reflux patients with and without Barrett's esophagus (16) .This study showed a nonsignificant adjusted OR of 1.58 for Barrett's esophagus in symptomatic relatives compared to symptomatic controls. Although we investigated a total of 200 persons, the number found to have Barrett's esophagus was small (n \u03ed 13), resulting in low power to detect associations. The Barrett's esophagus risk for the individual symptomatic relative who has one family member with Barrett's esophagus is not greatly increased.A clear distinction should be made between the risk of Barrett's esophagus in the individual relative with reflux symptoms and the risk for all Barrett's esophagus relatives as a group. In two previous reports, first degree relatives of Barrett's esophagus patients had weekly reflux symptoms 2.2 (12) and 4.8 (13) times more often than controls. If a Barrett's esophagus relative has a significantly increased risk for reflux symptoms, and those with symptoms have a 1.58 times risk for Barrett's esophagus, then the Barrett's esophagus risk for Barrett's esophagus relatives as a group is likely higher than normal.We performed endoscopies in 100 symptomatic relatives from 53 families of patients with Barrett's esophagus. Including other relatives who had previous endoscopies and index patients, we found eight families with two Barrett's esophagus cases and two families with three Barrett's esophagus cases. The true number of Barrett's esophagus cases in these families is probably greater, because we could not investigate nonresponding or dead relatives. In the general population reflux symptoms are common (17) , but most persons with Barrett's esophagus have not been detected (18) . We suggest that families with two or even three members having Barrett's esophagus will be found quite often, if the relatives undergo endoscopy.Previous studies showed an increased prevalence of reflux symptoms in relatives of patients with Barrett's esophagus (12, 13) . We now report that the prevalence of esophagitis in symptomatic Barrett's esophagus relatives is greater than in symptomatic controls. This indicates that esophagitis, not just symptomatic reflux, may be more prevalent in families of patients with Barrett's esophagus. In reports of kindreds with familial Barrett's esophagus, some family members had reflux disease without Barrett's esophagus (5, 6, 8) . A genetic liability to gastroesophageal reflux disease, resulting in Barrett's esophagus, has been proposed (5). In severe pediatric reflux disease, recent data suggest that a gene maps to chromosome 13q14 (19) . Familial reflux may be the underlying cause in many instances of familial Barrett's esophagus.In rare instances, larger numbers of Barrett's esophagus cases in the same kindred have been found. Jochem et al. (6) described a family with six cases of Barrett's esophagus over three generations, and proposed an autosomal dominant inheritance of Barrett's esophagus. Eng et al. (8) reported another family with seven Barrett's esophagus cases, including five of seven siblings, and one adult child of two of these siblings. These families might have an unusual or additive genetic factor predisposing to Barrett's esophagus.The prevalence of Barrett's esophagus increased with age in our study, consistent with this being an acquired disorder, as previously reported (14, 20) . By contrast, the prevalence of reflux esophagitis did not increase with age. It is possible that some of our relatives and controls will develop Barrett's esophagus when older, so we may have underestimated the lifetime risk for Barrett's esophagus in both groups. We found Barrett's esophagus about twice as frequently in males. Although this difference did not reach statistical significance, a similar 2:1 male/female ratio was noted in a larger Barrett's esophagus study we previously reported (20) . Consistent with previous reports (21, 22) , we found Barrett's esophagus more often in subjects with long histories of reflux symptoms than in those with shorter histories. These findings may have clinical relevance. Endoscopic screening of patients with reflux symptoms has been proposed, to find Barrett's esophagus cases that can be entered into a cancer surveillance program, although the value of such screening is unproven. Our data indicate that increasing age and long duration of symptoms are stronger predictors of Barrett's esophagus than having one family member with Barrett's esophagus.In brief, we previously showed an increased prevalence of reflux symptoms in relatives of patients with Barrett's esophagus. We now report that these symptomatic relatives do not have a statistically significant increased risk of Barrett's esophagus compared to unrelated persons with reflux symptoms.", "citance": "In severe pediatric reflux disease, recent data suggest that a gene maps to chromosome 13q14 (19) .", "claims": [{"text": "A gene found on chromosome 13q14 contributes to severe pediatric reflux disease.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

We hypothesized that hemoglobinopathic erythrocytes reduce the intraerythrocytic multiplication of P. falciparum, potentially delaying the development of life-threatening parasite densities until parasite clearing immunity is achieved.   METHODS We developed a novel in vitro assay to quantify the number of merozoites released from an individual schizont, termed the \"intraerythrocytic multiplication factor\" (IMF).   RESULTS P. falciparum (3D7 line) schizonts produce variable numbers of merozoites in all erythrocyte types tested, with median IMFs of 27, 27, 29, 23, and 23 in control, HbAS, HbSS, and \u03b1- and \u03b2-thalassemia trait erythrocytes, respectively. IMF correlated strongly (r(2) = 0.97; P < .001) with mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, and varied significantly with mean corpuscular volume and hemoglobin content. Reduction of IMFs in thalassemia trait erythrocytes was confirmed using clinical parasite isolates with different IMFs. Mathematical modeling of the effect of IMF on malaria progression indicates that the lower IMF in thalassemia trait erythrocytes limits parasite density and anemia severity over the first 2 weeks of parasite replication.   CONCLUSIONS P. falciparum IMF, a parasite heritable virulence trait, correlates with erythrocyte indices and is reduced in thalassemia trait erythrocytes. Parasite IMF should be examined in other low-indices erythrocytes.", "citation_paragraph": "Here we have explored the intraerythrocytic multiplication characteristics of the human malaria parasite P. falciparum within hemoglobinopathic erythrocytes in vitro to test the hypothesis that hemoglobinopathies affect parasite multiplication in vivo. We used a novel assay that accurately quantifies the number of merozoites released from individual schizont-infected erythrocytes, the \"intraerythrocytic multiplication factor\" (IMF). The median IMF of the laboratory adapted P. falciparum 3D7 line assessed in control erythrocytes conforms well with the initial 3D7 parasite growth rates in the blood of volunteers [27] . We found that mean IMFs are higher in HbSS, equal in HbAS, and lower in \u03b1-and \u03b2-thalassemia trait erythrocytes, than in control erythrocytes. Similar IMF reductions in thalassemia trait erythrocytes were also seen for 2 clinical parasite isolates. Because HbAS and HbSS erythrocytes are associated with equal or higher IMF values, this parameter is unlikely to account for the lower parasite densities found in HbAS and HbSS African children or the malaria protective effects of HbAS (reviewed in [2] ). Other protective mechanisms, such as impaired cytoadherence of parasitized erythrocytes to microvascular endothelial cells [5] [6] [7] , early removal of infected cells from the circulation [10] , and defective parasite egress from dehydrated sickle cell erythrocytes [11] may negate the virulent effects of elevated IMF in HbAS and HbSS erythrocytes. However, lower IMFs in thalassemia trait erythrocytes suggest that \u03b1-and \u03b2-thalassemia traits may confer protection against severe malaria by limiting the rapid development of high parasite densities and associated severe anemia episodes, both of which are associated with fatal malaria. This logical conclusion is in accord with the results of our mathematical modeling, in which isogenic parasites produced either 26 or 22 merozoites per schizont in normal and thalassemia trait individuals, respectively, in the presence of an innate immune response. In addition to decreased IMF, a higher microerythrocyte count may protect against severe anemia in homozygous alpha(+)-thalassemia trait subjects [34] .Our results suggest new directions to explore parasite virulence. First, our findings that erythrocyte indices, especially MCHC, strongly influence IMF suggest that other hemoglobinopathic erythrocytes differing in these parameters may also significantly affect IMF-a readily testable hypothesis. For example, HbAC and HbCC erythrocytes have relatively high MCHC values, and HbE erythrocytes, which are also inherently \u03b2-thalassemic [35] , have relatively low MCV and MCH but normal MCHC values [35, 36] . The combination of these characteristics, and the apparent selective invasion of HbE erythrocyte subsets by merozoites [37] , may limit parasite replication in vivo. Second, our data predict that IMFs are reduced in the microcytic, hypochromic erythrocytes associated with irondeficiency anemia. If true, this finding may help to explain how iron-deficiency anemia protects against P. falciparum malaria [38, 39] , and how iron supplementation increases the morbidity and mortality of this disease (reviewed in [40] ). Third, we found that IMF of various parasite strains can differ substantially (nearly 2-fold) in both control and hemoglobinopathic erythrocytes, suggesting that IMF is a parasite-heritable trait that can be mapped in phenotype-genotype association studies of parasite virulence. Finally, it is likely that hemoglobinopathies may also affect the IMF of P. vivax and other Plasmodium species that infect humans.How the intraerythrocytic Hb concentration affects merozoite biomass requires further investigation. P. falciparum parasites digest more Hb than they utilize to harvest amino acids [41] , extruding excess amounts in a likely effort to preserve erythrocyte osmotic stability [42] . Erythrocytes with low Hb concentration probably provide suboptimal conditions both for the synthesis of parasite proteins and maintenance of osmotic homeostasis. The lower IMF in thalassemia trait erythrocytes, as compared with normal cells, was observed for parasite isolates having both low and high IMFs, suggesting that the physical parameters of these erythrocytes are likely to affect IMF independently of the type of thalassemia trait. Factors other than Hb concentration may affect the merozoite biomass, as exemplified by the high IMFs we observed for the P. falciparum 3D7 line in HbSS erythrocytes. Paradoxically, deviations of HbSS cells from normal physiology [43] may be beneficial to merozoite production.To explore whether putative lower IMFs in thalassemia trait carriers may help to protect patients from developing severe malaria, we used techniques of population modeling to follow /\u00b5L (5% of the basal RBC count) at 10, 12, 14, and 16 days after the beginning of asexual parasite replication (ie, after primary release from the liver). The gray-scale code for IMF is used here as in Figure 5A . B, The fraction of simulations for which \u0394RBC exceeds 2.5 \u00d7 10 5 /\u03bcL in different parts of the parameter space of the model immune response at 14 and 16 days after primary release. The 10 000 simulations done for each IMF are binned by their values of threshold density of merozoites that triggers the response, Th, and maximum killing rate of infected RBCs, \u03c7 Max . The horizontal extent of the blocks shows the bin size Th, and the vertical extent shows the bin size \u03c7 Max . Note that 2.5 \u00d7 10 4 /\u00b5L is 5% of the basal RBC count. Abbreviation: RBC, red blood cell.2 measures of disease progression-parasite density and erythrocyte loss. Our model assumes that normal and thalassemic individuals are infected with the same parasite, and that their erythrocytes produce 26 and 22 merozoites per schizont, respectively. In the absence of an immune response, \"IMF = 26\" cases are expected to have higher parasite densities than \"IMF = 22\" cases. We asked whether the innate immune response, being triggered earlier in IMF = 26 cases, blunts the rise in parasite density to that of IMF = 22 cases. The simulations predict that lower IMF values will benefit the majority of individuals early in infection, due to delayed onset of high parasite densities and slower progression to anemia, potentially preventing the development of severe malaria early in infection. As a consequence, the adaptive immune responses needed to rapidly clear patients' parasite densities and resolve their anemia will be developed. Additional refinement of the model, coupled with IMF data obtained ex vivo from hemoglobinopathic patients with malaria, could further improve our understanding of parasite virulence.", "citance": "In addition to decreased IMF, a higher microerythrocyte count may protect against severe anemia in homozygous alpha(+)-thalassemia trait subjects [34] .Our", "claims": [{"text": "A high microerythrocyte count protects against severe anemia in homozygous alpha (+)- thalassemia trait subjects.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "A high microerythrocyte count raises vulnerability to severe anemia in homozygous alpha (+)- thalassemia trait subjects.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}

However, emerging evidence suggests that forcing the beta cell to secrete insulin at a time when it is struggling to cope with the demands of obesity and insulin resistance may accelerate its demise. Studies on families with persistent hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia of infancy (PHHI), the primary defect of which is hypersecretion of insulin, have shown that overt diabetes can develop later in life despite normal insulin sensitivity. In addition, in vitro experiments have suggested that reducing insulin secretion from islets isolated from patients with diabetes can restore insulin pulsatility and improve function. This article will explore the hypothesis that forcing the beta cell to hypersecrete insulin may be counterproductive and lead to dysfunction and death via mechanisms that may involve the endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stress. We suggest that, in diabetes, therapeutic approaches should be targeted towards relieving the demand on the beta cell to secrete insulin.", "citation_paragraph": "endoplasmic reticulum NNT nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase PERK RNA-dependent protein kinase-like ER kinase PHHI persistent hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia of infancy ROS reactive oxygen speciesInsulin hypersecretion, beta cell dysfunction and diabetes Type 2 diabetes is the result of two defects: insulin resistance in peripheral tissues (predominantly muscle, fat and liver), and islet beta cell dysfunction causing reduced insulin secretion. Insulin resistance, whether induced or genetic, may be the initiating defect, which in the first instance is compensated for by an increase in insulin secretion [1] . However, in some individuals the beta cell compensatory response to insulin resistance fails or is insufficient, resulting in hyperglycaemia. Since hyperglycaemia itself is damaging to the beta cell, its emergence sets up a vicious cycle of increasing glycaemia and deteriorating beta cell function. While a number of causes of beta cell dysfunction have been suggested, including glucose toxicity, lipotoxicity and amyloid deposition, the mechanisms involved are not fully understood. In this article we propose that, paradoxically, an important mechanism contributing to beta cell failure in type 2 diabetes is the ability to hypersecrete insulin. Thus, a characteristic that in the early stages of the disease is beneficial in the maintenance of normal glucose tolerance, in itself leads to the more rapid demise of the beta cell and development of frank diabetes. This topic will be explored by addressing three simple questions:1. Is there evidence that insulin hypersecretion can precede beta cell dysfunction? 2. Can primary (genetic) insulin hypersecretion result in diabetes? 3. If insulin hypersecretion is reduced, can beta cell function be improved in diabetes?In the remainder of the article, some of the mechanisms that may be responsible for hypersecretion-induced beta cell dysfunction will be discussed.Can insulin hypersecretion precede beta cell dysfunction and diabetes? Insulin hypersecretion can be secondary to the presence of insulin resistance; however, studies on obese individuals have shown that insulin hypersecretion can also occur independent of insulin resistance [2] . Specifically this study showed that insulin resistance was present in 34% of European white individuals with a BMI of 30-35 kg/m 2 , while insulin hypersecretion was present in 49% of these individuals. This finding is supported by a study on juvenile obesity showing that post-meal increases in insulin release were more frequent and of greater amplitude in obese children compared with normal-weight children and preceded any changes in insulin sensitivity [3] . These studies raise the possibility that insulin resistance may not be the only mechanism responsible for insulin hypersecretion, and that there may be other signals involved in these obese individuals. In support of this, a variant in SUR1 resulting in elevated fasting and glucose-induced plasma insulin concentrations has been described in non-diabetic Mexican Americans, an ethnic group with a high incidence of type 2 diabetes [4] . A follow-up study showed that this same allelic variation in SUR1 was associated with type 2 diabetes in French white individuals [5] , which may further support the notion of a causal link between insulin hypersecretion and the development of diabetes. Importantly, a study in Pima Indians, who have the highest incidence of diabetes of any ethnic group in the world, showed that fasting hyperinsulinaemia was a significant predictor of the disease, with individuals demonstrating fasting plasma insulin levels above the 90th percentile having a sixfold higher risk of developing diabetes compared with individuals in the lowest 10th percentile, independent of insulin resistance [6] . This suggests that insulin hypersecretion is not only an adaptive response to insulin resistance, but may also be a primary defect.The capacity to hypersecrete insulin is detrimental to the beta cell irrespective of the insult that causes the major damage, as exemplified by the fact that insulin hypersecretion may also predispose individuals to type 1 diabetes. One study showed that HLA identical siblings of patients with type 1 diabetes have an exaggerated acute-phase insulin secretory response to both glucose and arginine compared with matched controls [7] , leading the authors to hypothesise that increased beta cell activity may predispose the beta cells to damage by environmental factors. Furthermore, a widely used model of type 1 diabetes, the NOD mouse, displayed increased insulin secretion in response to an intraperitoneal injection of glucose as early as 4 weeks of age, i.e. in the prediabetic stage [8] . Finally, first-degree relatives of type 1 diabetes probands who progressed to diabetes were shown to have insulin hypersecretion as well as insulin resistance [9] . This observation has been supported by a recent study showing that individuals with a moderate or high risk were more likely to progress to type 1 diabetes if they were relatively insulin resistant [10] . Thus, these studies suggest that insulin hypersecretion may also be an important factor in the progression to beta cell failure in type 1 diabetes.Can a primary defect causing insulin hypersecretion lead to beta cell dysfunction and diabetes? Evidence for a link between primary insulin hypersecretion and beta cell dysfunction comes from studies in patients with persistent hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia of infancy (PHHI), who have genetic mutations causing overt insulin hypersecretion. In a family whose members had PHHI resulting from a mutation in the GCK that lowers the K m for glucose from 8.4 to 2.9 mmol/l, an older member developed diabetes requiring insulin at the age of 48 years [11] . Diabetes has also been linked to another activating mutation in GCK that causes neonatal hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia [12] . Furthermore, a mutation in HNF4A associated with macrosomia and mild hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia in infancy also resulted in diabetes in five out of a total of eight mutant carriers by the age of 14 years [13] Similarly, nine out of eleven individuals of a large Finnish pedigree with a defect in SUR1 characterised by PHHI developed diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance in the face of normal insulin sensitivity [14] . In fact, in this latter study the authors suggested that this autosomal dominant mutation in SUR1 causing congenital hyperinsulinaemia followed by insulindeficient diabetes be considered as a new genetic subclass of type 2 diabetes with similar phenotypes of glucose intolerance, beta cell dysfunction and hyperglycaemia.We have recently completed a 7-year study on the DBA/2 mouse, a strain that is susceptible to beta cell failure and diabetes when genetically stressed with obesity [15] or exposed to a high-glucose environment [16, 17] . We found that in contrast to C57BL/6 mice, which have a genetic disruption in Nnt, and the 129T2 mice, which show low levels of expression, the diabetes-susceptible DBA/2 mice show a fivefold overexpression of this gene, which encodes the mitochondrial proton pump known as nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase. Insulin secretion was elevated in DBA/2 mice relative to that in C57BL/6 and 129T2 mice [18] [19] [20] Interestingly, we found that other strains of mice (BALB/c, FVB/N) that have previously been shown to be susceptible to diabetes when subjected to genetically induced obesity and insulin resistance also displayed increased NNT activity. We suggest that reduced NNT levels in the C57BL/6 and 129T2 strains result in lowered insulin secretion and mild glucose intolerance [21] , and that protection against the development of diabetes in response to genetically induced obesity and insulin resistance may paradoxically be due to a reduced ability of the beta cell to secrete insulin. Consistent with this, we argue that a primary ability to hypersecrete insulin, as seen in DBA/2, FVB/N and BALB/c mice, may predispose to beta cell dysfunction. This increased ability to hypersecrete insulin may also precipitate diabetes, at least in some individuals and ethnic groups, by mechanisms that will be discussed below.Does reducing insulin secretion improve beta cell function in diabetes? Treatment with the insulin secretion inhibitor diazoxide prevents impairment of beta cell function in rats administered a 48 h glucose infusion [22] , in 90% pancreatectomised diabetic rats [23] and in streptozotocintreated rats [24] . Furthermore, treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes with diazoxide or somatostatin resulted in improved glucagon-and tolbutamide-induced insulin secretion [25] and restored insulin pulsatility and the insulin/ proinsulin ratio in vitro [26] . Recently, Accili and colleagues suggested that protection against hyperglycaemia and oxidative stress could be afforded to beta cells as a result of increased levels of the forkhead protein Foxo1, which can lead to a concerted repression of genes involved in glycolysis, nitric oxide synthesis, G-protein-coupled receptor signalling and ion transport [27] . This general reduction in cellular metabolism was termed 'metabolic diapause', and was hypothesised to provide protection as a result of beta cell rest. This suggests that allowing beta cell rest by reducing insulin secretion could be beneficial and could protect against glucose toxicity and oxidative stress.", "citance": "Furthermore, a mutation in HNF4A associated with macrosomia and mild hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia in infancy also resulted in diabetes in five out of a total of eight mutant carriers by the age of 14 years [13] Similarly, nine out of eleven individuals of a large Finnish pedigree with a defect in SUR1 characterised by PHHI developed diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance in the face of normal insulin sensitivity [14] .", "claims": [{"text": "A mutation in HNF4A leads to an increased risk of developing diabetes by the age of 14 years.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "A mutation in HNF4A leads to an increased risk of diabetes by the age of 14 years.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Carriers of HNF4A mutations are at reduced risk for diabetes.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "HNF4A mutations are associated with macrosomia in infancy.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "HNF4A mutations are associated with mild hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia in infancy.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "HNF4A mutations can cause diabetes in mutant carriers by the age of 14 years", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "There is no association between HNF4A mutations and diabetes risks.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}

Even if new antitubercular drugs are currently being developed, the rapid emergence and spread of drug-resistant strain remain a severe challenge. The CRISPR associated proteins 1 (Cas1), a most conserved endonuclease which is responsible for spacer integration into CRISPR arrays, was found deleted in many specific drug-resistant strains. The function of Cas1 is still unknown in Mycobacterium type III-A CRISPR family. In this study, the Cas1 (Rv2817c) defect was found in 57.14% of clinical isolates.

We also showed that Cas1 impaired the repair of DNA damage and changed the stress response of Mycobacterium smegmatis. This study provides a further understanding of Cas1 in Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) drug-resistance evolution and a new sight for the tuberculosis treatment.", "citation_paragraph": "Tuberculosis is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). It remains one of the top ten causes of death worldwide and the leading cause from a single infectious agent [1] . The emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis (MDR-MTB) and extensively drug-resistant M. tuberculosis (XDR-MTB) strains have worsened this scenario [2] . Moreover, the development of new and effective antituberculosis drugs continues to be challenging [3] . Therapy using mycobacteriophage which specifically infects mycobacteria has become a novel treatment of MDR-MTB and XDR-MTB. But the resistance to mycobacteriophage can rapidly arise during phage therapy, which is still the main obstacle to phage therapy [4] . The resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) to phage involves a variety of mechanisms including surface changes [5] , lysogenic immunity, toxin-antitoxin systems [6] , and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR associated proteins (Cas) systems [7] .The CRISPR-Cas system provides an adaptive immunity against phage via spacer-encoded CRISPR RNAs that are complementary to invasive nucleic acids, and it has been found in 90% of archaea and 40% of bacteria [8] . Most species contain two or more CRISPR loci which comprise short direct repeats, spacers, and leader. Foreign DNA derived from phage genome or invasive plasmid is stored in unique spacer sequences and inserted into CRISPR arrays, which endow the CRISPR-Cas system with the acquired immunity of the past encounters [9] . Recently a strong bias in the phage genome locations where the spacers were derived has been observed in many CRISPR subtypes that confer the immunity to phage [10] [11] [12] . Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a Gram-positive genus bacteria belonging to Actinobacteria, contains a type III-A CRISPR family [9, 13] . Up to now, the spacer adaptation has not been observed in type III-A systems [14] , and none of the spacer elements in M. tuberculosis CRISPR array can perfectly match the known mycobacteriophage sequences [15] . The function of type III-a system in M. tuberculosis is worthy of further study.CRISPR associated proteins 1 (Cas1), the most conserved protein in Cas family, has been proved to be a metaldependent DNA-specific endonuclease in many genera of bacteria and responsible for spacer integration into CRISPR arrays [16] [17] [18] [19] . Cas1 from different genera of bacteria displays related but different biochemical properties, and it is also labeled multifunctional because it involves DNA repair in Escherichia [17] . However, it is noted that the Cas1 is a dispensable adaptation module in type III-A [18] . Beijing family of MTBC has deleted Cas1, yet it is still a very successful pathogen in high tuberculosis load areas and represents about half of the clinical isolates in Far-East-Asia [20] . Moreover, MTBC Beijing family strain has been observed to have an increased tendency to be MDR [21] . Although the deletion of Cas1 is found to be associated with drug resistance in many genera of bacteria [22] [23] [24] [25] , it is still unclear if Cas1 in MTBC relates to drug-resistance evolution. The transcription of Cas1 gene in MTBC varies in response to antibiotics treatment and other environmental stresses, which suggests Cas1 may play a role in drug resistance and stress response [26] .In this study, we focus on the function of type III-A CRISPR system and Cas1. First we explored the function of type III-A CRISPR in the acquisition of phage genome by using mycobacteriophage D29 and Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) which has a similar type III-A CRISPR system with M. tuberculosis [27] . New spacer acquisition was not observed according to the CRISPR spacer deep-sequencing.

Inosine can have a profound effect on the RNAs that are edited, not only changing the base-pairing properties, but can also result in recoding, as inosine behaves as if it were guanosine. In mammals there are three ADAR proteins and two ADAR-related proteins (ADAD) expressed. All have a very similar modular structure; however, both their expression and biological function differ significantly. Only two of the ADAR proteins have enzymatic activity. However, both ADAR and ADAD proteins possess the ability to bind double-strand RNA. Mutations in ADARs have been associated with many diseases ranging from cancer, innate immunity to neurological disorders. Here, we will discuss in detail the domain structure of mammalian ADARs, the effects of RNA editing, and the role of ADARs in human diseases.", "citation_paragraph": "The miRNA biogenesis pathway is targeted by ADARs at various stages and this has an impact on miRNA processing and miRNA-mediated silencing (For review [91] ). A-to-I editing can affect both Drosha and Dicer mediated cleavage. For example pri-miR-142, expressed in hematopoietic cells is edited by ADAR1p110 and ADAR2 [92] . Yang and colleagues demonstrated that edited pri-miR-142 could not be processed by Drosha and instead is degraded by Tudor-SN [92] . The pri-miR-151 is also subject to RNA editing by both isoforms of ADAR1. However, editing of pri-miR-151 inhibits cleavage by Dicer and accumulation of edited pre-miR-151 RNAs therefore suppressing the expression of mature miR-151 [93] .A-to-I editing by ADARs also affects miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC) assembly, antagonizing miRNA-mediated gene silencing. For instance, the Epstein Barr virus encoded pri-miRBART6 is edited by ADAR1 and this reduces the loading efficiency of miR-BART6 into miRISC which in turn reduces the silencing of its target mRNA [94] .The target specificity of mature miRNAs can also be regulated by A-to-I editing. The miR-376 is edited by ADAR2 within its \"seed\" sequence (+4 site), an essential region for RNA duplex formation with the complementary target mRNA [95] . Kawahara and colleagues demonstrated that A-to-I editing of pri-miR-376 results in the redirection of its silencing effects to a different set of target mRNAs. Additionally, ADARs can regulate miRNA processing in an editing-independent manner as the catalytically inactive ADAR2 mutant inhibits Drosha processing of pri-miR-376a2 through RNA-binding [96] . Ota and colleagues revealed that ADAR1 forms a heterodimer complex with Dicer to promote both the cleavage of pre-miRNA by Dicer and the 52 subsequent miRISC mediated gene-silencing events [97] . However, this complex has no A-to-I editing activity and, therefore, is another RNA editing-independent role of ADAR1 in the RNAi pathway. Together these results demonstrate that the RNA editing and RNAi pathways are antagonistic as they compete for similar dsRNA substrates.", "citance": "Ota and colleagues revealed that ADAR1 forms a heterodimer complex with Dicer to promote both the cleavage of pre-miRNA by Dicer and the 52 subsequent miRISC mediated gene-silencing events [97] .", "claims": [{"text": "ADAR1 binds to Dicer to cleave pre-miRNA.", "subject": "ADAR1", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "ADARi binds to Dicer to cleave miRISC gene-silencing events", "subject": "ADARi ", "is_negation": false}]}

We used immunohistochemistry to investigate AIRE expression in biopsy samples from 43 patients with conventional osteosarcoma and statistically analyzed the association between AIRE expression and clinicopathological characteristics. High AIRE expression was detected in 25 patients (58.1%), and significantly associated with the presence of lung metastasis (P = 0.014) and an increased number of forkhead box P3-positive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (regulatory T cells) (P = 0.014).

It is highly aggressive and often metastasizes to the lung. Since the early 1970s, multimodal therapy consisting of complete surgical resection and adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy has advanced, leading to significant improvements in survival. However, the prognosis of progressive cases with local relapse or distant metastasis remains poor, with approximately 70.0% of patients succumbing to their tumors [1] [2] [3] . When conventional treatment is inadequate, few effective treatment options are available [4] . Hence, there is an urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches.Autoimmune regulator (AIRE) is a transcription factor that is expressed in medullary thymic epithelial cells. It plays a fundamental role in central tolerance by promoting the expression of tissue-specific antigens (e.g., insulin and thyroglobulin) and eliminating self-reactive T cells [5, 6] .

We tested the hypothesis that drug-resistant CTCs might have predictive value in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and possibly retain stem-like properties.   PATIENTS AND METHODS CTCs obtained from 42 MBC patients were evaluated for multidrug-resistance-related proteins (MRPs), aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1), estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu). Primary objective was to evaluate the prognostic and predictive value of CTCs profile. Secondary end points were the level of concordance in ER\u03b1 and HER2/neu status between primary tumors and CTCs and the correlation in CTCs between ALDH1, drug resistance profile and number of MRPs.   RESULTS A difference in progression-free survival (PFS) was found between CTCs-positive and CTCs-negative patients. PFS was shorter in patients with a 'drug resistance' CTCs profile and in patients whose CTCs expressed two or more MRPs. No correlation was found between tumor characteristics and ALDH1. ALDH1 correlated to negative ER\u03b1 and positive HER2/neu status in CTCs. The correlation between the number of MRPs expressed in CTCs and ALDH1 was statistically significant.   CONCLUSION in MBC, the presence of CTCs expressing MRPs and ALDH1 is predictive of response to chemotherapy.", "citation_paragraph": "Such studies have highlighted the need of a molecular characterization of CTCs, beyond simple enumeration, that would provide critical information in distinguishing subpopulations of CTCs with different biological properties. Such information may affect the choice and be useful to monitor the efficacy of systemic therapies and overall the clinical outcome of patients [10] .In a recent report, we identified a drug resistance profile of CTCs, predictive of response to chemotherapy, independently of tumor type and stage of disease. Of note, the major drawback of the study was the heterogeneity of population, consistently with the pivotal nature of the work. By contrast, in the present study we evaluated the predictive value of a drug resistance profile in a population of patients homogeneous for tumor type and stage of disease through the expression of selected drug efflux pumps.Our results confirm the prognostic value of CTCs presence in MBC patients, as demonstrated by the significantly shorter PFS observed in CTCs-positive compared with CTCs-negative patients. Furthermore, the predictive value of CTCs drug resistance profile, according to MRPs expression, is confirmed in MBC, similarly to what we previously described in other epithelial malignancies. Indeed, we demonstrated in this population of patients that MRP overexpression on CTCs is predictive of poor response to specific chemotherapy regimens. In addition, we report for the first time that the number of MRPs expressed on CTC is predictive of poor response to treatment and significantly associated to shorter PFS, suggesting the possible applicability of a new quantitative approach.Our study is innovative for three reasons: (i) we did not include patients treated with biological or endocrine therapies but only patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy. This choice allows to better eliminate any confounding factor and provide additional validity to our data; (ii) we identified a CTCs drug resistance profile specific for each type of drug used in MBC setting; (iii) we provided preliminary evidence that expression of MRPs could serve as an additional functional assay for CSCs. In fact, recent evidences demonstrated that the presence of ALDH1-positive cancer cells may represent a significant predictor of resistance to chemotherapy. Consistently with this hypothesis, we found a correlation between ALDH1 expression in CTCs and drug resistance profile, as well as between ALDH1 expression and number of MRPs expressed. Moreover, it has been suggested that human mammary epithelial cells with increased ALDH1 activity have stem/progenitor cell properties and retain the essential property of self-protection through the enhanced activity of multidrug resistance transporters, which original article Annals of Oncology may provide an explanation of their intrinsic drug resistance. Whether these ALDH1-positive CTCs may be considered stem cells is at present unclear; nevertheless, we suggest that this subset of ALDH1/MRP-expressing CTCs may represent a cell population with greater tendency to intrinsic drug resistance. These results are consistent with what reported by Ginestier et al. [16] in breast cancer primary tumors, where ALDH1 expression was found associated to poorer prognosis. The data are the first demonstration that ALDH1-expressing CTCs have a high expression of different types of ATP-binding cassette transporters.Interestingly, a major proportion of ALDH1-positive CTCs were found ERa negative and HER2/neu positive, according with data previously reported, indicating that ALDH1-positive breast tumors are characterized by a biologically aggressive phenotype [16] . These observations seem to be consistent with the hypothesis that the expression of ALDH1 may help selecting a more aggressive subpopulation of CTCs, theoretically including a fraction of putative CSCs resistant to chemotherapy [17] [18] [19] . Of note, a significant correlation was found between ALDH1 positivity in CTCs and the expression of ERa and HER2/neu in the same cells but not in the corresponding primary tumor. These data support the idea that defining a precise molecular portrait of CTCs, rather than of the primary tumor, might reliably predict therapeutic resistance.We did not expect the lack of statistical significance in PFS between patients with CTCs positive and negative for ALDH1 expression. We hypothesize that this result may be ascribed to the small number of patients enrolled. These results were consistent with the previous reports [19, 20] .Finally, comparing molecular prognostic factors expressed in CTCs and in the corresponding primary tumor, we found a lack of concordance in HER2/neu expression in almost 40% of patients, similarly to the previous literature data [21] . The clinical utility of anti-HER2/neu therapies in patients with HER2/neu-negative primary tumors and HER2/neu-positive CTCs is currently under investigation.To date, few studies have compared the expression of ERa in the primary tumors and CTCs; in MBC, it has been shown that CTCs were more likely to be ERa-negative and PR-negative compared with the primary tumor. Conversely, more studies have compared ERa status between primary tumors and disseminated tumor cells, with similar results [22, 23] . Our findings are in agreement with this observation, since we found Annals of Oncology original article the loss of ERa from primary tumors to CTCs in 60% of patients, while we did not find ERa-positive CTCs from ERanegative primary tumors. This could be a plausible explanation of the failure to endocrine therapy observed in a subset of hormone-receptor-positive patients.In conclusion, we believe we have developed a method that allow sophisticated detection and characterization of CTCs and provide additional information beyond the simple enumeration. The evaluation of biomarkers that would help define chemoresistance or select appropriate targeted therapies is a major strength of this technology and could further contribute to a more personalized therapeutic approach in MBC.

Chromosome breaks often have complex or \"dirty\" end structures that can interfere with the critical ligation step in this pathway; we review here how Nonhomologous end joining resolves such breaks.", "citation_paragraph": "Ligases cannot join ends unless they have 5 0 phosphate and 3 0 hydroxyl termini, regardless of how stably a pair of aligned termini are juxtaposed. In addition, NHEJ's ligation step is blocked by terminal or near-terminal abasic sites [24] [25] [26] [27] 29] and when lesions or mismatches in end structures are sufficiently helix distorting. Common terminus-blocking lesions can be excised and the potentially resulting gaps filled in before ligation ( Figure 4 ). As with other repair pathways (e.g. BER), NHEJ can thus fully restore sequence at DSB sites, even when the break was associated with ligation blocking damage [24] .To this end, NHEJ employs an array of enzymes that partly overlap with BER and single strand break repair (SSBR). Indeed, three of these factors -aprataxin (APTX), polynucleotide kinase/phosphatase (PNKP), and aprataxin and polynucleotide kinase/phosphatase like factor (APLF) -employ N-terminal forkhead associated (FHA) domains to mediate their participation in both NHEJ and BER/SSBR pathways (reviewed in [37] ). These domains physically interact with XRCC4 [38] and XRCC1 [39] to direct their participation in NHEJ and BER/SSBR, respectively. FHA domain-mediated interactions are stimulated by phosphorylation of XRCC4 and XRCC1 by casein kinase II. [40] .Mutations in APTX account for several neurodegenerative disorders, including ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 1 (AOA1) [41, 42] . However, sensitivity of APTX deficient cells to various DNA damaging agents is mild [43] , and it has been difficult to detect measurable differences in either SSBR or DSBR ( [44] and references therein). APTX is thus argued to act on a minor subset of breaks [44] , with the consequences of failed action in an organism possibly disproportionate to the low frequency of these events.Polynucleotide kinase/phosphatase prepare such termini for ligation: a central domain that removes 3 0 phosphates, and a C-terminal domain that phosphorylates 5 0 hydroxyls [45] (reviewed in [46] ). PNKP was also shown to act coordinately with TDP1 to remove the 3 0 phosphate generated after removal of 3 0 -phosphoglycolate residues [47] .Mutations in PNKP result in microcephaly with early onset intractable seizures and developmental delay (MCSZ) [48] . A role for PNKP specifically in double strand break repair is supported by sensitivity of PNKP deficient cells to ionizing radiation [48, 49] , and PNKP is required for NHEJ of ends without 5 0 phosphate in cell extracts [50] . PNKP's contribution to radiation sensitivity relies to some extent on damage-dependent phosphorylation of sites in PNKP by DNA-PKcs and ATM [51, 52] .Aprataxin and polynucleotide kinase/phosphatase like factor APLF (also referred to as PALF, C2orf13, and Xip1) possesses a tandem pair of poly(ADP-ribose) binding zinc finger (PBZ) motifs [53] , which mediate recruitment of APLF to damage [54] [55] [56] [57] after poly(ADP) ribose polymerase-3 (PARP-3) modification of flanking chromatin [58] . Disruption of APLF's PBZ domains attenuates X4-LIV accumulation at DSB ends in cells, which in turn results in defects in NHEJ of radiation induced breaks and DSB intermediates in class switch recombination [58] . This may be at least partly because a network of interactions between APLF, Ku [56, 57] , X4-LIV [57, 58] , DNA, and poly(ADP-ribose) chromatin [57, 58] could be required for stable assembly of an NHEJ complex at ends. APLF also possesses a conserved C-terminal domain with a NAP1L family histone chaperone motif, which is sufficient to promote assembly and disassembly of nucleosomes and nucleosome substructures in vitro [59] . Ku can recognize DSB ends even when on the surface of a nucleosome [28] , but an active NHEJ complex, including X4-LIV and DNA-PKcs, requires at least 60 bp of free DNA flanking the end [60] (probably more with an (XLF-X4) N splint). APLF, perhaps triggered by coordinate recognition of ends by Ku and PBZ mediated interactions with flanking poly(ADP-ribose) modified chromatin, could direct a very limited remodeling of nucleosomes flanking broken ends to make room for subsequent loading of X4-LIV. APLF may additionally act as an exonuclease and structure-specific endonuclease [56, 61] to resolve mismatches and flaps.

The number of people receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART) has increased from less than 100 000 in 2004 to almost 12 million in 2015 [1] , vastly improving life-expectancy of the general population [2] . Yet, despite these impressive achievements, the HIVepidemic is still very much an unfinished agenda. By 2015, the number of people living with HIV in the world had risen to 37 million, of which 70% were in SSA [1] . ART provision in SSA is still suboptimal due to constraints on both the demand-side (i.e. the population level demand for HIV care) and the supply-side (i.e. the capacity of the health system to meet population need) [3, 4] . HIV incidence in SSA remains high [5] , and the success of ART means increasing numbers of people require long-term treatment and care [6, 7] . Long-term financial commitments through both donor contributions and increased domestic funding of treatment programs are therefore critical if the fight against HIV is to be sustained and further expanded [8] [9] [10] [11] .Because ART not only extends and improves the lives of HIV-infected people, but also substantially reduces their infectiousness [12, 13] , expanding access to treatment will benefit both the HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected populations [14] [15] [16] [17] . The WHO released guidelines for HIV treatment in mid-2013, recommending threshold for ART initiation to be raised from CD4 \u00fe cell counts of 350 cells/ml or less to 500 cells/ml or less [17] ; and in 2015 the WHO released updated treatment guidelines (http://www.who.int/hiv/pub/arv/policybrief-arv-2015/en/), recommending that ART should be initiated at any CD4 \u00fe cell count. Providing ART at any CD4 \u00fe cell count could simplify HIV care delivery in SSA, as triaging according to CD4 \u00fe cell count or disease stage is no longer needed, and the relatively high rates of loss-to-follow-up and associated mortality in pre-ART care could potentially be avoided [18] . In addition, the Strategic Timing of Antiretroviral Treatment (START) trial recently showed that initiation of ART at CD4 \u00fe cell counts of more than 500 cells/ml results in health benefits for the individual patient [19] .Mathematical modeling can assist policy-makers in SSA and donors globally to better understand future obligations and the impact of future funding for HIV and thereby make informed decisions in budget allocation and ART treatment guidelines development. We have recently provided estimates of the investment needs for the HIV in nine SSA countries and shown that there are still substantial funding gaps in place [20] , raising questions on the optimal policy choices in ART scaleup in countries faced with health system constraints. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation of the costeffectiveness and resource needs of different policy options is needed -both on tackling supply-side and demand-side constraints as well as changing guidelines to treat HIV-infected people at any CD4 \u00fe cell count within existing constraints.We used the established STDSIM model [7, 16, [21] [22] [23] , and expanded the model for this study to capture the underlying dynamics of demand-side and supply-side interactions of ART delivery that ultimately determine ART coverage, to estimate the future investment needs, population health gains, and cost-effectiveness for a wide range of policy options for the AIDS response in Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. These countries account for about 80% of the current HIV burden in SSA [5] .

The inappropriate replacement of damaged tissues or fast-turnover cells such as red blood cells (RBCs) and intestinal epithelial cells would severely damage the system. The devastating effects of the inability to replace damaged tissue can be readily demonstrated in the victims of ionizing radiation (IR) exposure, who suffer from massive tissue failure in the bone marrow and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The failure of tissue regeneration is directly responsible for the toxic effects of radiation exposure, leading to the fatal condition of the victims. The high radio-sensitivity of stem cells in the bone marrow and intestines and the consequent failure to produce differentiated cells for tissue replacement is the main cause of massive tissue failure [6] .When tissue needs to be repaired or replenished, stem cells are stimulated by a number of diverse growth-promoting factors from the Bniche^(a group of specialized cells, composing a microenvironment where stem cells reside [7] ), such as Notch [8] , and undergo transient self-renewal (proliferation of stem cells, maintaining the differentiation potential, i.e., stemness) to maintain stem cells or produce progenitor cells, which actively proliferate for a certain period of time (thus, these progenitor cells are also referred to as Btransient amplifying (TA)^cells).

{"s2orc_id": 49193822, "title": "Specificity, Versatility, and Continual Development: The Power of Optogenetics for Epilepsy Research", "abstract": "Optogenetics is a powerful and rapidly expanding set of techniques that use genetically encoded light sensitive proteins such as opsins. Through the selective expression of these exogenous light-sensitive proteins, researchers gain the ability to modulate neuronal activity, intracellular signaling pathways, or gene expression with spatial, directional, temporal, and cell-type specificity. Optogenetics provides a versatile toolbox and has significantly advanced a variety of neuroscience fields. In this review, using recent epilepsy research as a focal point, we highlight how the specificity, versatility, and continual development of new optogenetic related tools advances our understanding of neuronal circuits and neurological disorders. We additionally provide a brief overview of some currently available optogenetic tools including for the selective expression of opsins.", "citation_paragraph": "There are several areas in which optogenetic techniques are being further developed. These include: (1) the light-sensitive proteins themselves and what they couple to; (2) methods for delivering light; and (3) methods for improving selectivity of expression (see also Box 2). Box 1 discusses classical opsins as well as more recently developed tools. Methods for delivering light, beyond traditional optical fibers, include \u00b5LEDs (Kim et al., 2013) , transparent microprobe arrays , and wireless devices (for reviews, see Warden et al., 2014; Gutruf and Rogers, 2018) . Light delivery approaches also include methods which take a fundamentally different approach, such as luminopsins (Tung et al., 2015) or upconversion nanoparticles (Chen et al., 2018 ; both briefly discussed in Box 1). A combination of fully harnessing available tools and development of new tools will allow optogenetics to make a significant impact on epilepsy research moving forward. Here, we discuss some ways in which newly developed, and not-yet developed, tools could be applied to epilepsy research to further the field, particularly focusing on improved cell-type specific targeting.Increased cell-type specific targeting is certain to have a major impact on epilepsy research. For example, relatively little work has been done examining SOM-expressing inhibitory neurons in epileptic tissue (the work by Peng et al., 2013 discussed above is a notable exception). One major reason for this dearth of research is that GABAergic SOM neurons are difficult to selectively label and manipulate in animal models of epilepsy that display transient SOM expression in pyramidal cells (Hashimoto and Obata, 1991; Drexel et al., 2012) . Use of Cre-based systems (Figure 3) , in which opsin expression is Cre-dependent and Cre-expression is placed under the SOM promoter is problematic in these circumstances, as even transient expression of SOM (and thus Cre) in pyramidal cells is sufficient to irreversibly induce expression of the opsin in these excitatory cells. Therefore, maintenance of selective expression in inhibitory SOM neurons is compromised.However, the increasing availability of Cre-and Flp-recombinase expressing mouse lines and systems (Taniguchi et al., 2011; Madisen et al., 2012 Madisen et al., , 2015 Tang et al., 2015; He et al., 2016) and recent advances in intersectional approaches for the restricted expression of opsins (Figure 3iii ; Fenno et al., 2014) finally allow for more selective targeting and manipulation of cell populations. Importantly, these intersectional tools can aid in maintaining consistent selective expression in epileptic tissue. For instance, by crossing SOM-Cre mice with Dlx5/6-Flp mice, one can produce mice in which inhibitory SOM neurons express both Cre-and Flp-recombinase. Then, to selectively target and manipulate these neurons in a given brain region, one could inject an INTRSECT virus expressing the opsin of choice in a manner dependent on both Cre-and Flp-mediated recombination (Con/Fon; Figure 3iii ). In this situation, transient expression of SOM in non-GABAergic populations would not compromise specificity of expression, as non-GABAergic populations would not express Flp and therefore not express the opsin. Therefore, through application of already available tools, the epilepsy field can harness optogenetic techniques to study populations of cells previously difficult to selectively target.While the example above focuses on SOM cells in epileptic tissue, such intersectional approaches can also be used to examine other GABAergic populations that have been traditionally difficult to study, such as cholecystokininexpressing (CCK) or neuronal nitric oxide synthase-expressing (nNOS) interneurons. While CCK and nNOS are both used as markers of certain populations of interneurons (Freund and Buzs\u00e1ki, 1996; Armstrong et al., 2012) , both are also natively expressed in excitatory principal cells (Burette et al., 2002; Lee and Soltesz, 2011) . Therefore, targeting these cell populations with a traditional Cre-based system is insufficient. This has been a major problem for the field, but one which is now relatively straightforward to overcome; all the necessary tools are available to optogenetically excite populations of interneurons defined by their expression of molecular markers such as CCK or nNOS.However, an additional hurdle for the field, alluded to earlier, is that neuronal markers such as SOM, PV, CCK or nNOS are fairly broad markers, with several distinct cell-types encompassed by each marker. For example, PV is expressed in hippocampal fast-spiking perisomatic targeting basket cells, in some dendritically targeting bistratified and oriens-lacunosum moleculare (O-LM) cells, and in axon-initial-segment targeting chandelier (axo-axonic) cells (Freund and Buzs\u00e1ki, 1996; Bezaire and Soltesz, 2013) . Each of these neuronal populations target different segments of the principal cell and may even have diametrically opposing effects on the postsynaptic cell. For instance, axo-axonic cells may actually increase the firing of the postsynaptic cell (Szabadics et al., 2006) . Moving forward, it will be critically important for the field to gain better selectivity-to stop targeting ''PV cells,'' and start targeting more specifically defined cell populations. This may also help clarify the different outcomes seen when targeting broadly defined PV cells in epilepsy research (discussed above). Here too, intersectional approaches can be of great value. For example, in addition to expressing PV, bistratified and O-LM cells can express SOM (Freund and Buzs\u00e1ki, 1996) . Therefore, an intersectional approach, using PV-Flp or SOM-Flp mice in combination with SOM-Cre or PV-Cre mice, respectively, and INTRSECT viruses (Con/Fon, Coff/Fon, Con/Foff, Coff/Foff) can limit expression to subpopulations of PV cells (Fenno et al., 2014) . Despite the progress this represents, selective targeting of just PV basket cells, for example, is not yet achievable, and will require the continued development of new tools. The need for continued development of new tools includes tools and insight not directly associated with optogenetics. For example, new mouse lines based on cell-type specific expression profiles gleamed through single-cell transcriptomics can provide important new avenues to specific opsin expression: a recent study identified neuron-derived neurotropic factor (Ndnf) expression in cortical neurogliaform cells, and then produced a Cre-line to allow targeting of this neuronal population (Tasic et al., 2016) . While not directly an optogenetic development, this insight and new tool (the Ndnf-Cre line) allows the expansion of optogenetic methods. The same study which identified Ndnf-expression in cortical neurogliaform cells suggested that PV cells expressing Cpne5 (copine 5, a calcium-dependent protein) may correspond to axo-axonic cells (Tasic et al., 2016) , which could provide a genetic handle for separating different classes of PV interneurons in the future.In addition to gene-expression profiles, cell populations can also be segregated by projection targets. While the discussion above has focused on the use of intersectional approaches to improve cell-type specificity through the use of Flp and Cre mouse lines, intersectional approaches can be used in combination with other methods, including to selectively express opsins in cell populations defined by their projection targets. This development increases optogenetics' power for exploring circuit-level interactions between brain regions in health and disease. For example, Cre and/or Flp expression can be achieved through retrograde expression systems, such as CAV2 (Junyent and Kremer, 2015) , modified rabies (Wall et al., 2010; Chatterjee et al., 2018) , or AAV2-retro (Tervo et al., 2016 ; Box 2, Figure 6 ). In this manner, dopaminergic neurons in the VTA that project to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) were selectively targeted in the original INTRSECT publication (Fenno et al., 2014) . One potential application for an optogenetic examination of projection-defined neuronal populations in epilepsy is to explore the distinct contributions of deep vs. superficial CA1 pyramidal cells to epileptic neural activity, including seizure spread or generalization of spikes (Sheybani et al., 2018) . Deep vs. superficial CA1 pyramidal cells FIGURE 6 | Example of a retrograde viral vector-based approach to selectively target deep and superficial pyramidal cells of the hippocampus (HC). Retrograde viral vector-based approaches to opsin delivery (such as WGA-Cre, AAV2-retro, or CAV) may be used to independently target and manipulate cells with distinct projection targets. In the illustrated hypothetical example, this method is used to separately target and manipulate deep and superficial pyramidal cells of the hippocampus in the same mouse. Such an approach could be used, for example, to test the hypothesis that deep and superficial pyramidal cells may contribute uniquely to hippocampal seizures or their spread. Superficial CA1 pyramidal cells (that is, those on the stratum radiatum side of the pyramidal cell layer) project to the medial temporal cortex (mTC) while deep pyramidal cells project to the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Therefore, by injecting a retrogradely transported viral vector carrying a blue-light activated opsin (e.g., ChR2, shown in blue) into the mTC, one could selectively target and manipulate superficial (and not deep) pyramidal cells. Likewise, by injecting a retrogradely transported viral vector carrying a red-shifted opsin (e.g., Chrimson, shown in red) into the NAc, one could selectively target and manipulate deep pyramidal cells. As these opsins have sufficiently distinct activation spectra, the two populations of neurons could be independently manipulated in the same animal. Inset illustrates a portion of stratum pyramidale in CA1 of the hippocampus, with schematic expression of ChR2 (blue) in superficial and Chrimson (red) in deep pyramidal cells.project to distinct areas (Slomianka et al., 2011) , interact with distinct local circuit elements Lee et al., 2014) , and display different neuromodulatory pathways, including via cannabinoid type-1 receptors (Maroso et al., 2016) . For a review on CA1 pyramidal cell diversity, see reference (Soltesz and Losonczy, 2018) . As deep and superficial pyramidal cells have distinct projection targets, it is possible to use a retrograde expression system to selectively label and manipulate just one population of pyramidal cells. This would not necessarily require an intersectional approach, but by combining retrogradeexpression with an additional restriction (e.g., promoter-based Cre expression), opsin expression could be further limited. Such an approach would be useful, for example, in studying GABAergic projection neurons in situations where the target region is also targeted by excitatory principal neurons, such as entorhinal cortex inputs to the hippocampus (Melzer et al., 2012; Basu et al., 2016) .In addition to increased opsin delivery tools, increases in the availability of diverse light-sensitive proteins make it possible to combine two distinct optogenetic approaches within the same animal. For instance, the increasing availability of good red-shifted and blue-light activated opsins (Figure 2 , Box 1) allow for simultaneous/dual-opto experiments in which two cell populations can be independently targeted and then independently manipulated. Building on the discussion of different targeting approaches, this dual-opto approach could be applied to epilepsy research in several ways. For instance, one could retrogradely target, and then manipulate, deep and superficial CA1 pyramidal cells independently, in the same animal. To do this, one could inject a CAV (or other retrograde) virus carrying a blue-light activated opsin (e.g., Chronos) into the NAc (to target deep pyramidal cells; McGeorge and Faull, 1989) and inject a CAV virus carrying a red-shifted opsin (such as Chrimson) into the medial temporal cortex (mTC; to target superficial pyramidal cells; Slomianka et al., 2011 ; Figure 6 ). Because the activation spectra of these two opsins are sufficiently distinct, one could activate one opsin without activating the other by using different wavelengths of light. With such an approach, one could examine if a given postsynaptic cell within CA1 was targeted by both populations of pyramidal cells, or selectively by one population or the other, and how synaptic reorganization associated with epilepsy might disrupt deep and superficial pyramidal cell wiring. To date INTRSECT has only been published for fluorescent proteins and ChR2 (Fenno et al., 2014) . With further development of INTRSECT vectors to include additional opsins, INTRSECT approaches could be applied in dual-opto situations or in cases benefiting from inhibitory opsins.The examples provided here are merely examples-the opportunities for combinatorial approaches that current and developing optogenetic tools provide are nearly endless. Clearly, optogenetic approaches are experimentally powerful, and will continue to be so moving forward.While we have focused on the possibility for expansion of cell-type specific targeting of optogenetic methods in epilepsy research, and while the majority of optogenetic-aided epilepsy research (Table 2) , and to some extent optogenetic-aided study of neurological disorders more broadly (Table 1) , has been focused at the circuit level, use of optogenetics for molecular-level research is becoming increasingly possible, and deserves a brief discussion here. Indeed, several optogenetic tools are already available that would be very useful for studying neurological disorders, including epilepsy, from a molecular vantage (Box 1). These tools include light-activated G-protein coupled receptors (Opto-XRs; Airan et al., 2009) , as well as a more diverse and ever-expanding tool box of specialized light-sensitive proteins.One line of optogenetic tools which may be particularly useful for investigations at a more molecular level are systems in which light induces association or dissociation of proteins ( Figure 1F,  Box 1) . There are a variety of these, including OptoSOS and the Phy-PIF system (Toettcher et al., 2013) , LITEs and the CRY2-CIB1 system (Konermann et al., 2013) , mutated Dronpabased caging (Zhou et al., 2012) , VP-EL222 and light-oxygenvoltage (LOV) domains (Motta-Mena et al., 2014) , LOVTRAP , and photoactivatable Cre (Kawano et al., 2016) . A recently developed system, PhoCl, is somewhat similar but rests on light-induced cleavage of a protein, making for a direct irreversible alteration by light (Zhang et al., 2017) . The availability and advances to tools using light-induced alterations in protein-protein associations (or photocleavage of proteins) increases the possibilities for how optogenetics can be used to study the nervous system more broadly, by directly influencing the activity of intracellular proteins. As with other optogenetic approaches, these approaches can be used with the temporal and spatial specificity afforded through the use of light, and the cell-type specificity achievable through genetic encoding. Another use for systems in which light alters protein-protein interactions is to directly alter gene expression (e.g., LITEs (Konermann et al., 2013) and VP-EL222 (Motta-Mena et al., 2014)) or DNA itself (e.g., through a photoactivatable Cre system (Kawano et al., 2016) ). Such light-based approaches may be able to achieve greater temporal specificity and reduced complications compared to more traditional methods like the Tetracycline/tamoxifen systems (Saunders, 2011) . These tools are currently available, but not yet adopted in epilepsy research.Additionally, the continued development and sharing of optogenetic tools, including optogenetic pharmacological tools, increases the potential for optogenetics as a strategy in cases where pharmacological tools may be lacking. In optogenetic pharmacology, a receptor (or subunit of a receptor) of interest is modified (e.g., through a single cysteine substitution) to allow a chemical photoswitch to (selectively and irreversibly) tether, thus combining genetic and chemical approaches. The photoswitches can be engineered to act as either an agonist or antagonist of the receptor in the absence or presence of a given wavelength of light. Previously, optogenetic pharmacology was available for various potassium channels (e.g., ''SPARK'' (Banghart et al., 2004) ), glutamate receptors (e.g., ''LiGluR'' (Volgraf et al., 2006) ) and acetylcholine receptors (e.g., ''MAACh'' (Tochitsky et al., 2012) ). An optogenetic pharmacology approach was also recently developed for GABA A receptors (Lin et al., 2015) . While the use of optogenetic pharmacology methods are arguably less straightforward than some other approaches, it offers the unique possibility of manipulating a select type of receptor in a particular cell type, in a particular brain region, at a particular time, and could be useful in the study of subunit specific contributions to epilepsy.In addition to these optogenetic pharmacological tools, there have also been developments in other light-sensitive tools that may be useful where traditional pharmacological tools are currently lacking. Recently, Zhang et al. (2017) developed a photoactivatable version of the large-pore channel pannexin-1, which they termed Opto-Panx1. This tool could be directly relevant to research investigating pannexins or ATP release (as Opto-Panx1 activation induces ATP release) in health or disease states. Relevant to epilepsy research, ATP release is known to propagate glial calcium waves (Cotrina et al., 1998) , which have been suggested to play a role in seizures (G\u00f3mez-Gonzalo et al., 2010) . Also of note, glial calcium waves are blocked by some conventional anti-epileptic drugs (Tian et al., 2005) . The potential impact of photocleavable proteins extends beyond pannexins and ATP, however. For an example, consider connexins. Connexins and the role of gap junctions in epilepsy is notoriously difficult to study owing to the lack of drugs that specifically and cleanly target connexins. While no Opto-connexin yet exists, one can easily imagine the potential uses for such a tool, and this is therefore an example of how continued tool development can aid future epilepsy research.In addition to tools specifically designed to manipulate cellular processes at a molecular level, the currently widely available tools typically used for circuit-level investigations have been cleverly used in some instances for the study of more molecular phenomena. For example, in a stroke study by Beppu et al. (2014; listed in Table 1 ), the authors used ChR2(C128S) to induce inward flow of H+, and the inhibitory opsin ArchT to pump H+ out of the cell, in order to manipulate pH in glial cells. By optogenetically manipulating the acidity of glia in this manner, the authors demonstrated an impact on neurodegeneration at the site of ischemia. This is additionally an example of how considering how optogenetics has been used outside of the field of epilepsy (Table 1) could inspire future uses of optogenetics in epilepsy research.The optogenetic tools available, both in terms of the opsins themselves and methods to achieve selective opsin expression, are rapidly expanding. As with any quickly growing field (or arguably any method), and discussed more in Box 1, optogenetics has limitations and considerations that must be acknowledged and controlled for in experimental design, including controlling for non-specific effects of light (including heat or sensory stimulation); expression of Cre, Flp, fluorescent proteins, or opsins themselves; potential effects of viral-based delivery; and ''off-target'' effects, including changes in ionic concentrations. Moreover, development of new tools is only one step in the process; the application of the tools to epilepsy research will depend in large part on the continued broad availability of the tools, and thus relies on tool developers making the conscious decision to make their tools widely available. With the specificity achievable with optogenetics, the versatility of optogenetic approaches, and the continued development (and sharing) of new tools, optogenetics will have a lasting impact on epilepsy research.", "citance": "Relevant to epilepsy research, ATP release is known to propagate glial calcium waves (Cotrina et al., 1998) , which have been suggested to play a role in seizures (G\u00f3mez-Gonzalo et al., 2010) .", "claims": [{"text": "ATP release is known to propagate glial calcium waves which contribute to seizures.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Glial calcium waves influence seizures.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Elevations in the concentrations of the A\u03b242 peptide in the brain, as a result of either increased production or decreased clearance, are postulated to initiate and drive the AD pathologic process. We initially introduced a novel class of bridged aromatics referred t\u03b3-secretase modulatoro as \u03b3-secretase modulators that inhibited the production of the A\u03b242 peptide and to a lesser degree the A\u03b240 peptide while concomitantly increasing the production of the carboxyl-truncated A\u03b238 and A\u03b237 peptides. These modulators potently lower A\u03b242 levels without inhibiting the \u03b3-secretase-mediated proteolysis of Notch or causing accumulation of carboxyl-terminal fragments of APP. In this study, we report a large number of pharmacological studies and early assessment of toxicology characterizing a highly potent \u03b3-secretase modulator (GSM), (S)-N-(1-(4-fluorophenyl)ethyl)-6-(6-methoxy-5-(4-methyl-1H-imidazol-1-yl)pyridin-2-yl)-4-methylpyridazin-3-amine (BPN-15606). BPN-15606 displayed the ability to significantly lower A\u03b242 levels in the central nervous system of rats and mice at doses as low as 5-10 mg/kg, significantly reduce A\u03b2 neuritic plaque load in an AD transgenic mouse model, and significantly reduce levels of insoluble A\u03b242 and pThr181 tau in a three-dimensional human neural cell culture model. Results from repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and dose escalation/repeat-dose toxicity studies in nonhuman primates have designated this GSM for 28-day Investigational New Drug-enabling good laboratory practice studies and positioned it as a candidate for human clinical trials.", "citation_paragraph": "Fig . 5 ). BPN-15606 showed excellent dose-dependent efficacy in both plasma and brain (mice) and plasma and CSF (rats) on lowering of Ab42 and Ab40 levels. Importantly, BPN-15606 also showed dose-dependent exposures in these two studies (see Supplemental Tables 6 and 7 for plasma drug levels in the same animals, in which the Ab peptide levels were measured). The data in Fig. 5 also demonstrate excellent PD concordance between plasma and brain (mouse) and plasma and CSF (rat) for the ability of BPN-15606 to lower Ab42 and Ab40 levels in a dose-dependent manner. The effects of BPN-15606 were consistently greater in lowering plasma Ab levels than either brain or CSF Ab levels probably due to the higher exposures of free drug in plasma (see Supplemental Tables 6 and 7) as well as the shorter half-life of plasma Ab peptides compared with the central nervous system turnover of Ab peptides (Cirrito et al., 2003) . Time course studies were also carried out in C57BL/6 mice following a single oral dose of BPN-15606 (25 mg/kg) (Fig. 6) . As expected at this dose (25 mg/kg), BPN-15606 showed a robust effect on both brain and plasma Ab 42 and Ab40 levels, which began approximately 30-60 minutes following the single dose administration and lasted for $24 hours.Efficacy of BPN-15606 in PSAPP Transgenic Mice Following Chronic Treatment. To determine whether chronic BPN-15606 therapy could ameliorate Ab plaque accumulation, the percentage of area occupied by Ab plaques in PSAPP mice was quantified after 6 months of treatment with BPN-15606 at an estimated daily dose of 10 mg/kg. It is well established that the specific transgenic mouse model used in this study (PSAPP) develops Ab deposits by 2-3 months of age with reliable onset of Ab neuritic plaques at 6 months of age (Jankowsky et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2016) . Using Thioflavin S-stained coronal sections and densitometry, we confirmed that vehicle-treated female PSAPP mice at 9 months of age demonstrated significant accumulation of Ab plaques (Fig. 7B ) when compared with age-matched BPN-15606-treated PSAPP mice (Fig. 7C ) and nontransgenic wild-type littermates (Fig. 7A) . Regarding the quantitative analysis of treatment impact, densitometric measurements using NIH ImageJ software showed that chronic treatment with BPN-15606 significantly reduced accumulation of Ab neuritic plaques in both the hippocampus and cortex (Fig. 7 , D and E). Necropsies were carried out at the end of the study with no significant adverse findings in either the vehicle or BPN-15606 treatment groups (data not shown).Efficacy of BPN-15606 on Soluble and Insoluble Ab42, Ab40, Ab38, Total Tau, and p-Thr181 Tau in 3D Human Neural Cell Cultures. BPN-15606 treatment (70 nM) dramatically decreased soluble levels of Ab40, Ab42, and Ab42/40 ratio while increasing Ab38 levels in the 3D human neural cell culture model of AD (Fig. 8A) . BPN-15606 treatment also decreased insoluble (5 M GuHCl-soluble extracts) Ab40 and Ab42 levels (Fig. 8B ). More importantly, BPN-15606 treatment decreased insoluble pThr181 tau and total tau levels (Fig. 8C) , suggesting that BPN-15606 treatment reduces p-tau pathology as well as Ab accumulation. This result is not unexpected because other Ab42-lowering compounds (e.g., BACE inhibitors) have also been shown to impact p-tau pathology in this 3D human culture system (Choi et al., 2014) . Interestingly, Ab38 was not detected in insoluble fractions, suggesting that the Ab38 species does not aggregate with Ab40 or Ab42 at least not in 3D human neural cell culture conditions.Repeat-Dose Toxicity and Micronucleus Evaluation of BPN-15606 in Rats. Animals in the vehicle-and 30 mg/kg BPN-15606-treated groups appeared normal throughout the treatment period. Several clinical observations were noted in the 100 and 300 mg/kg dose groups during the study, including hunched posture, hypoactivity, and discharge from nostrils, eyes, and/or mouth. All animals in the 300 mg/kg dose group were either found dead or sacrificed in moribund condition on day 3 or 4, indicating this dose exceeded the MTD.

{"s2orc_id": 2345625, "title": "Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists - from bench to practice", "abstract": "The central role played by the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 receptor in platelet aggregation, and hence in platelet thrombosis, has led to the development of a number of parenteral and oral glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitors for use in cardiovascular disease states, such as acute coronary syndromes and stroke. The predominant effect of these agents is to inhibit platelet aggregation, although studies of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 receptor function and various GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors have demonstrated the potential for these agents to produce effects on other aspects of platelet function, in addition to non-platelet effects. Overall, clinical studies have demonstrated an impressive beneficial effect for parenteral agents in reducing ischemic complications following percutaneous intervention, and a more modest beneficial effect in the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndromes. Trials with oral GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors in similar patient populations have demonstrated toxicity, manifested by an increased mortality in treated patients. Increased understanding of molecular aspects of both \u03b1IIb\u03b23 receptor function and the effects of GP IIb/IIIa inhibition may help explain some of the inconsistency in recently reported clinical studies with parenteral agents, and the frank toxicity of oral agents. Such studies may also hold the key to the development of newer agents with enhanced therapeutic benefit.", "citation_paragraph": "The first GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor used in humans was a mouse monoclonal antibody that blocked the a IIb b 3 receptor [74] . In an effort to reduce immunogenicity, the heavy-and light-chain variable regions of this antibody were subsequently attached to the constant regions of human IgG 1 and kappa chains, respectively, to produce a chimeric antibody called abciximab (ReoPro; Centocor). Abciximab is a high-affinity antagonist with a dissociation constant (K d ) of 5 nmol/l, resulting in a predominantly receptor-bound distribution following administration [75] . Abciximab appears to bind to a site on the a IIb b 3 receptor that is distinct from the ligand-binding site, since it may bind to the receptor even if the binding pocket is occupied by RGD peptides. The inhibitory effect of abciximab may be due to steric hindrance of the ligand access pocket. The cross-reactivity of abciximab with the vitronectin receptor (a v b 3 ), which is found on the surface of endothelial, platelet, and smooth muscle membranes, makes it likely that the b 3 subunit provides the epitope for abciximab binding [76, 77] . Abciximab also interacts with lower affinity to the activated Mac-1 (a M b 2 ) receptor on the surface of myeloid leucocytes (PMNs and monocytes) [76, 77] . Abciximab is currently approved for use in patients undergoing PCI only, although it has been studied in ACS populations [78, 79] . It is administered as a bolus (0.25 mg/kg) followed by a 12-h infusion (0.125 mg/kg per minute). The bolus dose represents ~75 % of the total dose administered to an 80-kg individual. Because of the high affinity and rapid on-rate of abciximab for its receptor, two-thirds of the bolus dose becomes bound to the a IIb b 3 receptor within minutes. The infusion is required because of the slow, yet appreciable, dissociation rate of abciximab from the platelet surface. This dosing regimen has remained remarkably constant through all of the clinical PCI and ACS trials with abciximab. As with the other GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors, inhibition of fibrinogen binding occurs in a concentration-dependent manner. Within minutes of the bolus dose, the vast majority (~90 %) of the a IIb b 3 receptors are occupied [80] . This degree of receptor occupancy is associated with a median ADP-induced platelet aggregation response of < 10 % of baseline [81 -83] . During the course of the infusion, the extent of inhibition in most patients declines gradually and the consistency of inhibition becomes less uniform, perhaps due to the emergence of the platelet a granule storage pool of receptors [84, 85] . Nevertheless, at the completion of the 12-h infusion, most patients continue to have > 80 % receptor occupancy, and the median platelet aggregation is ~20 % of baseline [81 -83, 86] . Abciximab has a slow half-time rate of dissociation from the a IIb b 3 receptor of up to 4 h. Furthermore, abciximab redistributes from platelet to platelet in vivo, as suggested by the unimodal decrease in abciximab binding by flow cytometry [87] . An estimated 29 % and 13 % of a IIb b 3 receptors are occupied by abciximab at 8 and 15 days, respectively, following completion of the infusion. Functionally, these pharmacodynamic properties of abciximab result in significant platelet inhibition as assessed by platelet aggregometry at 12 and 24 h post-infusion which return to normal after 72 h [72, 82] . However, platelet function assessment using shear-induced platelet deposition remains abnormal up to 7 days post-infusion [ Review Article 487 rinogen binding [89] . Eptifibatide may act in a similar manner. Eptifibatide is a low-affinity inhibitor compared to abciximab (K d 120 nmol/l), with a rapid onset of action. The drug dissociates rapidly from the receptor leading to significantly higher circulating pools of unbound eptifibatide as compared with abciximab [75] . In the plasma, 25 % of the drug is bound to plasma proteins while the remainder constitutes the pool of pharmacologically active drug. Eptifibatide is primarily cleared by the kidney, making dose adjustment necessary in patients with significant renal dysfunction. Eptifibatide is currently licensed for use in patients with ACS and in patients undergoing PCI. Unlike abciximab, there have been significant refinements in the dosing of eptifibatide since the initial phase II dose-finding studies. These studies suggested a bolus dose of 135 mg followed by an infusion of 0.5 mg/min provided adequate inhibition of platelet function. However, the sample anticoagulant in these studies was the calcium chelator sodium citrate, which lowers the fibrinogen-binding affinity of the a IIb b 3 receptor and facilitates eptifibatide binding. The result was to artificially exaggerate the ex vivo effect of eptifibatide compared to the in vivo clinical effect [90] . Subsequent studies increased both the bolus dose (to 180 mg/kg) and infusion rate (to 2 mg/kg per minute) for treatment of patients with ACS [91] , and used a doublebolus (180 mg/kg repeated at 10 min) and infusion (2 mg/kg per minute) regimen for patients undergoing PCI [92] . The infusion is generally continued for 48-72 h in patients with ACS and for 24 h in patients undergoing PCI. Most of the clinically relevant in vivo human data on the ability of eptifibatide to inhibit platelet function pertains to the 180 mg/kg bolus and 2 mg/kg per minute infusion regimen. Within 10 min of this bolus and infusion regimen, there is > 80 % inhibition of platelet function as assessed by the RPFA or standard light transmission turbidimetric aggregometry using 20 mmol/l ADP as the platelet agonist [82, 83, 86] . A recent study of patients with ACS suggests a transient recovery in platelet aggregation between 1 and 4 h post-bolus [93] . Most other studies report maintainence of inhibition of > 80 % of platelet function throughout the duration of the infusion [82, 83, 86] . Due to the rapid dissociation of the drug, restoration of normal platelet function using standard aggregometry techniques occurs within 4 h of cessation of the infusion. Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic data with the double-bolus and infusion regimen of eptifibatide are more limited. However, the data from patients undergoing PCI suggests that this regimen eliminates the transient loss of platelet inhibition seen with the single-bolus and infusion regimen [94] . It also produces more adequate a IIb b 3 receptor blockade (~80 %) and inhibition of platelet aggregation (> 90 %).", "citance": "A recent study of patients with ACS suggests a transient recovery in platelet aggregation between 1 and 4 h post-bolus [93] .", "claims": [{"text": "Abciximap impedes recovery in platelet aggregation between 1 and 4 hours post-bolus in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS)", "subject": "Abciximap ", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Abciximap promotes recovery in platelet aggregation between 1 and 4 hours post-bolus in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS)", "subject": "Abciximap ", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 57375527, "title": "The interplay between metabolic alterations, diastolic strain rate and exercise capacity in mild heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a cardiovascular magnetic resonance study", "abstract": "BACKGROUND Heart failure (HF) is characterized by altered myocardial substrate metabolism which can lead to myocardial triglyceride accumulation (steatosis) and lipotoxicity. However its role in mild HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is uncertain. We measured myocardial triglyceride content (MTG) in HFpEF and assessed its relationships with diastolic function and exercise capacity.   METHODS Twenty seven HFpEF (clinical features of HF, left ventricular EF >50%, evidence of mild diastolic dysfunction and evidence of exercise limitation as assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise test) and 14 controls underwent 1H-cardiovascular magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-CMRS) to measure MTG (lipid/water, %), 31P-CMRS to measure myocardial energetics (phosphocreatine-to-adenosine triphosphate - PCr/ATP) and feature-tracking cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging for diastolic strain rate.   RESULTS When compared to controls, HFpEF had 2.3 fold higher in MTG (1.45 \u00b1 0.25% vs. 0.64 \u00b1 0.16%, p = 0.009) and reduced PCr/ATP (1.60 \u00b1 0.09 vs. 2.00 \u00b1 0.10, p = 0.005). HFpEF had significantly reduced diastolic strain rate and maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max), which both correlated significantly with elevated MTG and reduced PCr/ATP. On multivariate analyses, MTG was independently associated with diastolic strain rate while diastolic strain rate was independently associated with VO2 max.   CONCLUSIONS Myocardial steatosis is pronounced in mild HFpEF, and is independently associated with impaired diastolic strain rate which is itself related to exercise capacity. Steatosis may adversely affect exercise capacity by indirect effect occurring via impairment in diastolic function. As such, myocardial triglyceride may become a potential therapeutic target to treat the increasing number of patients with HFpEF.", "citation_paragraph": "The present study has three major findings. First, there is pronounced myocardial steatosis in patients with mild HFpEF, with a 2.3-fold increase in MTG compared to age, gender-and BMI-matched healthy controls. Second, steatosis (but not energetics) is independently associated with impaired diastolic strain rate. Third, reduced VO 2 max is related to elevated MTG, and this relationship may be mediated through impaired diastolic strain rate.While steatosis is known to be associated with diastolic dysfunction in diabetes [28] , data on steatosis in HFpEF and its relationship with cardiac function and exercise capacity are lacking. There is only one study recently showing steatosis in a small number of young women (n = 5) with microvascular dysfunction and subclinical HFpEF [15] . Here, we demonstrate for the first time MTG in a larger number (n = 27) of typically elderly patients with HFpEF, who have limiting exertional dyspnoea, abnormal diastolic function demonstrated by Doppler echo and CMR FT, and objective evidence of exercise-limitation by CPET. We categorized our HFpEF cohort as mild as although they fulfilled the criteria based on the guidelines [18, 19] their diastolic abnormalities were mildly impaired which were likely due to the effect of taking diuretics.Importantly, we show that elevated MTG independently correlated with impaired diastolic strain rate. The mechanisms leading to such pronounced steatosis remain to be completely understood, but it is well established that cardiac hypertrophy is associated with altered myocardial substrate metabolism with a shift towards glucose and away from FA oxidation, leading to increased myocardial lipid accumulation, non-oxidative metabolism and reduced cardiac function [8, 29, 30] . While our data show that MTG and diastolic strain rate have significant correlations with exercise capacity, only diastolic strain rate independently correlated with VO 2 max. This is not surprising given the fact the abnormal resting diastolic function has been shown to be associated with worsening of exercise capacity [31] . Furthermore the underlying mechanism of MTG directly affecting VO 2 max is unclear and could potentially be mediated through reduced diastolic strain rate. While our data do not prove a direct causal link, they may suggest a pathophysiological role of steatosis in the development of diastolic dysfunction and reduced functional capacity in mild HFpEF. It would have been interesting to demonstrate more profound impairment in diastolic function along with changes in metabolic substrate metabolism during exercise. In fact, Phan et al has previously shown more profound diastolic abnormalities during stress radionuclide ventriculography in HFpEF, which were not seen at rest [16] . In future, taking blood samples for plasma substrate and metabolomics during exercise to assess changes in substrate metabolism would support the findings in the present study. In the present study, our HFpEF patients had increased LV wall thickness and significant concentric remodeling, despite normal LV mass. Given our cross-sectional study design, we cannot determine if cardiac steatosis causes LV remodeling or vice versa. However, several studies using animal models of pathological hypertrophy have demonstrated a causal link between steatosis and development of cardiac remodeling [29, 30] . Cardiac steatosis can lead to production of harmful intermediates and apoptosis. These can stimulate hypertrophic signalling leading to concentric LV hypertrophy followed by eventually a dilated phenotype [32, 33] . The question remains, what is the potential driving factor for metabolic alteration and steatosis in HFpEF? Kato et al recently showed that HFpEF patients have reduced coronary reserve due to microvascular dysfunction [34] , and this has been proposed as a possible trigger of the metabolic switch and steatosis prior to the development of cardiac hypertrophy [15] .Impaired myocardial energetics has been demonstrated in asymptomatic diastolic dysfunction due to obesity [35] and also in HFpEF [16] . Here we extend the findings by showing significant correlations between energetics, diastolic strain rate and exercise capacity in mild HFpEF. Metabolic alterations in hypertrophied hearts have been shown to include impaired myocardial energetics [30] , and detrimental effects of ceramides on mitochondria can lead to reduced intracellular ATP production, apoptosis and reduced cardiac function [36] . This may be a mechanism behind the observed relationship between myocardial energetics and function in the current study. Although both myocardial energetics status and triglyceride content correlated with diastolic strain rate, only steatosis independently correlated with diastolic strain rate. These are in keeping with a previous study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preserved LVEF, showing an independent association of steatosis with diastolic dysfunction [28] . This is an important finding and suggests that the pathophysiological cascade leading to diastolic dysfunction in HFpEF may involve steatosis at an earlier stage than energetic derangement -an observation with potential consequences in our search for therapeutic targets in HFpEF.The current study provides novel insight into the pathophysiological role of steatosis in mild HFpEF. While inhibition of FA oxidation and stimulation of glucose oxidation may be beneficial in HF due to ischaemic insults [37, 38] , cardiac lipid modulation by augmenting FA oxidation might be an alternative therapeutic strategy in non-ischaemic HF [8, 30] . Since myocardial steatosis is modifiable, novel metabolic therapies aimed at improving/preserving cardiac function and exercise capacity, thus delaying the progression to the more severe form of HFpEF by reducing MTG should be tested. Potential therapeutic agents are glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1) agonists, mineralocorticoid receptor blockers such as eplerenone, and fenofibrate, which have been shown to reduce myocardial steatosis in Type 2 Diabetes [33, 39, 40] .", "citance": "This is not surprising given the fact the abnormal resting diastolic function has been shown to be associated with worsening of exercise capacity [31] .", "claims": [{"text": "Abnormal resting diastolic function is associated with improved exercise capacity", "subject": "worsening exercise capacity", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Abnormal resting diastolic function is associated with worsening exercise capacity", "subject": "worsening exercise capacity", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 6891732, "title": "cAMP signaling in skeletal muscle adaptation: hypertrophy, metabolism, and regeneration.", "abstract": "Among organ systems, skeletal muscle is perhaps the most structurally specialized. The remarkable subcellular architecture of this tissue allows it to empower movement with instructions from motor neurons. Despite this high degree of specialization, skeletal muscle also has intrinsic signaling mechanisms that allow adaptation to long-term changes in demand and regeneration after acute damage. The second messenger adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) not only elicits acute changes within myofibers during exercise but also contributes to myofiber size and metabolic phenotype in the long term. Strikingly, sustained activation of cAMP signaling leads to pronounced hypertrophic responses in skeletal myofibers through largely elusive molecular mechanisms. These pathways can promote hypertrophy and combat atrophy in animal models of disorders including muscular dystrophy, age-related atrophy, denervation injury, disuse atrophy, cancer cachexia, and sepsis. cAMP also participates in muscle development and regeneration mediated by muscle precursor cells; thus, downstream signaling pathways may potentially be harnessed to promote muscle regeneration in patients with acute damage or muscular dystrophy. In this review, we summarize studies implicating cAMP signaling in skeletal muscle adaptation. We also highlight ligands that induce cAMP signaling and downstream effectors that are promising pharmacological targets.", "citation_paragraph": "Adaptive functions of sustained GPCR signaling have been identified using chronic treatment with agonists and antagonists in humans and model organisms (9, 18, 43, 57, 63, 86, 91, 101, 115, 121, 154, 155, 197) as well as by targeted genetic approaches in mice (42, 163, 164) . These and other studies have revealed striking myofiber hypertrophy and fiber-type transitions to faster fiber types with prolonged activation of \u2424-AR signaling in particular. Although there is evidence supporting cAMP-dependent signaling as a mediator of long-term adaptive responses to \u2424-AR agonists and possibly other GPCR ligands (42, 98) , additional downstream effector pathways mediated by G\u2423 i /PKC (163) and Akt (127) are also clearly involved. These alternate pathways may or may not respond to initial or sustained cAMP production. In this section, we provide an overview of the effects of sustained activation of cAMP-coupled GPCRs in skeletal muscle, focusing on myofiber hypertrophy and fiber-type transitions. For an additional discussion, the reader is referred to a comprehensive review by Lynch and Ryall (151) .Hypertrophy. Myofiber hypertrophy is a form of muscle adaptation that occurs in response to resistance exercise (226) . There is great interest in understanding molecular mechanisms underlying this adaptive response, because skeletal muscle atrophy accompanies and exacerbates many pathological states, including disuse, denervation injury, cancer, AIDS, and aging (reviewed in Ref. 71 ). Increased muscle mass and myofiber cross-sectional area in adult skeletal muscles are brought about by shifts in the relative rates of protein synthesis and degradation; the net result is enhanced muscle strength (71) . It has been appreciated for many years that systemic treatment with \u2424 2 -AR agonists such as clenbuterol (Table 1) induces skeletal muscle hypertrophy in rodents, large mammals, and humans (reviewed in Ref. 151) (Fig. 3) . Additionally, \u2424-adrenergic agonists blunt muscle atrophy after denervation (253), muscular dystrophy (192) , or nutritional deficiency (73) . At the cellular level, clenbuterol has been shown to stimulate total protein synthesis (57, 154) and translational efficiency (155) as well as reduce proteolysis in rabbit, rat, and chick skeletal muscles (18, 63, 190) . These effects are probably mediated by cAMP, as PDE inhibitors reduce atrophy in skeletal muscle (98) and a cell-permeable cAMP analog (db-cAMP) or PDE inhibitors reduce proteolysis in muscle studied ex vivo (11, 170) . Moreover, in cell culture models of hyperthermia-induced proteolysis, formoterol (a \u2424 2 -AR agonist) reduced proteolysis by a mechanism dependent on AC activity (3). In Fig. 3 . GPCRs that induce myofiber hypertrophy. Four GPCRs (Fzd7, \u24242-AR, CRFR2, and LPA receptor) have been shown to stimulate hypertrophy in myotubes and/or myofibers. Cognate ligands are italicized. A partial view of the known signaling mediators is shown. CRFR2 stimulates myofiber growth by an uncharacterized effector pathway. \u24242-AR also induces fiber type transitions to fast-twitch fibers (not shown). addition, activation of the GPCR Fzd7 (Frizzled 7) by Wnt7a was also shown to induce hypertrophy in rodent myotubes via a pathway involving G\u2423 s (237) . On the contrary, mice lacking G\u2423 s , which stimulates cAMP production, have smaller myofibers than littermate controls (42) . In pathological settings, ligands for two GPCRs, \u2424 2 -AR and CRFR2, reduce atrophy or help sustain muscle function and strength in rodent models after denervation (100, 101, 123, 127, 154, 253, 255) , unloading (99, 101, 123, 127) or aging (35) . \u2424 2 -AR agonists have also been shown to reduce muscle atrophy in animals with cancer cachexia (31, 33, 46) . In addition, agonists for \u2424 2 -AR or CRF receptors improve muscle function in dystrophin-deficient mdx (86, 90, 103, 185, 192, 254, 256) and laminin-deficient dy/dy (94) mice. However, efficacy of \u2424 2 -AR agonists on muscle size and force generation vary with the type and dose of agonist, as well as the muscle studied. Small scale clinical trials in muscular dystrophy patients revealed limited promise of the \u2424 2 -AR agonist albuterol (64, 125, 126, 235) , which appeared to improve muscle function with varying effects on muscle strength (211) . These studies have been extensively analyzed by Lynch and Ryall (151) .Although genetic and pharmacological studies confirmed that the anabolic effects of clenbuterol in rodents are mediated by \u2424 2 -ARs (43, 102), the precise molecular mechanisms by which \u2424 2 -AR signaling induces hypertrophy are still not fully elucidated. Both \u2424 2 -AR and CRFR2 are expressed in muscle cells and are capable of stimulating cAMP production (54, 124, 179) . The phenotype of smaller myofibers in G\u2423 s knockout mice provides genetic evidence that cAMP signaling does have a role in myofiber hypertrophy (42) (Fig. 3) . Moreover, activation of a noncanonical signaling pathway by Wnt7a-Fzd7 is also sufficient to drive muscle fiber hypertrophy in vitro (237) . The authors found that Fzd7 physically interacts with G\u2423 s , and G\u2423 s is required for Fzd7-induced PI 3-kinase activation and hypertrophy (237) . However, the recent study by Minetti et al. (163) demonstrates that the inhibitory G protein G\u2423 i2 is also sufficient to promote myofiber hypertrophy in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 3) . In other cell types, \u2424 2 -AR and CRFR2 have been shown to activate additional effector pathways such as G\u2423 q -PLC, G\u2423 i -PKC, G\u2424\u2425, or \u2424-arrestin-Akt (25, 76, 77, 89, 243) , which could mediate anabolic effects of these receptors (Fig. 4 ). An additional possibility is that after initial activation of G\u2423 s , PKA phosphorylation of the \u2424 2 -AR causes it to couple to G\u2423 i . This mechanism occurs in cardiac muscle (243) and soleus (76) , and it will be interesting to determine whether this regulatory mechanism is a general feature of all skeletal muscle types. Nonetheless, dynamic coupling to G proteins by chronically stimulated receptors could account for observations that inhibition of G\u2423 s or activation of G\u2423 i leads to opposite changes in myofiber size.Many studies have established that IGF-I strongly activates muscle hypertrophy by stimulating the PI 3-kinase-Akt pathway (10, 166) (Fig. 4) . Akt, in turn, activates the downstream kinase mTOR, which stimulates p70 S6 kinase and other effectors, ultimately culminating in enhanced protein synthesis (23, 191) . In addition, Akt represses FoxO (F box, class O) transcription factors, which drive expression of muscle-specific ring finger E3 ubiquitin ligases MuRF1 (Muscle RING Finger 1) and MAFbx (Muscle Atrophy F-box, also called Atrogin-1) when Akt signaling tone is reduced (22, 201, 217) . The potent effects of IGF-I-Akt signaling on muscle hypertrophy prompted several investigators to address the role of Akt signaling in muscle responses to clenbuterol (Figs. 3 and 4) . Kline et al. (127) showed that clenbuterol activates Akt in skeletal muscle, and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin partly blocks anabolic effects of clenbuterol. In agreement with these findings, \u2424 2 -AR agonists promoted muscle protein synthesis after 7 days with concomitant activation of Akt (130) (Fig. 4) . Clenbuterol treatment has also been associated with a transient increase of activated p70 S6 kinase (212) . Signaling from \u2424 2 -AR to Akt appears to be direct and not mediated by an autocrine pathway, as adrenergic signaling does not induce IGF-I protein expression in skeletal muscle (127, 245) . It has been proposed that, similar to cardiac muscle, the signaling mechanism from \u2424 2 -AR to Akt could be mediated by G\u2424\u2425 (127) . Consistent with this model, myotube hypertrophy induced by ectopically expressed G\u2423 i2 was blocked by rapamycin or PKC inhibitors, but not by PI 3-kinase inhibitors, suggesting that G protein signaling to Akt is direct (163) (Fig. 4) . Alternatively, the recent data from von Maltzahn et al. (237) clearly implicate direct activation of PI 3-kinase by G\u2423 s or released G\u2424\u2425 as a mechanism for Akt activation by Fzd7, a G\u2423 s -coupled receptor. Another intriguing possibility is that Akt could be activated by \u2424-arrestin upon \u2424 2 -AR activation, as recently observed in fibroblasts (89) . This hypothesis has not been tested in skeletal muscle. The same signaling mechanism may apply to other GPCRs. However, it is important to note that, although CRFR2 agonists induce muscle hypertrophy and blunt muscle atrophy (99 -101), they actually inhibit insulin-Akt signaling (37) . Therefore, multiple molecular mechanisms may mediate antiatrophic effects of GPCRs in skeletal muscle. Ultimate determination of how G\u2423 s -coupled receptors activate Akt will activates Akt, which stimulates protein synthesis via activating mTOR and inhibits muscle-specific ubiquitin ligase expression via repressive phosphorylation of FoxO transcription factors. \u24242-AR signaling leads to muscle hypertrophy, which is accompanied by activation of Akt, activation of protein synthesis, and inhibition of proteolysis. PKA signaling induces calpastatin transcription and inhibits calpains by an unknown mechanism. \u24242-AR signaling also activates Akt by an unknown mechanism, possibly mediated by G\u2424\u2425 subunits, \u2424-arrestin, or PKA (dashed arrows). Not shown: Wnt7a-Fzd7-G\u2423s activates PI 3-kinase directly.provide mechanistic insight into the commonly observed effects of \u2424 2 -AR agonists and other GPCR ligands on muscle hypertrophy and may uncover new targets for therapeutic promotion of muscle growth.In addition to promoting muscle growth and protein synthesis, cAMP signaling inhibits proteolysis by both calpains and the ubiquitin proteasome system. Calpains are calcium-activated proteases, which are inhibited by the protein calpastatin (reviewed in Ref. 168 ). \u2424-AR agonists reduce calpain activity in skeletal muscle tissue in animal models (9, 63, 169) . This occurs in part by cAMP-induced expression of the inhibitor calpastatin (Fig. 4) via CREB binding sites in the bovine (45) , porcine (206) , and human (257) calpastatin gene promoters. cAMP might also regulate calpastatin expression by posttranslational mechanisms, as CREB binding sites have not been annotated in the rodent promoters (257) . In addition, calpastatin activity was elevated in porcine and rat skeletal muscle after continuous infusion with \u2424-AR agonists even though the calpastatin mRNA was not uniformly induced (130, 176) . Animal models support modulation of the calpain system as a useful therapeutic strategy: mdx mice have aberrantly high levels of calpain activity (228) , whereas muscle-specific overexpression of calpastatin reduces atrophy in disuse models (199, 229) and reduces necrosis in mdx muscle (214) , but perhaps does not improve overall regeneration (27) .The other major proteolytic system in skeletal muscle is the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Two E3 ubiquitin ligases, MuRF1 and MAFbx/Atrogin-1, undergo massive transcriptional induction in skeletal muscle after denervation injury (22) . Mice lacking MuRF1 or MAFbx/Atrogin-1 are resistant to muscle atrophy, demonstrating the crucial role of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in this pathology (22) . MuRF1 and MAFbx/Atrogin-1 mRNAs are induced by FoxO transcription factors FoxO1 and FoxO3a, which are normally sequestered in the cytoplasm by Akt phosphorylation (201, 217) (Fig. 4) . The \u2424 2 -AR agonist clenbuterol reduces amounts of high-molecular-weight ubiquitin conjugates and proteasome activity in fast-twitch skeletal muscles undergoing atrophy from hindlimb unloading (245) , suggesting the possibility that \u2424-AR activation also suppresses FoxO activity. Consistently, clenbuterol potently suppresses both MuRF1 and MAFbx/Atrogin-1 transcription in normal muscle and attenuates expression of these genes in atrophying muscle in rats (127) . In addition, cAMP signaling activates Akt and represses ubiquitin-proteasome pathway activity in C 2 C 12 cells and rat skeletal muscle (73) . It is tempting to speculate that FoxO transcription factors might mediate the activity of \u2424-AR on Murf1 and Mafbx/Atrogin-1; indeed, FoxO3A phosphorylation correlates with clenbuterol-induced Akt phosphorylation in vivo in muscle from fasted animals (73) . FoxO1 phosphorylation has not been explored in this model, and much uncertainty remains regarding the mechanisms by which \u2424 2 -AR agonists modulate ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation in skeletal muscle.Four GPCRs, \u2424 2 -AR, CRFR2, the LPA receptor, and Fzd7, have been shown to induce hypertrophy in skeletal muscle or isolated myotubes. The field is closer to understanding mechanisms underlying GPCR-induced hypertrophy, and it will be of great scientific and clinical interest to determine whether these receptors utilize common effector pathways. It is clear that CRFR2 signaling can block pathological muscle atrophy. However, genetic and pharmacological studies indicate that Ucn2 inhibits Akt signaling (37); so alternate downstream effector pathways likely mediate the anabolic effects of this ligand-receptor pair. Given the promising anabolic effects of CRFR2 agonists on mouse models, it will be important for future studies to rigorously interrogate the signaling pathway mediating these effects. It will also be exciting to determine whether chronic stimulation of other GPCRs expressed in skeletal muscle have the same hypertrophic effects in normal muscle and anti-atrophic effects in aging or diseased muscle.Metabolic adaptation. In the postnatal period, skeletal myofibers develop distinct phenotypic characteristics that enable classification into one of several fiber types, including slow oxidative (type 1), fast oxidative (type IIa), and fast glycolytic (type IIb or type IIx) (reviewed in Ref 203) . Despite this initial specialization, phenotypes of individual muscle fibers are plastic in adult mammals. Cross-innervation studies in model organisms demonstrated that the pattern of motor neuron firing (tonic or phasic) dictates muscle fiber phenotypes and that fast and slow fibers can be interconverted by altering the pattern of innervation by denervation or by endurance exercise (203) . At the molecular level, changes to a slow fiber phenotype are mediated by several signal transduction pathways, which drive mitochondrial proliferation and activate transcription of slow myosin isoforms, myoglobin, and enzymes involved in oxidative metabolism (203) . Schiaffino et al. (203) provide a comprehensive discussion of muscle fiber type plasticity.Several observations associate cAMP signaling with oxidative adaptation to exercise. First, epinephrine is released into circulation during exercise (67) , and intramuscular cAMP increases within minutes of treadmill running (72) . Second, \u2424-AR density is highest in oxidative muscles and correlates with oxidative capacity in mixed or intermediate fiber types (62, 156, 240) ; AC activity is also increased by endurance training in rats (28) . Third, in cultured muscle cells, agents that induce intracellular cAMP activate oxidative enzymes, some at the level of expression (66, 136) . Additionally, \u2424-AR signaling or cAMP-sensitive transcription factors have been reported to regulate genes involved in oxidative metabolism, including Pgc1\u2423 (PPAR\u2425 coactivator 1\u2423) (2, 164, 242) , cytochrome c (65), CoxIV (cytochrome c oxidase IV) (75) , and orphan nuclear receptors Nor1 (neuron-derived orphan receptor 1, or Nr4a3) and Nur77 (nuclear receptor family member 77, or Nr4a1) (157, 178) . Overexpression of cAMP-activated CREB coactivators is also sufficient to induce mitochondrial proliferation in cultured myotubes (242) . In rats, the \u2424-adrenergic antagonist propranolol blunted activation of mitochondrial enzyme activity after endurance treadmill training (115) , but a histological examination of fiber types was not shown in that study. In additional studies, propranolol substantially reduced normal increases in mitochondrial enzyme activity of rat muscles (91), although the effects varied among fiber types (227) . In addition, Kraus et al. (131) showed that chronic electrical stimulation of fast-twitch muscles elicited an increase in cAMP with concomitant induction of mRNAs encoding myoglobin and proteins involved in oxidative metabolism. These correlations could imply that \u2424-AR-cAMP signaling during exercise participates in oxidative metabolic adaptation of skeletal muscle.However, compelling genetic and pharmacological data from mice and humans suggest that this is not likely the case. In humans, mitochondrial enzyme activity increases with en-durance exercise despite treatment with the beta-blocker propranolol, and no significant change in fiber-type percentage or cross-sectional area was reported in this study (221) . Moreover, Pgc1\u2423 expression was still induced, albeit to a lesser extent, by treadmill training in mice lacking all \u2424-ARs (164). It is also notable that, although the CREB binding site is required for Pgc1\u2423 promoter activation in response to electrical stimulation (2), the CREB family protein ATF2 binds this site and mediates Pgc1\u2423 transcription in this setting (1) . Additionally, mice with muscle-specific deletion of G\u2423 s or overexpression of G\u2423 i2 (both leading to reduced cAMP accumulation in muscle) exhibit fiber-type switching toward a higher proportion of oxidative fibers (42, 163) . Genetic inhibition of CREB activity in differentiated muscle leads to defects in myofiber survival but not alterations in muscle fiber type (19) . Finally, a large body of data from humans and model organisms shows that chronic stimulation of \u2424 2 -AR signaling causes shifts toward faster, not slower, myofiber phenotypes (14, 47, 55, 150, 180, 183, 252) .The molecular mechanism by which \u2424 2 -AR agonists induce fast fiber-type transitions is not known. Shi et al. (208) found that isoproterenol treatment of C 2 C 12 myoblasts stimulates promoters of MyHC-IIb (myosin heavy chain IIb) and Serca1 (sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2\u03e9 -ATPase) genes, which are expressed in fast myofibers. In addition, clenbuterol activated a MyHC-IIb reporter in mouse gastrocnemius muscle (208) . As ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase) activation by clenbuterol was greater in fast muscles than in slow muscles, the authors propose that ERK signaling downstream of the \u2424 2 -AR mediates fast fiber-type transitions in clenbuterol-treated animals (208) . It will be interesting to further test this mechanism using additional loss-of-function approaches. Lynch and Ryall (151) noted that overexpression of Eya1/Six1 induces expression of fast-type MyHC-IIb myosin in soleus (81) and proposed this as a possible unexplored mechanism to explain the fiber-type transitions observed with sustained clenbuterol treatment. The observations that mice with targeted deletion of G\u2423 s (42) or overexpression of G\u2423 i2 (163) have more slow-twitch fibers are consistent with promotion of fast fiber-type switching by cAMP effectors. Interestingly, both AC2 and AC7 mRNAs are enriched in fast myofibers (87, 232) , so it is possible that these fibers have more sustained cAMP production in a chronic treatment setting. However, in rats, AC and PKA activity are both higher in slow-twitch soleus than in fast-twitch extensor digitorum longus muscles (28, 104, 240) , and AC activity increases more after exercise training in oxidative muscles (28) . Finally, although CREB stimulates genes involved in oxidative metabolism (242), it is possible that cAMP-induced transcriptional responses are dampened by autoregulatory feedback loops after prolonged \u2424-AR activation (236) . This notion is supported by microarray data showing that acute \u2424-AR agonist treatment induces genes involved in oxidative metabolism, whereas prolonged treatment is associated with repression of genes involved in myostatin signaling (177) .In summary, ligands capable of inducing cAMP signaling exert hypertrophic effects on skeletal muscle and, in some cases, induce fast fiber-type transitions. Receptor and AC isoform expression is not well correlated with measured AC and PKA activities among fiber types. Thus, expression patterns do not simply account for the observed changes to faster fiber types with prolonged adrenergic agonist treatment. The recent finding that inhibitory G\u2423 i2 induces hypertrophy as well as oxidative fiber-type transitions (163) underscores the importance of further investigation into whether and how different signaling mediators, possibly independently of cAMP, contribute to the phenotypes observed with prolonged activation of GPCRs in skeletal muscle.", "citance": "addition, activation of the GPCR Fzd7 (Frizzled 7) by Wnt7a was also shown to induce hypertrophy in rodent myotubes via a pathway involving G\u2423 s (237) .", "claims": [{"text": "Activation of Frizzled 7 (Fzd7) by Wnt7a induces hypertrophy in rodent myotubes.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Activation of Frizzled 7 (Fzd7) by Wnt7a induces hypotrophy in rodent myotubes.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}

Therefore, to elucidate molecular characteristics of diffuse cerebellar gliomas (DCGs), 27 adult, mostly glioblastoma cases were analyzed. Comprehensive analysis using whole-exome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and Infinium methylation array (n = 17) demonstrated their distinct molecular profile compared to gliomas in other brain regions. Frequent mutations in chromatin-modifier genes were identified including, noticeably, a truncating mutation in SETD2 (n = 4), which resulted in loss of H3K36 trimethylation and was mutually exclusive with H3F3A K27M mutation (n = 3), suggesting that epigenetic dysregulation may lead to DCG tumorigenesis. Alterations that cause loss of p53 function including TP53 mutation (n = 9), PPM1D mutation (n = 2), and a novel type of PPM1D fusion (n = 1), were also frequent. On the other hand, mutations and copy number changes commonly observed in cerebral gliomas were infrequent. DNA methylation profile analysis demonstrated that all DCGs except for those with H3F3A mutations were categorized in the \"RTK I (PDGFRA)\" group, and those DCGs had a gene expression signature that was highly associated with PDGFRA. Furthermore, compared with the data of 315 gliomas derived from different brain regions, promoter methylation of transcription factors genes associated with glial development showed a characteristic pattern presumably reflecting their tumor origin. Notably, SOX10, a key transcription factor associated with oligodendroglial differentiation and PDGFRA regulation, was up-regulated in both DCG and H3 K27M-mutant diffuse midline glioma, suggesting their developmental and biological commonality. In contrast, SOX10 was silenced by promoter methylation in most cerebral gliomas. These findings may suggest potential tailored targeted therapy for gliomas according to their brain region, in addition to providing molecular clues to identify the region-related cellular origin of DCGs.", "citation_paragraph": "To explore driver mutations of DCGs, WES was performed using Illumina HiSeq. Seventeen tumors (14 WHO grade IV, one grade III, and two grade II) and matched normal blood samples were analyzed (Online Resource 2: Table S1 ). Mean coverage of the coding sequence for tumors and normal blood samples was 122.3\u00d7 and 97.7\u00d7, respectively, with 96.8 and 96.6%, respectively, of bases covered more than 20\u00d7 (Online Resource 2: Table S3 ). The tumor content ratio as calculated by the karkinos computational pipeline had a mean value of 61.0%, ranging from 12.0 to 91.3% (Online Resource 2: Table S5 ). In total, 17,682 tumor-specific somatic mutations were identified, of which 5735 (32.4%) were non-synonymous (Online Resource 2: Table S6 ). For validation of mutation detection, each position in matched RNA-sequencing reads was examined. Of all positions where non-synonymous mutation was detected, 3021 (2952 substitutions and 69 indels) positions had more than 10 reads in RNA sequencing, and 2647 (2605 substitutions and 42 indels) positions (87.6%) had the same mutation reads, indicating a reasonably high reliability of the WES considering the limited sensitivity of RNA sequencing in detecting mutations. Two cases (DCG_04 and 17) had higher numbers of mutations with loss-of-function mutations in mismatch repair genes, indicating that they were hypermutators (Fig. 1a) . The total number of non-synonymous mutations in other non-hypermutator cases was 818 (average 54.5, range 7-178), which included less than 20% of truncating mutations (Online Resource 1: Fig. S3) .The mutational landscape of the 17 DCGs is shown in Fig. 1a and Online Resource 1: Fig. S4 . All 35 mutations including five indels in Fig. 1a were validated either by RNA-sequencing reads (28 mutations) or Sanger sequencing (seven mutations) (Online Resource 1: Fig. S5 ). Among genes related to chromatin regulation, the H3F3A K27M mutation, which constitutes a diagnostic criterion for H3 K27M-mutant diffuse midline glioma in the 2016 WHO classification, was observed in three DCGs. All three had pathological features of GBM and were not particularly located near the brainstem compared to other DCGs (Online Resource 1: Fig. S1 ). Notably, loss-of-function mutations in SETD2 were found in four GBM cases, and SETD2 mutations were mutually exclusive with the H3F3A K27M mutation. SETD2 regulates chromatin function by methylating histone H3K36. However, no mutation in other genes responsible for H3K36 mono-or di-methylation such as NSD1-3, ASH1L, or SMYD2 was detected except for in the two hypermutator cases.Disruption of p53 function was common in DCGs, and TP53 was the most frequently mutated gene (58.9%). Activation of PPM1D suppresses p53 function [41, 55] . The activating truncation mutation of PPM1D was found in two cases, and was mutually exclusive with TP53 mutation.FGFR1 mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain, which has been reported in pilocytic astrocytomas, diffuse brainstem gliomas, and thalamic gliomas, was identified in two DCGs (DCG_11 and _15) [14, 19] . Both cases had p.K656E mutation, and p.V472M mutation was also found in DCG_11. FGFR1 mutation harboring p.K656E, whose biological effect in promoting tumor growth has been demonstrated, has been reported in pediatric diffuse midline glioma H3 K27M-mutant and pilocytic astrocytomas [14, 19, 24] . BRAF mutations, which included the p.V600E mutation in DCG_14, were detected in two cases. PDGFRA extracellular domain mutations, which potentially disrupt ligand interaction, were identified in two cases [38] . Although EGFR mutations were found in two hypermutators (p.E451K in DCG_04 and p.T680M in DCG_17), these mutations were not located at positions where mutation has been frequently observed in GBMs [6] .", "citance": "Activation of PPM1D suppresses p53 function [41, 55] .", "claims": [{"text": "Activation of PPM1D enhances p53 function.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Activation of PPM1D suppresses p53 function.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Many aneuploid cancer cells also have greater-than-diploid DNA content, suggesting that polyploidy is a common precursor to aneuploidy during tumor progression. Polyploid cells can originate from cell fusion, endoreplication, and cytokinesis failure. Recently we found that cell cannibalism by entosis, a form of cell engulfment involving live cells, also leads to polyploidy, as internalized cells disrupt cytokinesis of their engulfing cell hosts. By this mechanism, cannibalistic cell behavior could promote tumor progression by leading to aneuploidy. Here, we discuss cell cannibalism in cancer and other mechanisms that result in the formation of polyploid cancer cells.", "citation_paragraph": "Cell cannibalism has been observed as a phenomenon in mammalian systems for more than 100 years (1) . Unlike phagocytosis, which involves the engulfment of dead or dying cells or pathogenic organisms, cannibalism involves the ingestion of live cells, resulting in the unusual appearance of whole cells contained within large vacuoles, or so-called \"cell-in-cell\" structures. Such cells usually die after they are engulfed, but they can also divide inside of their vacuoles, and some even manage to escape altogether, reemerging as indistinguishable from their unengulfed counterparts (1) . Whereas the various physiologic roles of phagocytosis and the consequences of its dysfunction are clear, by contrast, the roles of live cell engulfments under normal or pathologic conditions are largely unknown (1) . In fact, the first physiologic function for a program of live cell engulfment in mammals was only recently revealed, by the discovery that hepatocytes ingest live autoreactive T cells to block the development of autoimmune disease in mice (2) .Various terms, including cannibalism, emperipolesis, entosis, as well as phagocytosis, have been used to describe live cell engulfments that can occur heterotypically (between cells of different types) or homotypically (between cells of the same type; ref. 1) . Most heterotypic live cell engulfments involve leukocytes ingested into a variety of host cells (epithelial cells, fibroblasts, neural cells, and others). Homotypic live cell engulfment is most often reported between tumor cells, in breast, lung, gallbladder, and gastric carcinoma, as well as metastatic melanoma, malignant mesothelioma, and other cancers (1, 3) .Just as the physiologic roles for most forms of cell cannibalism are unknown, the mechanisms that underlie engulfment are also unclear, as it is the mere appearance of whole, and apparently viable, engulfed cells that is scored as cannibalism, whereas the actual mechanisms of cell uptake have rarely been investigated. In fact, many authors first reporting live cell engulfments speculated that internalized cells were not \"eaten\" at all, but were instead invaders, not unlike some classes of pathogenic organisms (1) . For these authors, it was simply the viability of internalized cells that suggested their active involvement (1) . It is conceivable that cannibalism of leukocytes, for example, is a related activity to endothelial transmigration, as leukocytes can enter actively into individual endothelial cells to exit the blood stream (1) . Accordingly, the internalization of live T cells into hepatocytes is argued to occur by an invasion-like mechanism, referred to as suicidal emperipolesis (2) . Conversely, cells could be cannibalized as passive targets when engulfment pathways are overactive, as in SRGP-1 mutant Caenorhabditis elegans, in which activation of the Rac1 homolog CED-10 leads to the engulfment and killing of viable cells (4) . Similarly, the ingestion of live leukocytes by metastatic melanoma cells is thought to occur by an active engulfment-like activity of the tumor cells, which is dependent on the cytoskeletal linker protein ezrin (5) .Recently, a mode of homotypic cannibalism was reported in which epithelial cells exert autonomous control over their uptake, called entosis (6) . Cannibalism by entosis involves the formation of adherens junctions between epithelial cells, mediated by E-cadherin, followed by engulfment in a RhoGTPase-and Rho-kinase-dependent manner. Rho activity and Rho-kinase are not required within engulfing cells but within internalizing cells, suggesting that uptake is controlled autonomously by an invasion-like mechanism ( Fig. 1A; ref. 6 ).Importantly, cannibalistic cell structures in human breast tumors show clear evidence of a cell-cell adhesion-based mechanism of engulfment, with b-catenin, a component of adherens junctions, at the interface between internalizing cells and their engulfing partners, providing morphologic evidence for entosis as a mechanism underlying the appearance of cell cannibalism in vivo (6) . The entosis mechanism can also account for the appearance of cell-in-cell-in-cell arrangements A B C D E F G Figure 1 . The different mechanisms that lead to polyploidy. A, formation of polyploid cells can result from cytokinesis failure due to entosis; B, cytokinesis failure due to gene dysregulation; C, endoreplication; and, D, cell fusion. In A, cannibalism by entosis requires E-cadherin-mediated junctions (orange) between engulfing cells and their targets, and cell uptake is driven by Rho and Rho-kinase activity within internalizing cells that invade into their hosts (orange arrow). Red arrows indicate the cleavage furrow of dividing cells, which is asymmetric in the presence of an internalized cell in A. E, binucleate or tetraploid cells often form multipolar spindles in mitosis due to increased centrosome number. F, subsequent divisions can be bipolar, but often with merotelic chromosome attachments, resulting in chromosome missegregation. G, multipolar divisions result in gross aneuploidy, which is often lethal but can lead to rare aggressive clones.of successive live engulfments that are observed in human tumors (6, 7) . A mode of heterotypic cannibalism between natural killer (NK) cells and tumor cells was recently reported to involve E-cadherin-mediated cell junctions, as well as ezrin (8) . Like entosis, this form of cell cannibalism is suspected to involve at least some degree of active control by the NK cells over their own uptake, suggesting that entosis-like mechanisms involving cell-cell adhesion proteins may not be restricted to homotypic engulfments (8) .", "citance": "Conversely, cells could be cannibalized as passive targets when engulfment pathways are overactive, as in SRGP-1 mutant Caenorhabditis elegans, in which activation of the Rac1 homolog CED-10 leads to the engulfment and killing of viable cells (4) .", "claims": [{"text": "Activation of the Rac1 homolog CED-10 kills viable cells in SRGP-1 mutant Caenorhabditis elegans.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

The advent of gene cloning has revived experimental embryology. So much so, that we now have a molecular framework for one of the most mysterious problems in developmental biology: how do hundreds (or thousands) of cells in a morphogenetic field communicate to each other their relative positions, so that a perfect identical twin can be formed?The African clawed frog embryo is a favourable biological model because the three main techniques of experimental biology can be applied to it. First, transplantation of cells to a new environment is possible, which allows their full regulatory potential to be challenged. Second, biochemistry with purified proteins can easily be applied in this system, which allows chemical affinities to be determined and components to be quantified in the embryo. Third, the loss of function of individual genes, which can presently be achieved by nongenetic means, can be applied to many genes simultaneously. The beauty of Spemann's Another avenue that is worth exploring is to use computer modelling to understand, in quantitative terms, how a network of proteins that interact with each other selfregulates. The mathematician Alan Turing proposed in 1952 that the formation of stable patterns during development might arise from an activator and an inhibitor that originate from the same source but that diffuse at different rates 51 .

However, each component can be obtained as a pure recombinant protein, its binding affinities determined, and its gene products specifically depleted in the embryo of the African clawed frog.

In this study, a multi-epitope vaccine was constructed by linking cholera toxin B subunit (CTB), two antigenic fragments of H. pylori urease I subunit (UreI20-29, UreI98-107) and four antigenic fragments of H. pylori urease B subunit (UreB12-23, UreB229-251, UreB327-400, UreB515-561), resulting in the recombinant CTB-UreI-UreB (BIB). Its protective effect against H. pylori infection was evaluated in BALB/c mice. Significant protection against H. pylori challenge was achieved in BALB/c mice immunized with BIB (15/18, 83.3%), rIB plus rCTB (6/18, 33.3%) and rIB (2/18, 11.1%) separately, while no protective effect was found in the mice immunized with either adjuvant rCTB alone or PBS. The induction of significant protection against H. pylori is possibly mediated by specific serum IgA and mucosal sIgA antibodies, and a mixed Th1/Th2/Th17 cells response. This multi-epitope vaccine might be a promising vaccine candidate that helps to control H. pylori infection.", "citation_paragraph": "Helicobacter pylori is associated with gastrointestinal illnesses such as chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer, gastric lymphoma and gastric cancer (Strugatsky et al. 2012) . Currently, about half of the Chinese population are infected with H. pylori, most of them don't experience symptoms, but it is causing an increased incidence of gastrointestinal problems in China (Liu, Xie and Cheng 2012) . Based on the available epidemiological evidence, the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer classified H. pylori as a group I carcinogen in 1994 (Wang Yuan and Hunt 2007) . The most used standard treatment consists of two antibiotics and a proton pump inhibitor, sequential therapy or conventional levofloxacin containing quadruple therapy now becomes less successful because of antibiotic resistance (Malfertheiner et al. 2012) . Therefore, this problem combined with high percentage rates of reinfection and low hygiene standards in developing countries makes the production of effective vaccines a high priority (Graham and Fischbach 2010; Czinn and Blanchard 2011; Malfertheiner et al. 2012; Zawahir et al. 2013) . There is not an effective vaccine against H. pylori which was recognized so far, although several vaccine candidates have been tested. Different kinds of vaccines have been formulated aiming at protecting against H. pylori infection, including whole-cell vaccine (Adrian and Chen 1994) , recombinant subunit antigen vaccine (Ar\u00eaas et al. 2004; Liu et al. 2011) and DNA vaccine (Chen et al. 2012 ); however, no major breakthrough has been achieved. Comparing to traditional vaccines, epitope vaccines display many advantages. The most outstanding advantage for an epitope vaccine is that it can avoid the disadvantages of virulence recovery. In addition, an epitope vaccine is non-toxic and stable. Therefore, the epitope vaccine meets the developing direction of future vaccines. Epitope-vaccine design requires epitope screening, the optimization of epitope combination and construction, and assembly of adjuvant factors and epitope stability factors, etc. (Sette and Fikes 2003) . Combining epitopes from special antigens, epitope-based vaccines are designed to induce more specific and potent immune responses than the whole antigens (Sette and Fikes 2003; .Helicobacter pylori can produce a large amount of urease that catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea. The active H. pylori urease has a polymeric structure that comprises two subunits, UreA and UreB (Strugatsky et al. 2012) . UreB is the subunit responsible for enzyme activity, which is critical for the virulence of H. pylori (Zhang et al. 2011) . The antibody against UreB capable of destroying urease activity can protect the stomach from colonization by H. pylori (Fujii et al. 2004; Li et al. 2010; Qiu et al. 2010; . Therefore, an antigenic fragment containing the active center of urease might serve as a good vaccine candidate (Guo et al. 2012b; John et al. 2013) . Another clinical target, the inner membrane protein UreI of H. pylori, which is the protongated inner-membrane urea channel, is a key factor for colonization of H. pylori in acidic mammalian stomach (Strugatsky et al. 2012) .Cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) is the non-toxic portion of cholera toxin (CT) and can bind to the GM1 ganglioside receptor, a glycolipid that is expressed in most cells in human body, including immune cells (Ar\u00eaas et al. 2004) . Coupling the antigen to CTB increased the immunogenicity as it helped receptormediated uptake and subsequent presentation by the antigen presenting cells (APCs) (Guo et al. 2014; Price, McFann and Holmes 2013) .In this study, a multi-epitope vaccine was constructed by linking CTB, two antigenic fragments of H. pylori urease I subunit (UreI 20-29 , UreI 98-107 ) and four antigenic fragments of H. pylori urease B subunit (UreB 12-23 , UreB 229-251 , UreB 327-400 , UreB 515-561 ), resulting in the recombinant CTB-UreI-UreB (BIB).

At sites of infection, endothelial cells capture bypassing neutrophils and guide them through the endothelial cell lining whereby the neutrophils are activated and tuned for the subsequent interaction with microbes. Once in tissues, neutrophils kill microorganisms by microbicidal agents liberated from granules or generated by metabolic activation.

LFA-1 is the principal adhesion molecule on neutrophils that mediates transition from rolling to adhesion on the endothelial cell surface (Phillipson et al., 2006) . Rolling on E-or P-selectin induces the extended, but not high affinity form of LFA-1 (Kuwano et al., 2010) , enabling the LFA-1 to mediate rolling, but not firm adhesion, to ICAM-1. This activation of LFA-1 is induced by signals from PSGL-1 and CD44 (Zarbock et al., 2008; Yago et al., 2010) . Full LFA-1 activation is mediated by activation of the chemokine receptors on neutrophils (Zarbock et al., 2007) , which pick up ligands secreted by endothelial cells or presented by the endothelial cell glycosaminoglycans or by the Duffy antigen-receptor for chemokines as discussed in Middleton et al.

KRAS is mutated in 95% of PDACs and is a well-validated driver of PDAC growth and maintenance. However, despite comprehensive efforts, an effective anti-RAS drug has yet to reach the clinic. Different paths to inhibiting RAS signaling are currently under investigation in the hope of finding a successful treatment. Recently, direct RAS binding molecules have been discovered, challenging the perception that RAS is an \"undruggable\" protein. Other strategies currently being pursued take an indirect approach, targeting proteins that facilitate RAS membrane association or downstream effector signaling. Unbiased genetic screens have identified synthetic lethal interactors of mutant RAS. Most recently, metabolic targets in pathways related to glycolytic signaling, glutamine utilization, autophagy, and macropinocytosis are also being explored. Harnessing the patient's immune system to fight their cancer is an additional exciting route that is being considered. The \"best\" path to inhibiting KRAS has yet to be determined, with each having promise as well as potential pitfalls. We will summarize the state-of-the-art for each direction, focusing on efforts directed toward the development of therapeutics for pancreatic cancer patients with mutated KRAS.", "citation_paragraph": "Synthetic lethality arises when a combination of mutations in two or more genes leads to cell death. Thus, synthetic lethal interactors of mutant RAS would be genes for which the loss of function would be lethal to the cell only in the presence of mutant RAS. The existence of oncogene-specific synthetic lethal interactions is supported by the notion that oncogenic transformation profoundly changes the phenotype of the cell [60, 61] . Potential targets may exist is pathways that aid the RAS-transformed cell in coping with the cellular stress associated with persistent proliferation or the nutrient-supply pathways that fuel this proliferation. Several studies have identified synthetic lethal interactors with mutant KRAS through the use of RNAi screens in human cancer cell lines [62] ; unfortunately, this first generation of screens yielded only new information about the biology of mutant KRAS-harboring cells, not new therapeutic targets.The hits from screens for synthetic lethal interactors for mutant KRAS span many different cellular processes including: Cell cycle/mitosis, cell survival, gene transcription, and cell growth. Therapeutically, targeting cell cycle regulators such as survivin, CDK1 [63] , or TPX2 [64] would most likely be similarly toxic to normal and neoplastic cells. Additionally, transcription factors such as GATA2 [65, 66] are largely considered undruggable. A potentially druggable hit, serine/threonine protein kinase 33 (STK33), was initially considered a tractable target [67] ; however, follow-up studies have determined that both genetic depletion and pharmacological inhibition of STK33 has no effect on cell growth [68] . Likewise, genetic and pharmacological validation of the hit TBK1 [69] found no reproducible requirement for TBK1 in the growth of KRAS-mutant tumor cell lines in vitro [70] .There were a number of limitations with the first generation of mutant KRAS synthetic lethal screens that could be improved upon in future studies. First, many of these screens relied on isogenic matched pairs of cells lines harboring KRAS mutations, and a matched counterpart in which the KRAS allele is genetically ablated. Acute ablation of KRAS causes apoptosis and severe growth impairment [71] , and thus proliferating cells that eventually arise must acquire additional, adaptive alterations and are therefore not truly isogenic. Currently, efforts are underway to screen large panels of cancer cell lines that are more representative of the heterogeneity that exists in human KRAS-mutant cancers. Additionally, all previously described screens have utilized in vitro anchorage-dependent culture conditions. Second generation screens would benefit from anchorage-independent culture systems, such as organoid cultures or in vivo xenograft tumor assays, which more accurately model tumor biology. Such methods have already been utilized in screens for other purposes [72] [73] [74] . Furthermore, the first generation screens serve as a reminder that as with any high-throughput approach, hits must be rigorously validated.", "citance": "Acute ablation of KRAS causes apoptosis and severe growth impairment [71] , and thus proliferating cells that eventually arise must acquire additional, adaptive alterations and are therefore not truly isogenic.", "claims": [{"text": "Acute ablation of KRAS causes apoptosis.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Acute ablation of KRAS causes severe growth impairment.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 15358930, "title": "The Snail Transcription Factor Regulates the Numbers of Neural Precursor Cells and Newborn Neurons throughout Mammalian Life", "abstract": "The Snail transcription factor regulates diverse aspects of stem cell biology in organisms ranging from Drosophila to mammals. Here we have asked whether it regulates the biology of neural precursor cells (NPCs) in the forebrain of postnatal and adult mice, taking advantage of a mouse containing a floxed Snail allele (Snailfl/fl mice). We show that when Snail is inducibly ablated in the embryonic cortex, this has long-term consequences for cortical organization. In particular, when Snailfl/fl mice are crossed to Nestin-cre mice that express Cre recombinase in embryonic neural precursors, this causes inducible ablation of Snail expression throughout the postnatal cortex. This loss of Snail causes a decrease in proliferation of neonatal cortical neural precursors and mislocalization and misspecification of cortical neurons. Moreover, these precursor phenotypes persist into adulthood. Adult neural precursor cell proliferation is decreased in the forebrain subventricular zone and in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, and this is coincident with a decrease in the number of adult-born olfactory and hippocampal neurons. Thus, Snail is a key regulator of the numbers of neural precursors and newborn neurons throughout life.", "citation_paragraph": "The molecular mechanisms that regulate the number of neural precursor cells in the developing and adult brain are just now being elucidated. Data presented here address these mechanisms, and in so doing, define a role for the transcription factor Snail in neural precursor biology throughout life. In particular, work reported here using a conditional Snail knockout mouse model supports three major conclusions. First, data obtained with this mouse model confirms our previous acute shRNA-mediated Snail knockdowns [20] , and show that acute ablation of Snail in the embryonic cortex altered the survival, proliferation and number of embryonic cortical precursors. Second, our data indicate that genetic loss of Snail in the postnatal brain caused deficits in postnatal cortical precursor proliferation, and neuronal perturbations, including an increase in cortical layer VI Tbr1-positive excitatory neurons, and a coincident decrease in, and mislocalization of Satb2-positive excitatory neurons. Third, our data indicate that Snail plays a similar role in adult NPCs. Specifically, in both the forebrain SVZ and the hippocampal SGZ, genetic ablation of Snail caused decreased precursor proliferation and numbers, and decreased numbers of adult-born olfactory bulb and dentate gyrus neurons. These findings indicate that Snail plays a general role in regulating neural precursor numbers throughout life, and provide support for the idea that many neural precursor regulatory mechanisms are evolutionarily conserved from model organisms like Drosophila through to mammals.One major conclusion of this work is that Snail regulates neural precursor numbers throughout life by regulating their proliferation. This conclusion adds to an increasing body of evidence suggesting that many of the molecular mechanisms that regulate embryonic radial precursors also regulate their adult SVZ neural stem cell progeny (for example, see [3, 4, [6] [7] [8] ). How then does Snail do this? Clues to the underlying mechanisms come from our recent work knocking down Snail in embryonic radial precursors using an acute shRNA-mediated approach [21] . In this study we showed, as observed here in the embryonic Snail fl/fl cortex, that when Snail levels were decreased, this caused increased death of cortical precursors, a robust decrease in radial precursor proliferation, and a resultant decrease in all of the cell types in the embryonic cortex. That study also showed that Snail regulates embryonic radial precursor survival via the tumor suppressor p53 and proliferation via the cell cycle phosphatase cdc25b. We posit that Snail likely regulates adult neural precursor biology via the same targets, since p53 has previously been implicated in adult SVZ neural precursor survival and proliferation [8, 32, 33] , and cdc25 has previously been shown to regulate the cell cycle in adult dentate gyrus precursors under pathological conditions [34] .In addition to these neural precursor phenotypes, we also document robust neuronal phenotypes following genetic ablation of Snail, including neuronal mislocalization, neuronal misspecification and decreased neuronal numbers. With regard to neuronal mislocalization, we have confirmed our previous data showing that newborn embryonic neurons were aberrantly localized following acute genetic ablation of Snail [21] . More importantly, the BrdU birthdating studies in Snail fl/fl mice that are presented here show that Satb2-positive neurons born at or after E13/14 were mispositioned in deeper cortical layers at P7 in the Snail fl/ fl ;nestin-Cre mice. At both of these developmental timepoints, Satb2-positive neurons were located closer to the SVZ than they would be normally, suggesting that their migration was in some way impaired. This aberrant neuronal localization suggests a role for Snail in neuronal migration, a role it plays in other cell types [35] . Intriguingly, a recent study showed that the Snail superfamily member Scratch regulates delamination and migration of embryonic cortical neurons by transcriptionally regulating expression of E-cadherin [22] . Since Snail also regulates E-cadherin transcription [36] , then this would provide a potential molecular mechanism to explain this phenotype. However, this interpretation is complicated by the fact that newborn cortical neurons migrate along the basal processes of radial precursor cells, and radial precursors are also perturbed when Snail is geneticallyablated.With regard to neuronal misspecification, in the postnatal cortex of Snail fl/fl ;nestin-cre mice the proportion of Tbr1-positive deep layer neurons was increased from 10 to 20%, while Satb2-positive neurons were decreased by a corresponding 10%. What is the explanation for this misspecification? One potential explanation is that newborn cortical neurons became misspecified as a consequence of their mislocalization. Precedent for this model comes from embryonic studies showing that when developing cortical precursors/neurons were transplanted into inappropriate cortical layers, they had the capacity to adopt aspects of the neuronal phenotype appropriate to their new location (for example, see [37, 38] ). Thus, in our study, if neurons that would normally become upper-layer Satb2-positive neurons ended up instead in layer VI because they did not migrate appropriately, then perhaps they would adopt a layer VI Tbr1-positive neuronal phenotype, thereby explaining the increase in one and concomitant decrease in the other. Alternatively, this misspecification could be caused by a Snail-regulated shift in the ratio of radial precursors to intermediate progenitors. In particular, data presented here and in our previous study show that decreased levels of Snail cause a preferential decrease in the number of intermediate progenitors, thereby potentially leading to an increased relative proportion of radial precursors. Since deep layer neurons are predominantly generated directly by radial precursors while later-born, more superficial neurons are largely generated by intermediate progenitors [39] , then a relative increase in radial precursors might result in an increased relative proportion of deeper-layer neurons, as we report here.One final neuronal phenotype that occurred when Snail was genetically ablated was a decreased number of adult-born neurons. A key question is whether this is a consequence of deficits in adult neural precursors, or whether it might also be due to a requirement for Snail in the neurons themselves. In our previous study we showed that Snail knockdown led to death of both precursors and neurons in the embryonic cortex, and that this occurred in a p53-dependent fashion. Since p53 activation can cause apoptosis of adult-born neurons in a PUMA-dependent fashion [8] , and since the Snail family can repress an apoptotic p53-PUMA-dependent pathway in other mammalian cell types [40, 41] , then it is possible that Snail is important for survival of newborn neurons, whether they are generated in the adult or in the embryo. However, defining a direct effect on neuronal survival will require manipulation of Snail in a neuron-specific fashion.In summary, our findings define a role for Snail in the regulation of mammalian neural precursor biology throughout life. In all of these different developmental contexts, Snail regulates the proliferation and number of neural precursors, and coincidently determines the number, positioning and phenotype of newborn neurons. These findings define a transcriptional regulator that plays a key role in mammalian neural development, and contribute to the growing concept that many of the molecular factors that control behavior of neural stem cells are conserved from Drosophila to mammals [11] [12] [13] [14] .", "citance": "First, data obtained with this mouse model confirms our previous acute shRNA-mediated Snail knockdowns [20] , and show that acute ablation of Snail in the embryonic cortex altered the survival, proliferation and number of embryonic cortical precursors.", "claims": [{"text": "Acute ablation of Snail in the embryonic cortex affects the proliferation and number of embryonic cortical precursors.", "subject": "ablation of Snai", "is_negation": false}]}

The search for mechanisms and therapeutic solutions to alter neurogenesis requires understanding of cell kinetics within neurogenic niches using a high-throughput quantitative approach. The challenge is in the dynamic nature of the process and multiple cell types involved, each having several potential modes of division or cell fate. Here we show that cell kinetics can be revealed through a combination of the BrdU/EdU pulse-chase, based on the circadian pattern of DNA replication, and a differential equations model that describes time-dependent cell densities. The model is validated through the analysis of cell kinetics in the cerebellar neurogenic niche of normal young adult male zebrafish, with cells quantified in 2D (sections), and with neuronal fate and reactivation of stem cells confirmed in 3D whole-brain images (CLARITY). We then reveal complex alterations in cell kinetics associated with accelerated aging due to chronic high caloric intake. Low activity of neuronal stem cells in this condition persists 2 months after reverting to normal diet, and is accompanied by overproduction of transient amplifying cells, their accelerated cell death, and slow migration of postmitotic progeny. This combined experimental and mathematical approach should allow for relatively high-throughput analysis of early signs of pathological and age-related changes in neurogenesis, evaluation of specific therapeutic targets, and drug efficacy.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Understanding normal cell kinetics of adult neurogenesis and the type of cells affected by a pathological process is needed to develop effective prophylactic and therapeutic measures directed at specific cell targets. Complex time-dependent mechanisms involved in the kinetics of multiple cell types require a combination of experimental and mathematical modeling approaches. This study demonstrates such a combined approach by comparing normal neurogenesis with that altered by diet-induced accelerated aging in adult zebrafish.", "citation_paragraph": "Adult neurogenesis is a dynamic and highly controlled process that adds new functional neurons to a mature CNS (for review, see Bond et al., 2015) . Changes in cell kinetics in a neurogenic niche can interfere with normal maintenance of brain tissue and prevent compensatory mechanisms from counteracting neurodegeneration, brain repair after trauma, or stroke. Such changes can range from increased quiescence or cell death to alternative modes of division, altered migration, or inability to incorporate into preexisting neural networks. Finding ways to promote adult neurogenesis through prophylactics or treatment requires understanding of which cells and at which stage of a disease are at the core of the problem, and thus could serve as an effective drug target. A combination of high-throughput experimental techniques, animal models with active neurogenesis, and mathematical modeling can reveal the specific changes in cell kinetics and identify those factors that interfere with adult neurogenesis.Neurogenesis declines with age in all vertebrate species studied, including fish (Edelmann et al., 2013) , rodents (Seki and Arai, 1995; Kuhn et al., 1996; Kempermann et al., 1998) , nonhuman primates (Gould et al., 1999) , and humans (Eriksson et al., 1998; Spalding et al., 2013; Bergmann et al., 2015) . This area of research is of great significance, but of great uncertainty as well. Genetically determined differences in constitutive or reactive neurogenesis may, in part, explain high interindividual variability in cognitive dysfunctions with age, including neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. However, more research is needed to test these hypotheses, in view of other diverse factors, including environmental agents, stress or altered circadian rhythmicity facilitating brain aging, and increasing probability of disease states (Guarente, 2014; Chin-Chan et al., 2015; Musiek et al., 2015; Liguori et al., 2018) .Metabolic abnormalities, including those associated with diabetes or obesity, appear to have some of the most powerful effects on the aging process (Thorpe and Ferraro, 2004; Haslam and James, 2005; Barbagallo and Dominguez, 2014; Bonomini et al., 2015) . Hyperglycemia can alter neurogenesis (Dorsemans et al., 2017a) and contribute to the development of neurodegeneration and neurodegenerative diseases (Cai, 2013) . Our recent study implicates a chronic life-long high caloric intake (HCI) in leading young adult zebrafish to develop a premature aging phenotype . Apart from the shortened lifespan, these animals develop early scoliosis, sleep abnormalities, and compromised circadian patterns of behavior. Importantly, accelerated aging in these fish is associated with a remarkably low cell proliferation in the brain. To better understand this phenomenon and develop a relatively high-throughput methodology of characterizing cell kinetics within neurogenic niches of an adult brain under normal and pathological conditions, we combined the experimental and mathematical model approaches.Here we show an orderly cell kinetics pattern of adult neurogenesis in young healthy zebrafish brain and its alterations in HCI fish. Those include high day-to-day variability in cell proliferation, low numbers of both neuronal stem cells (NSCs), which divide infrequently, and transient neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs), which make several consecutive divisions. Additionally, HCI leads to changes in the predominant mode of NPC division and their short lifespan, with slow migration of their postmitotic progeny. Together, these results demonstrate that chronic HCI interferes with adult neurogenesis on several levels, and that mathematical modeling can provide needed insights into normal neurogenesis and changes associated with a pathological process, and predict their outcomes.", "citance": "Adult neurogenesis is a dynamic and highly controlled process that adds new functional neurons to a mature CNS (for review, see Bond et al., 2015) .", "claims": [{"text": "Adult neurogenesis adds new functional neurons to a mature central nervous system.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Importantly, the rates of these diseases are projected to rise substantially in coming years due to increased life expectancies, sedentary lifestyles, and the ongoing obesity epidemic. IL-1 can affect various aspects of bone and joint integrity, and as a result IL-1 is critically involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), periodontal disease, osteoarthritis, and gout (Walsh et al., 2006; Takayanagi, 2007; Jones et al., 2011) . For instance, IL-1 stimulates bone resorption bone by directly impinging on osteoclast and osteoblast functions (Nguyen et al., 1991; Kwan Tat et al., 2004) . On the other hand, IL-1 signaling contributes to cartilage deterioration by impairing chondrocyte proteoglycan synthesis and stimulating the production of joint damaging mediators such as matrix metalloproteinases and nitric oxide (Joosten et al., 2004; Zwerina et al., 2007) . In the case of RA, insufficient levels of the naturally occurring IL-1R antagonist in the synovium are associated with joint pathology (Firestein et al., 1994) . Treatment of RA with IL-1 pathway inhibitors has achieved moderate clinical success and is currently prescribed to limit the progression of joint damage in individuals with moderate to severe RA (Arend et al., 1998; Bresnihan et al., 1998) . Similar to RA, dysregulated IL-1-mediated events also impinge on the development of osteoarthritis; however, therapeutic targeting of IL-1 has only provided modest improvements in clinical trials (Chevalier et al., 2009) .Gout and pseudogout are sterile inflammatory disorders that occur when monosodium urate (MSU) or calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals, respectively, deposit in the joints and periarticular tissue. These crystalline agents cause aggravated inflammation and neutrophil recruitment that can result in bone and joint damage. This sterile inflammatory response is dependent on NLRP3 inflammasome activation both in vitro and in vivo (Martinon et al., 2006) . Moreover, colchicine, which is commonly used to treat gout and pseudogout, was found to dampen inflammasome-triggered IL-1\u03b2 production. Currently, inhibition of crystal uptake is targeted to treat gout, however, this recent data suggests that addition of IL-1R blockade could substantially improve current therapeutics.Excessive Th1-and Th17-mediated inflammatory responses have traditionally been associated with joint destruction, especially in the case of arthritis. IL-33 has been extensively shown to potently induce Th2-driven inflammation, and thus it came as a great surprise that the absence of IL-33-mediated signaling results in attenuated joint disease . Appreciable levels of IL-33 and ST2 can be detected in the synovium of RA patients (Carriere et al., 2007; Palmer et al., 2009) . Furthermore, the disruption of ST2 activation, either by genetic abrogation or antibody-induced blockade, resulted in decreased joint disease in the mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA; Xu et al., 2008; Palmer et al., 2009 ). The lack of functional ST2 contributed to protection in this model through the dampening of inflammatory cytokine and anti-collagen antibody production. In contrast, treatment of CIA-induced mice with exogenous IL-33 at the onset of disease resulted in exacerbated joint destruction. Expression of ST2 on mast cells was shown to be critical for disease pathology in the CIA model, thus suggesting a critical role for IL-33-mediated activation of mast cells in joint disease .", "citance": "This sterile inflammatory response is dependent on NLRP3 inflammasome activation both in vitro and in vivo (Martinon et al., 2006) .", "claims": [{"text": "Aggravated inflammation is dependent on NLRP3 inflammasome activation.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Neutrophil recruitment is dependent on NLRP3 inflammasome activation.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Patient-derived hiPSCs are also used for in vitro disease modeling and drug screenings. Several studies focused on the identification of DNA mutations generated, or selected, during the derivation of hiPSCs, some of which are known to drive cancer formation. Avoiding such stable genomic aberrations is paramount for successful use of hiPSCs, but it is equally important to ensure that their epigenetic information is correct, given the critical role of epigenetics in transcriptional regulation and its involvement in a plethora of pathologic conditions. In this review we will focus on genomic imprinting, a prototypical epigenetic mechanism whereby a gene is expressed in a parent-of-origin specific manner, thanks to the differential methylation of specific DNA sequences. Conventional hiPSCs are thought to be in a pluripotent state primed for differentiation. They display a hypermethylated genome with an unexpected loss of DNA methylation at imprinted loci. Several groups recently reported the generation of hiPSCs in a more primitive developmental stage, called na\u00efve pluripotency. Na\u00efve hiPSCs share several features with early human embryos, such as a global genome hypomethylation, which is also accompanied by a widespread loss of DNA methylation at imprinted loci. Given that loss of imprinting has been observed in genetic developmental disorders as well as in a wide range of cancers, it is fundamental to make sure that hiPSCs do not show such epigenetic aberrations. We will discuss what specific imprinted genes, associated with human pathologies, have been found commonly misregulated in hiPSCs and suggest strategies to effectively detect and avoid such undesirable epigenetic abnormalities.", "citation_paragraph": "Reprogrammed cells could retain some chromatin marks belonging to the source cell (somatic memory), causing the insufficient silencing of lineage-specific genes or the negative regulation of pluripotency genes (Figure 2) , limiting their differentiation into lineages other than the one of the source cells (Marchetto et al., 2009; Ghosh et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2010 Kim et al., , 2011 Bar-Nur et al., 2011; Horvath, 2013 , reviewed in Vaskova et al., 2013 .Older cells are more resistant to complete reprogramming (Sardo et al., 2016) , probably because of the accumulation of age dependent methylation at specific loci. Aging is usually accompanied by a gradual and genome wide loss of DNA methylation (Booth and Brunet, 2016) , that exposes aged individuals to a higher risk of cancer due to the consequential increased risk of accumulating genomic aberrations. Despite this, some CpG islands and gene-rich regions become hypermethylated with age. These loci displaying age-dependent DNA hypermethylation are preferentially near tissue-specific genes, genes involved in differentiation and development, genes encoding transcription factors, and transcription factor binding sites (Benayoun et al., 2015) . Some of the age dependent CpGs or the somatic CpGs remain methylated even after the reprogramming process (Lister et al., 2011; Ohi et al., 2011; Sardo et al., 2016) leaving an epigenetic signature of age or of somatic origin in the hiPSCs (Figure 2 ). These regions are associated with alterations on histone modifications patterns and consequential difference on gene expression and are transmitted FIGURE 2 | Epigenome resetting during reprogramming -Pluripotency promoters have to be demethylated, while somatic cell specific promoters have to be methylated for successful reprogramming to occur.

The conceptual framework revolves around objectives, inputs, processes, outputs, outcomes, and impacts showing the theoretical linkages between the delivery of the interventions targeting these diseases through various community delivery platforms and the consequent health impacts. We also describe the methodology undertaken to conduct the systematic reviews and the meta-analyses.", "citation_paragraph": "To break the cycle of infections, health promotion and preventive interventions are critical. Since many of these diseases are vector borne or transmitted through poor sanitation and hygiene conditions, they can be averted if effective preventive measures are in place. For effective control of dengue, chagas, human African trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, dracunculiasis, LF, onchocerciasis and schistosomiasis, vector control mainly relies on insecticides. An effective sanitation infrastructure is ideal for interrupting the transmission of many diseases, however, the resources are limited and not sustainable in developing countries [21] . Preventive chemotherapy is the most feasible and cost-effective measure as safe and effective drugs exist [22, 23] . Programs to control NTDs predominantly employ MDA to treat high-risk population [24] and WHO endorses this strategy as 'preventative chemotherapy' [25] . For some of these diseases, chemotherapy is common and can be administered concurrently, for example, ABZ is given to treat LF and STH, while ivermectin (IVR) can be given for both LF and onchocerciasis [26] . Other preventive strategies involve community-based vector control measures such as insecticide spraying and ITNs for dengue, chagas, and leishmaniasis.Of the various measures in place for malaria prevention, key interventions include indoor residual spraying (IRS), use of ITNs, intermittent preventive therapy (IPT), presumptive treatment, and mass awareness. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the wide-scale implementation of ITNs is now one of the main strategies to reduce malaria morbidity and mortality [27] . The ITNs have the potential to hugely affect the spread of this disease, and their use has been associated with reduced mortality among children [28] [29] [30] . The WHO also recommends IPT for pregnant women and infants in highly endemic areas.For HIV prevention, interventions must involve behavioral changes to reduce HIV risk and promote awareness about condom use, safe sex practices, voluntary testing and counseling, and voluntary male circumcision. Couples counseling and condom distribution have proven effective in many countries such as Kenya and Zambia, however, many countries still lack a comprehensive strategy for rolling out these programmatic approaches [19] .", "citance": "For some of these diseases, chemotherapy is common and can be administered concurrently, for example, ABZ is given to treat LF and STH, while ivermectin (IVR) can be given for both LF and onchocerciasis [26] .", "claims": [{"text": "Albendazole is used to treat lymphatic filariasis.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Albendazole is used to treat soil-transmitted helminths.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Ivermectin is used to treat lymphatic filariasis.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Ivermectin is used to treat onchocerciasis.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

The current study aims to: i) determine whether homicide victims who were residents of wet counties had higher odds of testing positive for alcohol than their counterparts in moist or dry counties after adjusting for confounders; ii) determine whether homicides and alcohol-related homicides tend to cluster spatially; iii) determine whether the aforementioned associations exist only in highly-populated counties. A multilevel logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the data on homicide victims in the Kentucky Violent Death Reporting System from 2005 to 2012. Spatial statistics were used to determine the spatial autocorrelation in rates of homicides and alcohol-related homicides. Overall, 944 homicide victims were included. The male to female ratio was 3:1. About 32.8% of homicide victims tested positive for alcohol. About 33.0% of homicide decedents who were residents in wet counties tested positive for alcohol compared to 32.5% of their counterparts in moist/dry counties. Residence in wet counties was associated with a statistically insignificant increase in the unadjusted odds ratio (OR) of alcohol-related homicide victimization (OR=1.20, 95% CI=0.81-1.77) as well as the adjusted odds (aOR=1.33, 95% CI=0.83-2.12). There was no association between population size and alcohol-related homicide rate.", "citation_paragraph": "Homicide is among the top ten leading causes of death in adults in the United States (Logan et al., 2011; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014) and alcohol consumption together with homicide victimization is a major public health problem (Grucza et al., 2012) . Prior studies of homicide victimization and alcohol show that alcohol was present in about 50% of homicide victims (Darke, 2010; Kuhns and Maguire, 2012) . Among the various causes of violent deaths that occurred In the state of Kentucky between 2005 and 2010 (Walsh et al., 2009) , homicide was the second most common (22%). Several countries have implemented policies limiting alcohol use to reduce alcohol-related harms, such as suicide, homicide, other violent crimes and vehicle accidents. Such policies included banning alcohol sales, limiting number of alcohol outlets (Branas et al., 2011; Parker et al., 2011; Jennings et al., 2014; Giesbrecht et al., 2015) , applying high alcohol taxes (Zeoli and Webster, 2010) , limiting hours of alcohol sales (Duailibi et al., 2007; Malaga et al., 2012) , limiting days of alcohol sales (Middleton et al., 2010; Heaton, 2012) , setting a maximum blood alcohol level when driving (Grucza et al., 2012) and limiting age when drinking is allowed (Grucza et al., 2012) . Results from studies on the effect of the aforementioned policies on reducing homicide victimization are conflicting. For example, one of the earliest policies restricting alcohol in the United States is the constitutional prohibition of alcohol in 1920 (Asbridge and Weerasinghe, 2009) . A study on the effect of the enactment of this policy employed an interrupted time series of 11,018 homicide victims and offenders in Chicago between 1870 and 1930 found no change in the alcohol-related homicide rates, a 21% increase in total homicides and an 11% increase in the nonalcohol-related homicides (Asbridge and Weerasinghe, 2009) . They attributed the absence of change in alcohol-related homicide rates to underestimation, or possibly that the prohibition was not sufficiently enforced to effectively stop people from drinking. The rise in total and non-alcohol-related homicides was explained by a possible black market, organized crime and the existence of a subculture of violence at that time (Asbridge and Weerasinghe, 2009) . Several questions remain unanswered in that study due to lack of data. For example, did the prohibition impact the economy by increasing the unemployment rate and poverty lead to violence? Alternatively, was the prohibition associated with the emergence of other substance-N o n -c o m m e r c i a l u s e o n l y abuse activities leading to violence? On the other hand, a prior study of alcohol availability and homicides found that an increase in alcohol sales was associated with an increase of homicides rates in men only, which suggests that both alcohol and violence are more common in men (Ray et al., 2008) . Similarly, another study of the association between the number of on-premise violent crimes in Kansas showed that a 10% increase in drinking establishments was associated with a 3.7% to 4.1% increase in violent crime suggesting that alcohol might act as a catalyst for violent behaviours (Anderson et al., 2014) . A major limitation of the prior studies is the ecologic fallacy, which means that results cannot be generalized to individuals.Kentucky has diverse and continuously changing alcohol laws that result in an intermingled combination of wet counties (32), moist (49) and dry ones (39). Dry counties are counties that prohibit all sale of alcoholic beverages, wet counties those that permit full retail sales of alcohol under state license whereas moist counties are those with a wet city in a dry county or which only allow sale of alcohol at select sites, such as historic sites. The classification is not strict and moist cities can be in dry counties and vice versa (Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, 2015) . To date, there is no study of the association between the alcohol sale status of decedents' residence and homicide victims testing positive for alcohol in Kentucky. In this study, we used the term alcohol-related homicide to refer to victims testing positive for alcohol, not perpetrators. The current study aims to determine: i) whether homicide victims who are residents of wet counties have higher odds of testing positive for alcohol post mortem than homicide victims who are residents of moist/dry counties, after adjusting for confounding factors; ii) whether there is spatial autocorrelation among homicide and/or alcohol-related homicide rates in wet counties; and iii) whether the association between alcohol sale status of a decedents' residence and being an alcohol-related homicide victim exists primarily in counties with high populations.", "citance": "On the other hand, a prior study of alcohol availability and homicides found that an increase in alcohol sales was associated with an increase of homicides rates in men only, which suggests that both alcohol and violence are more common in men (Ray et al., 2008) .", "claims": [{"text": "Alcohol and violence are more common in men than in women.", "subject": "Alcohol and violence ", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Alcohol and violence are more common in women than in men.", "subject": "Alcohol and violence ", "is_negation": true}]}
{"s2orc_id": 18767394, "title": "Giving Back: A mixed methods study of the contributions of US-Based Nigerian physicians to home country health systems", "abstract": "BACKGROUND There is increased interest in the capacity of US immigrants to contribute to their homelands via entrepreneurship and philanthropy. However, there has been little research examining how immigrant physicians may support health systems and what factors facilitate or raise barriers to increased support.   METHODS This study used an observational design with paper questionnaire and interview components. Our sample was drawn from attendees of a 2011 conference for US Based Nigerian physicians; respondents who were not US residents, physicians, and of Nigerian birth or parentage were excluded from further analysis. Respondents were randomly selected to complete a follow-up interview with separate scripts for those having made past financial contributions or medical service trips to support Nigerian healthcare (Group A) and those who had done neither (Group B). Survey results were analyzed using Fischer exact tests and interviews were coded in pairs using thematic content analysis.   RESULTS Seventy-five of 156 (48 %) individuals who attended the conference met inclusion criteria and completed the survey, and 13 follow-up interviews were completed. In surveys, 65 % percent of respondents indicated a donation to an agency providing healthcare in Nigeria the previous year, 57 % indicated having gone on medical service trips in the prior 10 years and 45 % indicated it was \"very likely\" or \"likely\" that they would return to Nigeria to practice medicine. In interviews, respondents tended to favor gifts in kind and financial gifts as modes of contribution, with medical education facilities as the most popular target. Personal connections, often forged in medical school, tended to facilitate contributions. Individuals desiring to return permanently focused on their potential impact and worried about health system under-preparedness; those not desiring permanent return centered on how safety, financial security and health systems issues presented barriers.   CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates several mechanisms by which health systems may benefit from expatriate engagement. Greater identification of reliable local partners for diaspora, deeper collaboration with those partners and a focus on sustainable interventions might improve the quantity and impact of contributions. Ethnic medical associations have a unique role in organizing and facilitating diaspora response. Public-private partnerships may help diaspora negotiate the challenges of repatriation.", "citation_paragraph": "There is a significant gap in resourcing for health systems in many low and middle income countries (LMICs). In 2009 a World Bank/UNICEF/UNFPA report estimated that $68.9 billion dollars needed to be invested in LMIC health systems in order to ensure the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) [1] . In terms of human resources, an estimated gap of 2.4 million physicians, nurses, and midwives has prevented achievement of the MDGs, 84 % of which is accounted by Africa and Southeast Asia [2] .As of 2010, there were an estimated 265,851 physicians in the United States (US) who have received their education in other nations, 128,729 of whom came from low income countries [3] . Home country health systems have suffered from the gap left by emigrated health professionals. This was most crystallized right before the recent Ebola epidemic in Liberia, where more than 50 % of nationally trained physicians were practicing overseas as of 2004 [4] , and the nation had only 51 physicians in 2014 to care for 5 million individuals [5] . Other studies have demonstrated an increase in HIV mortality related to physician emigration [6] .Conversely, home country health systems may potentially benefit from the involvement of \"diaspora\" (i.e. emigrated) health professionals. Unfortunately very little research has attempted to understand the level, impact, or factors related with diaspora contributions towards home country healthcare. Case studies have attempted to measure the work of individuals or collective single contributions such as humanitarian trips [7] [8] [9] . One study has examined the philanthropy of Zimbabwean physicians but was focused largely on remittances and family directed gifts in kind [10] . (Research into philanthropy by nonmedical diaspora, on the other hand, is by no means new. Although the large majority of literature focuses on the economic impact of remittances on development, there has been growing recognition of the capacity of diaspora to contribute and volunteer directly to social and humanitarian causes [7, [11] [12] [13] [14] ).The literature on permanent return by health workers is slightly more expansive, but still inconclusive. Existing studies on Peruvian and Pacific Islander returnees identify remigration related \"pull\" factors of family and potential impact in their home country, while lost potential earnings and bureaucracy at home raise barriers to return and retention [15] [16] [17] . India is believed to have experienced increased return migration of health workers (due in part to improved economic opportunities), and a number of encouraging studies have investigated the return of nurses to their homeland [18] . On the other hand, some studies suggest that permanent return is unlikely for the majority of physicians [19, 20] . One study of South African physician \u00e9mi-gr\u00e9s in Canada echoed a resounding disinclination towards return-or any type of post-emigration engagement [21] .Given the significant needs of LMIC health systems and the recorded willingness of diaspora to contribute generally, there is need for greater research to examine the involvement of diaspora health workers in origin country health systems. With 3271 physicians, Nigerians constituted the largest component of sub-Saharan Africa-trained physicians in the United States in 2011 (equaling 44 % of all subSaharan Africa trained physicians in the US) [22] . The following study takes a mixed methods approach composed of a questionnaire and follow-up interviews to determine the capacity in which a group of US-based Nigerian physicians support Nigerian health, including (but not limited to) financial contributions, medical service trips, and permanent return. Our principal hypotheses were that USBased Nigerian physicians with strong relationships with Nigerian medical institutions (exhibited by correspondence frequency) and a strong belief in their effectiveness as practitioners would be more likely to contribute via donations and medical service trips while physicians with family members in Nigeria would exhibit a stronger desire to relocate to Nigeria to practice medicine.", "citance": "With 3271 physicians, Nigerians constituted the largest component of sub-Saharan Africa-trained physicians in the United States in 2011 (equaling 44 % of all subSaharan Africa trained physicians in the US) [22] .", "claims": [{"text": "Algerian physicians constitue the largest component of sub-Saharan Africa-trained physicians in the United States.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Nigerian physicians constitue the largest component of sub-Saharan Africa-trained physicians in the United States.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

A growing body of evidence demonstrates that HTN is both underdiagnosed and undertreated in this population. The consequences of untreated HTN include adverse effects on CKD progression, markers of cardiovascular morbidity, and neurocognitive functioning. Consensus guidelines issued over the past decade have incorporated recent research on the consequences of HTN in recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of HTN in pediatric CKD and include lower BP targets. Agents which target the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) should be considered first-line therapy in CKD-associated HTN in children, though multiple medications may be required to achieve sufficient BP control.", "citation_paragraph": "Until recently, there were very few antihypertensive medications whose safety and efficacy had been studied specifically in children. Since passage of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (1997) and Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (2002) in the USA, enough data has been generated for most classes of antihypertensive medications to permit approval and labeling for pediatric use. What is still lacking, however, are comparative prospective trials demonstrating superiority of one particular class of agent over another. Consensus guidelines currently recommend treating with a single agent to maximum dose, then adding additional agents if additional BP control is needed [10] . Based on physiologic mechanism and available data from both clinical trials and observational studies, agents that act on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) are currently recommended as first-line therapy for HTN in children with CKD [51, 52] . This approach is supported by data from the CKiD study, which demonstrated that children receiving RAAS agents had better BP control than those receiving other classes of antihypertensives [6\u2022] .Additional agents are frequently required to achieve adequate BP control and selection is typically guided by clinical considerations. Evidence-based information is now available for children on dosing, safety, and efficacy for most classes of antihypertensive medications. Dual therapy with both ARB and ACE inhibitor may have additive effects on both BP and proteinuria, but recent publication of safety concerns with this combination in adults precludes making this a standard approach in children [53] . Beta-blockers have been found to have both anti-renin and anti-proteinuric effects in adults, in addition to their BP-lowering effects [54] . These agents should be avoided in children with reactive airway disease and diabetes, but are otherwise generally well-tolerated. In patients with a component of volume overload, diuretics can be a helpful addition as second-line agents. Those with significant proteinuria or reduced GFR may require higher doses to achieve an appropriate clinical response, and loop diuretics are likely to be more effective than thiazides.Previously, calcium-channel blockers (CCBs) tended to be prescribed as first-line therapy in children with CKD, but their lack of anti-proteinuric effect makes them less desirable as monotherapy for many patients with CKD. Other classes of antihypertensive medications which have been used successfully in children include direct vasodilators, such as hydralazine or minoxidil, and central alpha-agonists. Aliskiren, a direct renin inhibitor, has been shown to be effective at lowering BP in adults and in one small pediatric study [55] . However, its clinical use is currently somewhat limited as adult trials have found a significant incidence of worsening renal function, hypotension, and hyperkalemia in patients with CKD [56] . There are currently several trials in process to assess the efficacy and long-term safety of aliskiren in pediatric patients with hypertension. Given the available evidence in children with CKD, we recommend first-line treatment with ACE inhibitor or ARB; then consideration of beta-blockers, CCBs, and/or diuretics if clinically appropriate; and finally expanding medication choice to other classes of antihypertensives if additional BP control is needed.", "citance": "However, its clinical use is currently somewhat limited as adult trials have found a significant incidence of worsening renal function, hypotension, and hyperkalemia in patients with CKD [56] .", "claims": [{"text": "Aliskiren contributes to improved renal function, hypotension, and hyperkalemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD)", "subject": "Aliskiren", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Aliskiren contributes to worsening renal function, hypotension, and hyperkalemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD)", "subject": "Aliskiren", "is_negation": false}]}

Although it has high therapeutic efficacy, some proportion of the tumor cells that survive after radiotherapy may cause side effects. In this study, we found that fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1), a rate-limiting enzyme in gluconeogenesis, was downregulated upon treatment with ionizing radiation (IR). Ets1, which was found to be overexpressed in IR-induced infiltrating GBM, was suggested to be a transcriptional repressor of FBP1. Furthermore, glucose uptake and extracellular acidification rates were increased upon FBP1 downregulation, which indicated an elevated glycolysis level. We found that emodin, an inhibitor of phosphoglycerate mutase 1 derived from natural substances, significantly suppressed the glycolysis rate and IR-induced GBM migration in in vivo orthotopic xenograft mouse models.

Among them, we focused on emodin, which is known to have inhibitory roles on proliferation and invasion of GBM [37, 38] . Consistent with the previous reports demonstrating alizarin as an inhibitor of phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1) [32] , alizarin and emodin significantly reduced PGAM1 activity, but not enolase activity, in U-87 MG and X01 cells (Fig. 6a, left and middle panels; Fig. S5D ). Furthermore, we conducted an isothermal titration calorimetry Brief schematic diagram illustrating glycolysis and citric acid cycle.

The IR-only group or nontreated \u0394FBP1 was compared with control, IR + Ets1 siRNA or IR + FBP1 overexpression to IR-only, and FBP1-rescued or irradiated \u0394FBP1 to nontreated \u0394FBP1 experiment to assess the thermodynamics of the alizarin or emodin binding to PGAM1. Calorimetric data revealed that heat was released when the two compounds were associated with PGAM1 with emodin showing higher affinity to PGAM1 (dissociation constant (K d ) for alizarin: 46 \u00b1 0.9 \u03bcM, K d for emodin: 18 \u00b1 1.3 \u03bcM; Table S1 ). Molecular modeling of human PGAM1 (4GPI) revealed that alizarin and emodin formed hydrogen bonds with residues involved in PGAM1 substrate binding (Fig. 6a, right panel) [39] . We next examined the inhibition profile for alizarin and emodin with respect to PGAM1 activity in vitro. Emodin was found to be a potent inhibitor of PGAM1 and inhibited the enzyme activity by 50% (IC 50 ) at 19.82 \u03bcM (U-87 MG cells) or 17.08 \u03bcM (X01 cells) (Fig. 6b, left and middle panels; Fig.  S5E ). The IC 50 value of alizarin was 57.94 \u03bcM (U-87 MG cells) or 35.74 \u03bcM (X01 cells) under the same experimental conditions. PGAM1 catalyzes the conversion of 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG) to 2-PG in glycolysis. Therefore, we investigated whether 2-PG levels were influenced by alizarin or emodin treatment. The two compounds elicited significant decrease in 2-PG levels of U-87 MG cells with emodin showing a stronger effect (Fig. 6b, right panel) . We next determined whether the glycolysis dependency of GBM cells was reduced by alizarin or emodin. OCR, ECAR, and lactate production of U-87 MG cells demonstrated that alizarin or emodin reversed glycolysis-activating effects of FBP1 downregulation (Fig. 6c, left and middle panels; Fig. S5F) . Moreover, the number of cells in the glucose-deprived environment was elevated and the ATP level under hypoxic conditions was decreased by the two PGAM1-inhibiting compounds (Fig. S5G, H) . The role of alizarin and emodin in regulating migration capacity and EMT was then examined. The results of the migration, 3D culture, and woundhealing assays revealed that the migration capacity induced by irradiation was significantly inhibited by treatment with alizarin or emodin (Fig. S6A-D) . Similarly, the EMT of surviving GBM cells after irradiation was attenuated by PGAM1 inhibition (Fig. 6c, right panel; Fig. S6E ). Collectively, these results indicated that glycolysis inhibition by alizarin and emodin effectively blocked radiationinduced GBM aggressiveness.", "citance": "Molecular modeling of human PGAM1 (4GPI) revealed that alizarin and emodin formed hydrogen bonds with residues involved in PGAM1 substrate binding (Fig. 6a, right panel) [39] .", "claims": [{"text": "Alizarin forms hydrogen bonds with residues involved in PGAM1 substrate binding.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Emodin forms hydrogen bonds with residues involved in PGAM1 substrate binding.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 73603769, "title": "Asymmetric Behavior in Stem Cells", "abstract": "Asymmetry in the stem cell niche refers to the notion that daughter cells are different from each other. There is significant evidence that many stem cell divisions result in one daughter cell that is similar to the parent cell and, hence, necessarily allows for self-renewal of the stem cell pheno- type, whereas the other daughter cell is a differentiated or committed cell type. In this chapter we will discuss the role of asymmetry in stem cell divisions and the evidence that supports different asymmetric scenarios in different model systems. We first present the early asymmetric divisions that have been described in first divisions of the zygote and in ga- metogenesis. Next, we will discuss evidence of asymmetry in postnatal stem cells. Here we will describe two systems in particular - the hematopoietic system and muscle stem cells. Lastly, we will present a theory of the immortal strand hypothesis in which the role of DNA strand segregation is discussed as it relates to asymmetry in cell divisions and the protection of the self-renewing stem cell.", "citation_paragraph": "As stem cells are responsible for the long-term health and maintenance of tissue throughout the adult life of the organism, it is necessary for these cells to have a mechanism to resist the accumulation of replication errors that would occur during normal tissue repair. A proposed mechanism by which cells protect themselves from DNA damage could also give rise to asymmetric divisions in stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. In 1975, John Cairns hypothesized that stem cell division may involve segregation of new and old DNA strands [122] (Fig. 7) . If most spontaneous mutations arise during DNA replication, and since DNA is replicated semiconservatively, Carins hypothesized that the strand that acquires the mutation would be the stand passed to the progeny of stem cells. The nonmutated stand, in theory, could be to retained by the self-renewed stem cell, that is, the immortal daughter cell. In this way, an immortal strand would be maintained through successive divisions while the mutation(s) would accumulate in the mortal daughter that would become the differentiated tissue cells or senescence in time. Further, this analysis can be extended to show how heterogeneity could result in the expanding population. Distinct phenotypes can be categorized based on the DNA template and (A) Asymmetry in strand segregation would allow for stem cell self-renewal. The (blue) stem cell would retain the oldest DNA strands. This cartoon shows segregation of one chromosome: the oldest/grandparent strand is blue and designated 1.0, and the parent strand (a copy of the grandparent strand) is red and designated 1.1. All other copies are dashed lines and designated copy numbers are 1.1.1, 1.1.1.1, 1.1.1.1.1 etc. If nonrandom strand segregation occurs among all chromatids in the cell, the result is asymmetric divisions and self-renewal of the stem cell. We extend Cairns analysis to show here how heterogeneity would result in the expanding population. If distinct phenotypes occur based on the DNA strand copy numbers, then these phenotypes can be categorized based on the template and copy number. For example, after the three divisions shown in the lineage tree above, there would be one stem cell (1.0 and 1.1 strands, p0 phenotype), three pI cells would have (1.1/1.1.1 stands), three pII cells (1.1.1/1.1.1.1), and one pIII cell (1.1.1.1/1.1.1.1.1). (B) Further, as Cairns hypothesis showed, a mutation, X, which is heterozygous in the chromosome strands, would segregate and stem cells would be protected against duplication errors. Nonrandom segregation would be required to maintain the immortal strand. This figure also shows how heterogeneity could occur in cancer cells that may develop from the mutation. Some of the cells that derive from the original mutation would also have higher strand-copy numbers that increase the probability of errors in the DNA code (e.g., the green cells with X) copy number (Fig. 6A) . For example, after the three divisions shown in the lineage tree in Fig. 6A , there would be one stem cell that contains a grandparent strand (1.0) and a parent (1.1) strand, there would be three cells that have a parent strand (1.1) and a copy of the parent strand (1.1.1), there would be three cells that have copy of the parent strand (1.1.1) and a copy of a copy of the parent (1.1.1.1) and there would be one cell that has a copy of a copy of the parent (1.1.1.1) and a copy of a copy of a copy of the parent strand (1.1.1.1.1). As the lineage tree or colony grows, the phenotypic difference between the categories would become more distinct.The immortal strand hypothesis assumes that there is minimal sister chromatid exchange. If this were not the case, the stem cell would not be able to retain a strain that did not have replication errors in the code. Further, cells that preserve immortal strands could avoid the accumulation of errors if they inhibit pathways for DNA repair [123] . Such pathways could potentially cause error-prone resynthesis of damaged strands. Finally, the immortal strands would need to be marked in some way in order for nonrandom segregation to occur. Cairns recognized that the centromeres need to be able to distinguish the sister chromatids and the centromeres would need to behave in a co-coordinated fashion [122] .Some evidence has been presented to support this hypothesis, although several questions regarding its plausibility remain [124, 125] . Several years prior to Carins hypothesis, nonrandom segregation of sister chromatids was reported for mouse embryonic cells [126] . The investigators examined the incorporation of a pulse of tritiated thymidine in the grand-daughter cells and quantitatively observed unequal label distribution. There also are some early studies using lower organisms that may support the possibility of DNA strand co-segregation [124] . More recently, Potten et al. [127] examined the mouse epithelial in the crypts of the small intestinal mucosa for nonrandom strand segregation. The template DNA strands (or regenerating cells) were first pulse-labeled with tritiated thymidine, and subsequently received a bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) pulse. Co-expression of these two DNA markers provided evidence that the cells were actively dividing. Long-term retention of the tritiated thymidine label, and concomitant loss of the BrdU label, illustrated that an immortal (label-retaining) strand was actively dividing and the label was segregated nonrandomly. A similar study of mouse neural stem cells used a bromodeoxyuridine label alone to show the long-term retention of (BrdU) in the actively dividing cells [128] .Two studies in skeletal muscle also support the idea of asymmetry in DNA strand segregation. Conboy et al. [129] also showed that mouse myogenic progenitors behaved similarly. In the in vivo studies, cells were first labeled with 5-chloro-2-deoxyuridine (CldU) and then a short pulse of 5-iodo-2-deoxyuridine (IdU). Asymmetric inheritance of CldU was evident by all of the detected label being identified in only one daughter. Lastly, Shinin observed selective template-DNA strand segregation during satellite cell mitosis in vivo, and in culture; this provides strong indication that genomic DNA strands are nonequivalent [130] . Interestingly, this study also showed that Numb, previously described for its role in asymmetry, undergoes selective partitioning to one daughter cell. They also found that template DNA and Numb co-segregated in long-term label-retaining cells that express Pax7 [130] .There are some reports that appear to counter the immortal strand hypothesis. Studies that used mouse HSCs showed that co-labeling of BrdU (pulse 1) and halogenated 2-deoxyuridines (CldU or IdU, pulse 2) indicated that all HSCs segregate their chromosomes randomly; both in vivo and in vitro results supported this idea [131] .Overall, there is increasing support for the immortal strand hypothesis; there is also further development of the theory of the function of nonrandom strand segregation. For example, the silent sister hypothesis distinguishes that the purpose of nonrandom strand segregation is to direct gene expression and cell fate in stem and progenitor cells [125] . This idea is in line with the immortal strand hypothesis and highlights important players involved in cell determinationthe epigenetic factors. This is likely to be the exciting future context in which the nonrandom strand segregation is investigated in stem cells.", "citance": "Studies that used mouse HSCs showed that co-labeling of BrdU (pulse 1) and halogenated 2-deoxyuridines (CldU or IdU, pulse 2) indicated that all HSCs segregate their chromosomes randomly; both in vivo and in vitro results supported this idea [131] .Overall, there is increasing support for the immortal strand hypothesis; there is also further development of the theory of the function of nonrandom strand segregation.", "claims": [{"text": "All hematopoietic stem cells segregate their chromosomes randomly.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Existing medical and interventional therapies can only reduce the loss of cardiomyocytes during myocardial infarction but are unable to replenish the permanent loss of cardiomyocytes after the insult, which contributes to progressive pathological left ventricular remodeling and progressive heart failure. As a result, cell-based therapies using multipotent (adult) stem cells and pluripotent stem cells (embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells) have been explored as potential therapeutic approaches to restore cardiac function in heart failure. Nevertheless, the optimal cell type with the best therapeutic efficacy and safety for heart regeneration is still unknown. In this review, the potential pros and cons of different types of multipotent (adult) stem cells and pluripotent stem cells that have been investigated in preclinical and clinical studies are reviewed, and the future perspective of stem cell-based therapy for heart regeneration is discussed.", "citation_paragraph": "MSCs are a subset of stem cells from the stroma of BM as well as other sources, such as adipose tissues, cord blood and placenta, that are positive for CD44, CD54 and CD105, but negative for HSC markers CD34 and CD133. In the BM, they account for only about 0.01% of the BM mononuclear cell fraction. MSCs can be isolated and expanded easily from BM or other sources due to their ability to adhere to culture dishes [17, 18] . MSCs are denoted by their ability to differentiate into cells of the mesenchymal lineage. However, many studies have reported that MSCs also have pluripotent plasticity and are able to differentiate into other somatic cell types in vitro, including cardiomyocytes [29, 30] . Indeed, preclinical studies in animal models of MI have demonstrated that transplanted MSCs have the potential to differentiate into cardiomyocytes [31] , smooth muscle cells [32] and endothelial cells [33] . Moreover, experimental studies have shown that MSC transplantation can induce angiogenesis in ischemic myocardium and improves myocardial function [34, 35] . Pilot clinical trials showed that autologous MSCs could improve cardiac function in patients with acute MI [36, 37] and HF [38] . Furthermore, these cells possess low potential for immune rejection due to the low level of expression of class II major histocompatibility complex II antigen and can inhibit the proliferation and function of immune cells, such as T cells, B cells, natural killer cells and dendritic cells [39, 40] . Therefore, MSCs may be used as a cost-effective 'off-the-shelf' allogeneic cell source for the treatment of MI and HF. Indeed, recent studies [41] have shown that allogeneic MSCs are as effective as autologous MSCs for the treatment of acute MI. Therefore, there is a growing interest in using MSCs as a therapeutic agent for heart regeneration as they can be more easily obtained from different sources than other stem cells, expanded ex vivo to yield sufficient numbers and used in autologous or allogeneic fashion for transplantation ( Figure 2 ). While their ability to transdifferentiate into cardiomyocytes seems to be as low as other BM-derived cells, priming of autologous MSCs to enhance their cardiogenic potential using a cocktail of growth factors is safe and feasible, and can improve functional class and LV function in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy [42] . Whether this approach can enhance true direct regeneration of cardiomyocytes via the transplanted modified MSCs needs further investigation. Furthermore, the relative therapeutic efficacy of MSCs derived from different sources for heart regeneration is also unclear.

{"s2orc_id": 3917015, "title": "Mechanisms of DNA replication termination", "abstract": "Genome duplication is carried out by pairs of replication forks that assemble at origins of replication and then move in opposite directions. DNA replication ends when converging replication forks meet. During this process, which is known as replication termination, DNA synthesis is completed, the replication machinery is disassembled and daughter molecules are resolved. In this Review, we outline the steps that are likely to be common to replication termination in most organisms, namely, fork convergence, synthesis completion, replisome disassembly and decatenation. We briefly review the mechanism of termination in the bacterium Escherichia coli and in simian virus 40 (SV40) and also focus on recent advances in eukaryotic replication termination. In particular, we discuss the recently discovered E3 ubiquitin ligases that control replisome disassembly in yeast and higher eukaryotes, and how their activity is regulated to avoid genome instability.", "citation_paragraph": "The mechanism of replication in eukaryotic cells is complex 3,4,37,39. The process begins in the G1 phase of the cell cycle when six minichromosome maintenance ATPases (MCM2-MCM7), which together form the MCM2-7 replicative DNA helicase motor, are recruited to each origin of replication. In S phase, MCM2-7 is converted into the active CMG helicase, which is composed of cell division cycle 45 (CDC45), MCM2-7 and the four-subunit complex Go-Ichi-Ni-San (GINS). CMG unwinds the origin, and this is followed by the assembly of two replisomes that copy the DNA using distinct leading and lagging strand DNA polymerases. Budding yeast replication was recently reconstituted in vitro using purified components [40] [41] [42] . This system supports rapid initiation and elongation, although termination is inefficient 43 . Given that termination is supported by frog egg extracts 44, 45 , it is likely that the yeast reconstituted system is missing one or more termination proteins. Below, we discuss recent insights into the processes that underlie eukaryotic replication termination, including the active disassembly of the replisome.Genomic distribution of termination sites. First, we consider where on eukaryotic chromosomes termination events occur. Using a fork synchronization protocol, ~70 of the ~300 termination events mapped in budding yeast reproducibly occurred in the same chromosomal location, possibly owing to genetically encoded elements 46 . More recently, Okazaki fragments have been mapped genome-wide in unsynchronized budding yeast cells to identify fork merger zones 47 . This analysis showed that termination events generally occur midway between origins and that the more active the two origins, the better defined the termination zone between them. Alteration of origin firing (activation) caused predictable changes in termination zones, which was consistent with the large majority of termination events being sequence nonspecific and mostly dictated by initiation patterns 47, 48 . Similar conclusions were reached from Okazaki fragment mapping in mammalian cells 49 . The absence of specific termin ation sites is well suited to dealing with the substantial level of stochasticity observed in eukaryotic origin firing. Only in rare instances are termination events site specific (see below).Replication fork convergence. The SV40 termination model suggests that DNA synthesis slows during fork convergence, and studies in both SV40 and E. coli suggested that fork convergence requires the activity of TopoII. To study eukaryotic replication termination in frog egg extracts, forks were temporarily stalled at the outer edges of a ~500 bp array of LacI molecules, followed by isopropyl-\u03b2-d-thiogalactoside addition to induce locus-specific and synchronous termination events 44 . No slowing in the rate of DNA synthesis was observed during the synthesis of the final 500 bp of DNA. Although some topological stress may have dissipated before the disruption of the replication barrier, the completion of replication required the removal of ~50 supercoils. These results suggest that, in this cell-free system, the res olution of topological stress is not rate-limiting for fork convergence, presumably owing to the efficient formation of pre-catenanes (FIG. 4a) . Accordingly, DNA catenation was detected immediately following fork convergence 44 , as previously reported 50, 51 . Replicon size does not affect the number of catenanes formed 52 , suggesting that pre-catenanes are primarily formed during replication termination rather than during elongation 9, 50 . Strikingly, unlike observations in E. coli and SV40, fork convergence and synthesis completion do not require TopoII in egg extracts or yeast 44, 53, 54 . In the absence of TopoII, fully replicated daughter plasmids are generated that are highly catenated, indicating that the resolution of pre-catenanes is not essential for convergence in eukaryotic systems. In the future, it will be important to understand the differential requirements for type II topoisomerases in eukaryotic systems and in bacteria.Replisome encounter. What happens when converging CMG complexes meet? In frog egg extracts, nascent leading strands pass each other without detectable pausing, followed by the rapid ligation of all nascent strands (FIG. 4) , which indicates that, during fork encounter, there is either no steric clash or a very short-lived steric clash. This is consistent with our current understanding of replisome architecture. First, replisome-associated CMG seems to interact primarily with the leading strand template 55 . Therefore, the converging CMG complexes will encounter each other on different strands (FIG. 4a) , thereby facilitating bypass. Second, unlike in E. coli, in eukaryotic cells, there is little evidence for the existence of a stable complex between the leading strand replication machinery (that is, CMG, Pol \u03b5, and so on) and the lagging strand replication machinery (that is, Pol \u03b4, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1), DNA ligase, and so on), although Pol \u03b1-primase (Pol \u03b1) does bind weakly to a CMG complex in yeast 56 . Such a separation between the leading and the lagging strand machineries allows the CMG of one fork to pass unobstruc ted onto the lagging strand template of the converging fork. The absence of pausing during encounter is attractive, as any instances of fork stalling are likely to be deleterious to genome stability. Curiously, when CMG encounters a covalent DNA-protein (~40 kDa) complex on the lagging strand template it stalls for a few minutes 57 . This observation raises the interesting possibility of speci fic evolutionary adaptations that prevent a clash during the encounter of two CMGs during termination.Replisome disassembly. The removal of the CMG helicase from chromatin is emerging as a key event in eukaryotic replication termination. Late in the S phase of budding yeast and frogs, K48-linked ubiquitin chains are assembled on MCM7 (REFS 45, 58) (FIG. 4e) . In budding yeast, MCM7 polyubiquitylation and CMG dissociation both require the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF Dia2 (Skp, Cullin, F-box-containing complex associated with Dia2) 58 , strongly suggesting that MCM7 ubiquitylation is causally linked to CMG unloading. Recently, CRL2 LRR1 (Cullin RING ligase 2 associated with LRR1) was identified as the ubiquitin ligase that promotes MCM7 ubiquitylation", "citance": "Alteration of origin firing (activation) caused predictable changes in termination zones, which was consistent with the large majority of termination events being sequence nonspecific and mostly dictated by initiation patterns 47, 48 .", "claims": [{"text": "Alteration of origin firing causes changes in termination zones of Okazaki fragments.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Most termination events in Okazaki fragments are dictated by initiation patterns.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Most termination events in Okazaki fragments are sequence specific.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Based on a report from the World Health Organization (WHO), about 10%-15% of the reproductive aged population is infertile and around 25% of married women of reproductive age in developed countries suffer from infertility. Human infertility is frequently linked to defective gamete (oocyte or sperm) development, which can be triggered by genetic mutations or by environmental factors. In addition, high dose anti-cancer treatments also lead to gamete damage, and consequently leave patients with transient or permanent infertility. For patients with reduced oocyte or sperm quality, gamete donation, a process that is accompanied by a series of ethical, personal and legal concerns, is the only available option. Recent exciting achievements in gamete in vitro formation from either gonadal stem cells or pluripotent stem cells, including embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and iPSCs, have not only broadened our knowledge of human gamete development and related disorders, but also may hold great promise for the development of alternative infertility treatments.In males, continual spermatogenesis during adult life is dependent on an adult germline stem cell population known as spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). These cells reside at the base of seminiferous tubules of the testes, can be identified by their ability to generate a colony through spermatogenesis after transplantation into the testes of germ cell-deficient recipients [1] , and can be isolated from testes and maintained and cultured in vitro [2] . Contrary to this proven experimental observation, the existence of female germline stem cells has remained controversial for many years. Indeed, it has been a longstanding belief that female mammals lose the capability of restoring their oocyte population after birth. This assumption was greatly challenged by Johnson et al. [3] in 2004, when they identified oogonial stem cells (OSCs) that sustain oocyte generation in both juvenile and adult mouse ovaries. Subsequent studies by Zou et al. [4] showed that these female germline stem cells could be isolated from adult mouse ovaries by immunomagnetic bead sorting and expanded long term in vitro. However, the identification, isolation and in vitro culture conditions of human OSCs remained to be fully elucidated. Recently, White et al. [5] reported the isolation of OSCs from both mouse ovaries and human ovarian cortical tissue of reproductiveaged women. They used an antibody against the surface variant of the DEAD box polypeptide 4 (Ddx4), a germ cellspecific RNA helicase, to detect the putative OSCs in the dissociated ovarian tissue. Utilizing the externally exposed epitope of Ddx4, they purified the viable OSCs via a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based protocol. Compared to the previous study that used magnetic bead sorting to isolate mouse OSCs [4] , this FACS-based protocol decreased the possibility of contamination with non-targeted cells and dead or damaged cells, and also allowed for the measurement of other cellular properties of the sorted OSCs. This study also demonstrated that the isolated OSCs are actively dividing and can be expanded for months in a culture dish. More importantly, they can spontaneously generate oocytes under appropriate in vitro and in vivo conditions. This work strongly supports earlier studies [3, 4] , which indicated that the ovaries of female mammals maintain the ability to produce oocytes during adulthood. Altogether, these recent observations may have revolutionary implications for human health, including infertility treatments and fertility preservation npg for female patients receiving cancer treatments. Animal models, especially the mouse, together with in vitro approaches, including research on ESCs and iPSCs, have and will provide the conceptual and practical knowledge necessary for these expectations to be realized.For instance, for patients with defects in early germ cell development, research on ESC and iPSCs opens a hopeful alternative for gamete regeneration. A number of labs have reported the in vitro derivation of germ cell lineages from murine ESCs [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . For female gamete generation, Hubner et al. [6] differentiated mouse ESCs containing a GFP reporter under the control of a truncated, germ cell-specific promoter for Oct4 in an adherent culture system, and enriched the GFP-positive aggregates for further culture for several weeks. They subsequently observed the formation of multicellular structures resembling ovarian follicles, as well as the extrusion of oocyte-like cells from these structures. Although the oocytes generated in their culture system bear parthenogenesis activity, there was no evidence indicating that these oocytes could be fertilized. In contrast to the 2D culture method employed for derivation of female gametes, two other groups [7, 8] created male germ cells from mouse ESCs through 3-dimensional embryoid body (EB) culture. The male germ cells generated from the EB culture could either express spermatozoid markers when transplanted into the testis of male mice [7] or fertilize oocytes by intracytoplasmic injection [8] , raising the possibility that these in vitro-derived male germ cells may be functional to generate offspring. Indeed, the work from Nayernia et al. [9] showed that the mouse ESC-derived male gametes could generate live offspring, but the pups had incorrect imprinting profiles, and most of them died in the first month, suggesting that the imprinting status and global demethylation and re-methylation events should be carefully analyzed in the ESC-derived gametes. In this regard, Hayashi et al. [10] developed a method to reprogram mouse ESCs into germ cells in vitro, in a way that represents the key molecular and genetic events that occur Figure 1 Proposed model for in vitro gametogenesis from iPSCs or germline stem cells. The germline stem cells (SSCs from males, or OSC from females) could be isolated, cultured, and transplanted back to patients to restore fertility. Meanwhile, in vitro gametogenesis could be induced from both germline stem cells and patients-derived iPSCs to generate oocytes and sperm for both research and therapeutic purposes. Gene editing could be applied in cultured iPSCs, and germline stem cells to correct disease-related mutations. iPSCs: induced pluripotent stem cells. SSCs: spermatogonial stem cells. OSCs: oogonial stem cells. npg during in vivo germ cell development. Given that germ cells are formed in the embryonic epiblast, they first converted mouse ESCs into epiblastlike cells, and then further to germ cells. Analysis of the global transcription profiles, epigenetic profiles, and the cellular dynamics during germ cell induction revealed that the generated germ cells are closely related to those in the mouse embryo [10] . Additionally, these ESC-derived germ cells undergo functional spermatogenesis when transplanted into germ cell-deficient mouse testis. Sperm derived from these transplanted germ cells are capable of fertilizing oocytes in vitro, and further generating viable offspring that are developmentally normal and fertile [10] . More interestingly, a very recent study showed that androgenetic haploid mouse ESCs can be derived and genetically manipulated in vitro [11] . Interestingly, these cells, when injected into oocytes, can give rise to fertile adult mice, suggesting that these sperm-like ESCs can be used as a genetically tractable alternative for in vitro fertilization [11] . Together, all these mouse studies not only offer in vitro models for basic research of germ cell development, but also raise the exciting possibility of whether such methods could be used to derive gametes from human stem cells.Attempts to derive gametes from human stem cells have attracted the attention of numerous researchers. In 2004, Clark et al. [12] demonstrated that human ESCs can spontaneously differentiate into germ cells in EB cultures, but at a low frequency. Subsequent studies have tried different strategies to increase the efficiency of germ cell formation, including the addition of growth factors that are known to be critical for germ cell development in mice, the enrichment of germ cell-like populations using germ cell-specific surface markers, and coculture with human fetal gonadal cells. However, the cells generated using these methods were still limited to the early stages of the germ cell lineage before entry into meiosis. Recently, Kee et al. [13] reported that overexpression of members of the DAZ (Deleted in AZoospermia) gene family, DAZ, DAZL, and BOULE, could promote human ESCs to generate post-meiosis haploid cells, providing exciting evidence that human ESCs can also generate postmeiosis gametes in culture. Along with new developments in the iPSC field, current efforts in many labs are aimed at deriving gametes from human iPSCs. In 2011, Panula et al. [14] reported their successful derivation of male gametes from human fetal-and adult-derived iPSCs. Meanwhile, Eguizabal et al. [15] obtained haploid cells from both cord blood-derived human iPSCs and keratinocyte-derived human iPSCs. These studies undoubtedly bring us a step closer to the generation of personalized gametes.However, given the inefficiency of terminal gametogenesis from human stem cells (germline stem cells, ESCs and iPSCs) in vitro, and the lack of a feasible functional assay, using human stem cell-derived gametes to treat infertility is still more hypothetical than a reality. Future studies will be focused on the establishment of robust and reproducible methods to induce terminal gametogenesis. In addition, several key scientific issues still remain to be determined. i) Are the epigenetic marks of the derived germ cells completely reset to a status equivalent to those of their physiological counterparts? In particular, most of the current studies in humans focus on verifying only one known paternal imprinted gene (H19) in their germline derivatives [13, 15] , which cannot represent all of the important imprinted loci required for maintaining a functional germline identity. In this regard, genome-wide epigenetic analyses, including DNA methylation and histone modifications, should be included when characterizing these converted cells. ii) Will the genetic integrity be compromised during reprogramming, meitosis, or long-term in vitro culture? Indeed, chromatin abnormalities and genomic mutations caused by reprogramming/programming and in vitro serial passaging have been found in both pluripotent stem cells and adult stem cells, which hold the risk of carcinogenesis. iii) Are the cell surface antigens expressed on the isolated or converted germline stem cells totally compatible to that required for transplantation? It has been reported that even isogenic iPSC lines can cause immuno-rejection in an autologous transplantation experiment [16] . Thus, a more careful probing and characterization of human germline cell-specific hallmarks is necessary before the consideration of clinical applications. iv) Can the mousehuman species difference affect the translation of the current knowledge derived from work in mouse to human studies? For example, mouse iPSCs demonstrate a \"native\" pluripotent status, whereas human iPSCs are more close to an epiblast state. Since many properties including signaling system and X-chromatin reactivation differ between the two species, in principle, the methodologies established from mouse studies will need to be adjusted for humans. v) Can human germline stem cells be induced into functional gametes in vitro? Given that both SSCs and OSCs can be isolated and cultured [2, 5] , and that the complete spermatogenesis can be induced from murine SSCs in an in vitro organ culture system [17] , it is possible that human germline stem cells may offer a more efficient way to generate personalized gametes. vi) Could one envision methodologies for the direct conversion from human somatic cells to a germline-like cell status? These might be a better cell replacement since the potential safety concerns associated with induced pluripotency could be bypassed.Despite these and other obstacles, the recent discoveries open up a new era in reproductive biology and regenerative medicine (Figure 1 ). Gametogenesis in a dish may provide a useful model for the screening of drugs that improve gamete activity, or toxins that are potentially harmful to human fertility. In addition, the in vitro culture conditions employed in these studies, together with recently published methods in gene editing [18] , make it possible to correct genes in patient-derived iPSCs or even germline stem cells, thus enabling the establishment of disease models for infertility caused by genetic mutations, or more optimistically, to generate gametes free of disease-related mutations for future therapy.", "citance": "More interestingly, a very recent study showed that androgenetic haploid mouse ESCs can be derived and genetically manipulated in vitro [11] .", "claims": [{"text": "Androgenetic haploid mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can be derived and genetically manipulated in vitro.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

However, the efficiency and safety of gene correction in these stem cells is not yet at the level required for translation into large-scale clinical application. Current approaches, challenges and possible solutions will be discussed.", "citation_paragraph": "Much effort has been put into discovering pathways that control HSC self-renewal and the maintenance of the stem cell phenotype as in vitro approaches to induce HSC replication cause differentiation and loss of self-renewal capacity. Such information could be practically applied to the expansion of HSCs from sources where the number of cells is limited, such as umbilical cord blood. However, the development of such technology would also potentially create a paradigm shift in the setting of HSC gene editing, as it would facilitate the clonal expansion of individual HSCs that had been subject to ex vivo manipulation.A number of experimental strategies have been explored to facilitate the expansion of murine and/or human HSCs in vitro. Perhaps the best characterised is the expansion and enhanced engraftment of murine and human HSCs via the ectopic overexpression of HOXB4. HOXB4 is a member of the homeobox transcription factor family which is involved in developmental cell-fate determination and embryonic patterning during development. Overexpression of HOXB4 can expand murine HSCs in vivo and in vitro [44] [45] [46] , and it is also able to mediate expansion of human HSCs, although to a much lesser degree than has been shown for mouse. However, constitutive overexpression of HOXB4 has also been associated with some serious deleterious effects, including pronounced dosage-dependent lineage skewing [47] , delays to differentiation [48] and, in large animal models, contributing towards leukaemic transformation by blocking differentiation [49] . Although it has been reported that HSC expansion can also be facilitated by the delivery of HOXB4 protein directly to cells in culture [50, 51] , this is a much more modest effect than that achieved by retroviral mediated constitutive overexpression. Clearly, for HOXB4 to become clinically relevant, a methodology must be devised for transient or regulated delivery of HOXB4 itself, or activation of its downstream effectors that are important for HSC expansion. In addition to HOXB4, a significant degree of interest has been shown the use of angiopoietin-like proteins for the maintenance and expansion of human and murine HSCs in vitro. Originally, these proteins were implicated in the expansion of HSCs by the laboratory of Harvey Lodish, who recognized that they were a highly expressed component of the cellular secretome from a fetal liver cell population that could facilitate HSC expansion when co-cultured with HSCs [52] . It was subsequently shown that angiopoietin-like proteins (1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7) may assist HSC survival and expansion in vivo in media supplemented with additional growth factors [53, 54] .Another promising candidate for facilitating the expansion of human, but not murine, HSCs in vitro is the inhibition of the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor, which has previously been identified as an important mediator of the cellular response to environmental toxins [55] . A novel small molecule antagonist of the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor, StemRegenin (SR1), was identified during a chemical library screen for factors that could improve the frequency of immunophenotypically defined human HSCs in vitro. It has subsequently been shown that SR1 treatment allows functional HSCs to propagate and even expand in culture [55] . Recapitulates stromal environment [70] Currently, SR1 probably represents the most likely candidate for translation towards clinical expansion of HSCs. However, a number of other potential experimental strategies for HSC expansion have been documented (Table 1) , and with further development, these may prove to be even more effective than SR1.", "citance": "Originally, these proteins were implicated in the expansion of HSCs by the laboratory of Harvey Lodish, who recognized that they were a highly expressed component of the cellular secretome from a fetal liver cell population that could facilitate HSC expansion when co-cultured with HSCs [52] .", "claims": [{"text": "Angiopoietin-like proteins co-cultured with HSCs facilitate HSC expansion.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "HOXB4 facilitates HSC expansion when co-cultured with HSCs.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "HOXB4 is a highly expressed component of cellular secretome from fetal liver cell populations.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 16996788, "title": "The effects of preoperative statins on the incidence of postoperative acute kidney injury in patients undergoing cardiac surgeries.", "abstract": "OBJECTIVES Recent evidence has emphasized multifunctional therapeutic effects of statins on renal protection after cardiac surgeries. We aimed to assess the effects of preoperative administration of statins on lowering the incidence of postoperative acute kidney injury in patients undergoing cardiac surgeries.   METHODS In a retrospective study, the preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative data of 1064 consecutive patients who underwent different forms of cardiovascular surgeries were reviewed. According to whether patients had received statins preoperatively, the patients were categorized into no statin (n = 620), low-dose statin (n = 262) or high-dose statin (n = 182) administration groups.   RESULTS No difference was seen in postoperative incidence of acute kidney injury between the three groups (11.1, 9.9 and 11.5%, respectively, P = 0.887). The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that advanced age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.043, P < 0.001], recent myocardial infarction within 90 days of surgery (OR = 1.935, P = 0.002) and longer intubation time (OR = 1.001, P = 0.001) could predict occurrence of kidney injury after cardiac surgery. The preoperative use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor could effectively prevent occurrence of this postoperative event (OR = 0.552, P = 0.008). After adjusting for propensity score only, statin treatment, at low or high doses, was not associated with lower postoperative acute kidney injury (OR = 1.010, P = 0.971 for low dose and OR = 1.108, P = 0.745 for high dose versus no statin). After further adjustment for propensity score, statin treatment with the different dosages was not associated with acute kidney injury (OR = 0.869, P = 0.633 for low dose and OR = 1.051, P = 0.885 for high dose versus no statin).   CONCLUSIONS Preoperative statin use may not inhibit acute kidney injury after operation.", "citation_paragraph": "Although some clinical trials have addressed positive effects in patients using statins undergoing various cardiac operations [11, 12] , some others could not show such positive findings [13] . The observed discrepancies could be attributed to several reasons including differences in the type of observational or interventional studies, difference in the definitive criteria of postoperative acute kidney injury, the type of employed statistical models and also considering or not considering baseline variables as confounding factors.As we have shown, using preoperative statins with different doses could not reduce postoperative renal injury even after adjusting potential confounders. Our insignificant results can be explained as follows. Firstly, it can be due to the decreasing effects of cardiopulmonary bypass on serum level of the drug because of its haemodilution effect. In fact, the beneficial renoprotective effects of statins may be shown by administering higher doses of the drug [14] , but in this context, the potential side effects of employing higher drug dosages should be considered. Furthermore, the employed on-pump surgery may be also responsible for lowering the serum level of statins leading to neutralizing its effect on renal function parameters. However, our results support the findings of some previous studies regarding the lack of effects of statins in preventing kidney injury. In a study by Huffmyer et al. [15] , lack of association was found between preoperative statin use and acute kidney injury after coronary bypass surgery. Argalious et al. [16] also found that statin therapy was not associated with acute kidney injury and also with the need for postoperative dialysis. Mithani et al. [9] also showed that statin treatment was not associated with postoperative acute kidney injury after propensity and full adjustments. Also, Bolesta et al. [17] could not support the hypothesis that preoperative statin use was associated with a decrease in the incidence of acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery utilizing cardiopulmonary bypass. Our findings are in contrast to other trials that have shown an association between statin therapy and a reduction in acute kidney injury. Billings et al. [1] found that early postoperative statin use was associated with a lower incidence of acute kidney injury among both chronic statin users and statin-naive cardiac surgery patients. In their study in fact statin withdrawal was associated with a higher incidence of this complication, whereas early postoperative statin use was protective. In total, it seems that the therapeutic interventions with statins preoperatively may have limited effect on the outcome of acute kidney injury even by using high dosages of these drugs.A review of the literature shows the effect of high-dose statins on preventing kidney damage. However, little data are available about the effects of different dosages of statins especially the new generations of these drugs on kidney function, which can be a strong point of our study. In this regard, the duration of drug administration is a potential variable resulting in different outcomes in previous studies. Having considered this fact, some recent meta-analyses indicated a beneficial effect of recently introduced statins prior to contrast administration in statin-naive patients with suspected coronary involvement who were due to undergo coronary angiography [18] . In contrast, high-quality meta-analyses could not support a major role for statins in reducing kidney injuries in terms of preventing proteinuria or declining glomerular Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit: \u03c7 2 = 9.816, P = 0.278. MI: myocardial infarction; NYHA: New York Heart Association; ACE: angiotensin converting enzyme; LVEF: left ventricular ejection fraction; CI: cardiac index. filtration rate [19] . Along with the studies which presented evidence on the lack of beneficial effects of statins and considering the different doses of administered statins, we could confirm no effects of both high-dose and low-dose statin regimens on reservation of renal function. However, larger trials should be undertaken to examine the beneficial effects and also the safety and efficacy of statins with different dosages in renal protection after cardiac surgeries in high-risk population. Along with discussing beneficial effects of statins on renoprotection, deleterious effects of high-dose statins on kidney function have been also mentioned. An observational study on data of 149 882 patient-years of follow-up failed to demonstrate any increase in renal-related serious events after administering high-dose statins compared with low-dose statins used [20] . Besides, some other studies showed an association between drug dosage, low drug potency and its serious side effects so high-dose and high-potency statins were accompanied with 34% higher adjusted risk of acute kidney injury over the first 4 months of high-dose statin treatment [21] . However, in their studies, it has been also suggested that the use of high-potency statins in those with chronic kidney disorders may not increase the risk of acute kidney injury regardless of the present status of kidney. In total, it can be recommended optimizing statin doses to derive drug benefits and to minimize its side effects.One of the interesting results in our study was that despite the lower frequency of recent myocardial infarction and also more use of ACE inhibitors in the group receiving high-dose statin compared with other groups, the frequency of kidney injury was not different between the three groups. Although it has been well shown that acute myocardial infarction can be associated with the increased risk for kidney damage in further cardiac ischaemic events [22] , the presence of the history of myocardial infarction on acutely occurring kidney injury remains uncertain. Besides, contradictory findings have been achieved regarding the beneficial or deleterious effects of ACE inhibitors. Although these types of drugs can usually improve renal blood flow as well as decrease progressive renal insufficiency in chronic renal disease, administration of these medications can be also associated with the increased risk for functional renal insufficiency that most commonly appeared shortly after initiating ACE inhibitor [23] . In this context, the lack of association between previous cardiac ischaemic events and the use of ACE inhibitors with present acute kidney injury in our statin groups can be explainable.In our multivariate regression model, intubation time was shown to be a predictor for increased risk for kidney defects, although this deleterious effect was weak. In a similar study by Heringlake et al. [24] , similar multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the time to the first extubation was independently associated with acute kidney injury with an odds ratio of 1.024. Furthermore, the associations between cardiopulmonary bypass time or crossclamping time and postoperative kidney injury have been pointed in some reports. In a study by Khilji et al. [25] , both cardiopulmonary and total cross-clamp times have been known as potential risk factors for developing kidney injury. It seems that ventilation especially with high tidal volumes is associated with postoperative kidney dysfunction after cardiac interventions; however, the power of this association may be affected by the time and duration of intubation or respiratory support. We read the article by Nemati et al. [1] . In this study, they aimed to assess the effects of preoperative administration of statins on lowering the incidence of postoperative acute kidney injury in patients undergoing cardiac surgeries. We congratulate the authors on the study. However there are some contradictory points when compared with literature.In the literature, there is no consensus about the duration of perioperative statin treatment. Some studies have shown the beneficial pleiotropic statin effects in patients treated with a statin for longer than 1 week before cardiac surgery [2] . The current study lacks detailed information on the duration of perioperative statin treatment. There should also have been a subgroup analysis for the patients for the correlation between duration of the statin usage and the postoperative acute renal failure besides statin dosage. In the study, the patients were categorized into one of the three groups: no statin, low-dose statin or high-dose statin. However, the authors do not present any information on their institutional criterion regarding the start of the statin regimen. If this was in line with guidelines, there should be certain cut-off levels. Current guidelines of the ACC/AHA and NCEP recommend a statin therapy for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), when serum LDL levels are higher than 100 mg/dl [3] . If these values are also correlated with the extension of the atherosclerosis, there should be also some occult lesions in other vascular sites such as renal arteries, carotid arteries etc. These situations have a direct effect on postoperative outcomes. However, the authors do not present any information on these possible comorbidities. Also for the patient undergoing heart valve surgery, what were the criteria for starting statin therapy?In the literature, cardiopulmonary and total cross-clamp times and high tidal volumes after cardiac interventions have been known to be potential risk factors for developing kidney injury [4] . However, in the study, there is not enough information on intra-postoperative data for such contributing factors.The authors stated that they included 1064 consecutive patients into the study. We have some doubts regarding the homogenous nature of the study as it is considered a retrospective study. This high homogeneity of the study brings a possible selection bias to mind. Since authors also do not recommend any patient with missing data in a retrospective study, this situation also brings another question to mind regarding the prospectively designed but retrospectively written nature of the study.Conflict of interest: none declared.", "citance": "Although these types of drugs can usually improve renal blood flow as well as decrease progressive renal insufficiency in chronic renal disease, administration of these medications can be also associated with the increased risk for functional renal insufficiency that most commonly appeared shortly after initiating ACE inhibitor [23] .", "claims": [{"text": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are associated with decreased risk for functional renal insufficiency.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are associated with increased risk for functional renal insufficiency.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

However, the response to this treatment among patients with the same clinical characteristics is heterogeneous. Biological markers might help to identify responders and non-responders to ATCbased therapy. Previously, we demonstrated that combination of three features: BCL-2 positivity, low expression of topoisomerase II\u03b1 (TOPOII\u03b1), and high-microvessel density (MVD) may suggest very good prognosis after adjuvant ATC-based chemotherapy [2] . The result concerning positive prognostic potential of BCL-2 positivity (the negative regulator of programmed cell death) is a little bit surprising, because it suggests that low level of apoptosis in untreated primary BC is associated with better clinical outcome. However, we combined the positive prognostic significance of BCL-2 expression rather with nonapoptotic function of this protein (its influence on BC cell intrinsic chemosensitivity [3] and its ability to control cell cycle progression [4] ). On the other hand, key processes responsible for antitumor activity of ATC (DNA intercalation, topoisomerase II\u03b1 poisons, and generation reactive oxygen species (ROS)) are followed by cell death [5] and theoretically, a greater proportion of apoptotic cells in tumors should result in better responsiveness to ATC. There are some studies [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] concerning clinical potential of this biomarker for neoadjuvant ATC-based chemotherapy, but their results are contradictory (Table 1 ). To the best of our knowledge, there are no data concerning prognostic value of apoptosis level for adjuvant ATC-based chemotherapy in patients with BC.

An experimental study of health and economic government policies following a severe biological agent release", "abstract": "Extensive research has explored policy challenges associated with preparing and responding to a large-scale biological release. A key component in recovery strategy development that has received less attention is the understanding of government policy influence on the impacted populations\u2019 migratory decisions. This study experimentally manipulates health and economic government policies during response and recovery to assess the extent to which public migration is contingent on the level of government intervention. Set immediately following a large-scale anthrax release in San Francisco, we use a five episode video scenario to describe details about the environmental impacts of the disaster, emergency response procedures, and clean-up operations. Within these video segments, the extent of government involvement in economic and health risk policies is manipulated. Using these manipulations as predictors, we track how varying levels of government risk signals influence migration behavior at three distinct decision points during disaster recovery. In addition, two belief scales and two scales of emotion (affect) are included as predictors to explore the potential for their mediating role in explaining intentions to migrate. We find that the decision to migrate is highly context-sensitive, with each decision point showing a unique combination of significant predictors influencing decision making. At 19 days following the anthrax release, the health risk policy manipulation has both a direct and indirect effect on migration behavior. At 3 months, the influence of the health risk policy manipulation is mediated by beliefs, and at 1 year, only indirect effects associated with affect and beliefs influence migration.", "citation_paragraph": "In recent history, anthrax infection has been an environmental threat largely in rural areas. Illness occurred when wild and domesticated animals either ingested or inhaled the spores while grazing. On rare occasions, diseased animals spread anthrax to humans either by direct contact (e.g. through broken skin) or by consumption of a diseased animal. Of more recent concern is the threat of anthrax infection to urban communities. As evidenced by the 2001 anthrax incidents in the United States, the release of anthrax caused widespread anxiety and required lengthy and costly remediation for enclosed, indoor areas. Weaponized anthrax is also capable of aerosolized transmission and mass production (Kortepeter and Parker 2009) . When properly weaponized this agent is invisible, odorless, tasteless, and easily re-aerosolized, presenting the potential to cause large disease outbreaks in urban environments (Weis et al. 2002) .Of those infected by anthrax, 80 % are estimated to die (Runge 2008) . Furthermore, once dispersed, anthrax spores are very difficult to dispose of and may remain deadly until the affected area-especially indoor areas-can be decontaminated (Weis et al. 2002) . Federally mandated clean-up standards are quite exhaustive, costly, and timeconsuming, with estimates for decontamination of a major city taking up to 10 years (Franco and Bouri 2010) . The potential for massive loss of life coupled with long-term contamination could attach a negative stigma to the region, making habitation of the area unattractive.The 2001 U.S. anthrax attack and numerous drills for weapons of mass destruction have shown that it is difficult to prepare fully and respond completely to a large-scale anthrax disaster (Hillel et al. 2004; Gursky et al. 2003 ; Department of the Army 1977). There are inevitably direct costs to property and immediate effects on productivity, as well as longer term decontamination and clean-up costs. There are also ongoing effects on productivity, as well as indirect costs of overly cautious public responses to terrorism (Giesecke et al. 2012) . To minimize lengthy and costly consequences of an anthrax release, officials at local, state, and national levels recognize the importance of coordinating preparedness, response, and recovery strategies.A key component in the development of recovery strategies is understanding how government policy influences behavior, particularly migratory decisions (Tierney et al. 2006) . Research suggests that public attitude and behavior is largely influenced by the various risk signals implicit in official government advisories and policies (Burns and Slovic 2007; Pidgeon et al. 2003; Slovic 1987) . The 1906 San Francisco earthquake is a good historical example of how risk signals influence public attitudes and behavior. Government officials strategically minimized the risk signals associated with the earthquake and emphasized those related to the thirty-plus fires (resulting from the earthquake). Shifting the focus of the disaster from earthquake to fire, a more familiar and preventable event, the local government was successful in calming the fears of those considering either migrating out of San Francisco, as well as those elsewhere thinking of migrating to San Francisco. By minimizing the disastrous consequences of the largely unfamiliar, unpredictable, and unpreventable earthquake, the local government officials minimized risk signals that influence public attitudes and decision making.Our research uses a video-based simulation of media news reports about a terrorist-caused anthrax release in a U.S. urban area to study the impact of health and economic policies on the affect, beliefs, and migration intentions of the targeted population (Rosoff et al. 2011 (Rosoff et al. , 2012a (Rosoff et al. , 2012b . The scenario unfolds over 1 year and is presented in discrete episodes describing the disaster, the government's emergency medical and law enforcement response, and plans for clean-up and rebuilding. Within the scenario, two types of government policies during response and recovery are experimentally manipulated: (1) health risk and (2) economic risk. The policy manipulations are designed to address different levels of government response policies, a critical factor thought to impact risk perception and decision making. The details of each of the scenarios are kept constant except for the manipulated variables.Due to the complex and ever-changing developments of a large-scale disaster, analysis of respondents' migratory intentions is conducted as three discrete time periods (19 days, 3 months, and 1 year following the anthrax release) and treated as three unique decision frames. Our research assumes that each decision frame is contextually sensitive and qualitatively unique and focuses on the influence of the policy manipulations on cognitive and affective responses, as well as intentions to migrate within each time period.We anticipate that the type of government action and the extent of government commitment to that action provide important clues to the public as to the level of risk associated with a disaster. As such, we hypothesize that during the response phase, the stronger the risk signals demonstrated by government action, the more protected the population will feel and, in turn, the more likely they will be to remain in the region. Conversely, during the recovery phase, greater government involvement implies too much protection at a time when the situation is expected to be more manageable. As a result, the residents will perceive government actions as an indicator that the region is unsafe and in turn are more likely to migrate out of the area.We also believe that while the manipulations shape migration decisions, changes in beliefs and affect are potential mediating variables for explaining migration intentions at various post-event points in time. We expect that following the anthrax release, government policies signaling high risk will result in more negative reactions to the situation, as well as attenuated beliefs about personal safety and government confidence. Such reaction to the uncertain and unpredictable consequences of anthrax is believed to contribute to increased intentions to leave the region. Yet, as evidence of recovery increases and risk signals dissipate, public confidence is expected to grow, positive affect is predicted to increase, and negative affect is predicted to decrease, driving increased intention to remain and return to the region.The next section of this paper describes the anthrax release scenario simulation and details of the methodology used to gather respondents' emotions, beliefs, and migration decision making. Section 3 reports the findings of our experiment, emphasizing the recovery phase of the scenario. Section 4 summarizes our findings and discusses how government policies and actions impact respondents' migratory decisions following an anthrax release.", "citance": "Furthermore, once dispersed, anthrax spores are very difficult to dispose of and may remain deadly until the affected area-especially indoor areas-can be decontaminated (Weis et al. 2002) .", "claims": [{"text": "Anthrax spores are only deadly for a short period of time after dispersal.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Anthrax spores are very difficult to dispose once they are dispersed.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Anthrax spores can be disposed of easily after they are dispersed.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Anthrax spores remain deadly until affected areas are decontaminated.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Tract-based spatial statistics analyses with multiple diffusion tensor imaging-derived indices [fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), axial diffusivity (AD)] were employed collectively to investigate WM integrity between all patients with MWoA and all healthy controls, between each subgroup (SDS (-) group and SDS (+) group) and healthy controls, and between the SDS (-) and SDS (+) groups. Compared with healthy controls, decreased AD was shown in several WM tracts of the whole MWoA group, SDS (-) group and SDS (+) group. In addition, compared with the SDS (-) group, the SDS (+) group showed decreased FA and increased MD and RD, with conserved AD, including the genu, body and splenium of the corpus callosum, bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculi, the right anterior corona radiata and some other WM tracts, similar to previous findings in depression disorder. Furthermore, mean FA and RD in some of the above-mentioned WM tracts in the SDS (+) group were correlated significantly with SDS scores, including the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum, the right anterior corona radiata and the superior longitudinal fasciculi. Our results suggest that WM integrity may be affected by both depression symptoms (more sensitive as RD) and migraine (more sensitive as AD). The findings may serve as a sensitive biomarker of depression severity in MWoA.", "citation_paragraph": "To further investigate the association between the WM abnormalities and depression symptoms in MWoA, a partial correlation analysis controlling for age was carried out. Our results demonstrated that the average FA and RD values of overlapped regions, including the genu and splenium of the CC, bilateral SLF and right ACR, were correlated significantly with the SDS scores in MWoA (Fig. 3) . We suggest that migraine and depression symptoms in migraine are linked to different diffusion characteristics of WM, which may be a biomarker of alterations in functional, clinical, behavioral or emotional measures in patients with MWoA (10). This may indicate that demyelination, as opposed to abnormalities in axonal loss, might occur more frequently in MWoA with more severe current depression symptoms. The relationship between symptom severity and WM integrity was more significant in the genu and splenium of the CC, bilateral SLF and right ACR. In particular, the negative correlation between the decreased integrity of the CC and depression severity was consistent with a previous migraine study (16) and depression studies (63) .Our results may provide considerably greater precision for the characterization of the regions involved in depression severity in MWoA. Given the decreased AD and increased RD in multiple brain regions, our findings suggest that migraine and depression may affect the WM in similar regions, but with dissimilar types of change (axial or radial). If WM integrity is measurably plastic and related to both migraine and depression symptom severity, this may serve as a sensitive biomarker to reflect pain progression and depression severity of MWoA, and may have potential use in diagnosis, monitoring and assessment in a clinical setting. Successful treatment in depressive disorder or migraine might be accompanied by a normalization of WM integrity, as reported in several structural and functional MRI studies (63, 80, 81) . Similarly, our results might help us to understand how antidepressants help to reduce the severity of migraine or to prevent migraine (82) . With regard to migraine, interactive effects with multiple therapies may be more beneficial than a single treatment (3, 83) . In future studies, depressive symptoms in migraine should be considered as a bias to affect WM integrity. The previous findings in migraine (17, (34) (35) (36) (37) (40) (41) (42) should be re-tested to avoid bias caused by depression symptoms.", "citance": "Similarly, our results might help us to understand how antidepressants help to reduce the severity of migraine or to prevent migraine (82) .", "claims": [{"text": "Antidepressants increase the severity of migraines.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Antidepressants reduce the severity of migraines.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

One of the more alarming recent trends in infectious diseases has been the increasing frequency of antimicrobial resistance among microbial pathogens causing nosocomial and community-acquired infections. Numerous classes of antimicrobial agents have now become less effective as a result of the effective pressure of antimicrobial usage [2] . This resistance problem provides an impetus for further attempts to search for new antimicrobial agents from other sources to combat infections and overcome the problems of resistance and side effects of the currently available antimicrobials. Crude extracts of medicinal plants stand out as veritable sources of potential resistance modifying agents and the Indian biosphere promises to be a potential source of such compounds owing to its rich plant species diversity.Among the infectious diseases, urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the second most common type of infections in the body accounting for morbidity and mortality in all the human populations from neonate to the geriatric age group. A high level of antibiotic resistance is very significant in uropathogenic bacteria especially Escherichia coli, the main aetiological agent of UTIs. It has developed resistance to conventional antibiotics including extended spectrum cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones and carbapenem [3, 4] . Other commonly found bacteria which causes urinary tract infections includes Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and others [5] .Terminalia chebula Retz. (Fam. Combretaceae), is a medicinal plant with diverse beneficial effects on human health because of its extraordinary power of healing [6] [7] [8] .Although numerous studies have shown antimicrobial activity of T. chebula fruit extracts against a number of microorganisms [9] [10] [11] [12] , but systematic and methodical investigations on antimicrobial potential of T. chebula fruit extracts against multidrug-resistant uropathogens Tibet and is always listed at the top of the list of \"Ayurvedic Materia Medica\" because of its extraordinary power of healing. The present study was carried out to evaluate the possible in vitro antibacterial potential of different solvent extracts of T. chebula fruit against multidrug-resistant uropathogens. Methods: A total of 52 multidrug-resistant uropathogenic bacteria were used in this study. Successive extractions of T. chebula fruits were performed with solvents of different polarities. Agar well diffusion and microbroth dilution assay methods were used for antibacterial susceptibility testing. Kill-kinetics study was done to know the rate and extent of bacterial killing. Qualitative phytochemical screening was done to know the major phytoconstituents present in the plant material. Acute oral toxicity study in mice was performed to evaluate the toxic potential of the plant material, if any. Results: The ethanol extract of T. chebula fruits demonstrated a strong antimicrobial activity against all the test isolates and found to be most effective over others. Kill-kinetics study showed dose and time dependent antibacterial activity of ethanol extract. Phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of high concentration of phenolics and low concentration of flavonoids and terpenoids. In acute oral toxicity study, no gross behavioral changes were observed in mice at recommended dosage level and 24 h LD 50 of ethanol extract was found to be >4 g/kg, p.o. in mice. Conclusions: The results provide justification for the use of Terminalia chebula fruit in folk medicine to treat various infectious diseases and could be useful for the development of alternative/ complementary medicine for multidrug-resistant uropathogens.Contents lists available at ScienceDirect seems to be dubious. The present investigation has therefore been designed to study the in vitro antibacterial potential of T. chebula fruit extracts against multidrugresistant uropathogens with a view to develop an effective and practically non-toxic drug-resistance modifying antimicrobial agent from plant origin for the treatment of urinary tract infections caused by these drug-resistant bacterial pathogens and also to overcome the problems of toxic side effects of conventional antibiotics.", "citance": "Numerous classes of antimicrobial agents have now become less effective as a result of the effective pressure of antimicrobial usage [2] .", "claims": [{"text": "Antimicrobial agents are less effective due to the pressure of antimicrobial usage.", "subject": "antimicrobial", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Antimicrobial agents are more effective due to the pressure of antimicrobial usage.", "subject": "antimicrobial", "is_negation": true}]}
{"s2orc_id": 7653363, "title": "The rise and fall of tuberculosis in Malawi: associations with HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy", "abstract": "OBJECTIVES Since 1985, Malawi has experienced a dual epidemic of HIV and tuberculosis (TB) which has been moderated recently by the advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART). The aim of this study was to describe the association over several decades between HIV/AIDS, the scale-up of ART and TB case notifications.   METHODS Aggregate data were extracted from annual reports of the National TB Control Programme, the Ministry of Health HIV Department and the National Statistics Office. ART coverage was calculated using the total HIV population as denominator (derived from UNAIDS Spectrum software).   RESULTS In 1970, there were no HIV-infected persons but numbers had increased to a maximum of 1.18 million by 2014. HIV prevalence reached a maximum of 10.8% in 2000, thereafter decreasing to 7.5% by 2014. Numbers alive on ART increased from 2586 in 2003 to 536 527 (coverage 45.3%) by 2014. In 1985, there were 5286 TB cases which reached a maximum of 28 234 in 2003 and then decreased to 17 723 by 2014 (37% decline from 2003). There were increases in all types of new TB between 1998-2003 which then declined by 30% for extrapulmonary TB, by 37% for new smear-positive PTB and by 50% for smear-negative PTB. Previously treated TB cases reached a maximum of 3443 in 2003 and then declined by 42% by 2014.   CONCLUSION The rise and fall of TB in Malawi between 1985 and 2014 was strongly associated with HIV infection and ART scale-up; this has implications for ending the TB epidemic in high HIV-TB burden countries.", "citation_paragraph": "While causality cannot be proven in an ecological study such as this, the decline in the burden of TB is likely to be due to the protective effects of ART against TB. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 studies involving cohorts of PLHIV from around the world has shown that ART significantly reduces rates of TB across a broad range of CD4 strata by a factor of 65%, this being most noticeable in patients with advanced HIV disease or low CD4 counts [20] . In sub-Saharan Africa, smear-negative PTB is particularly associated with HIV infection and advanced immune suppression, and it is with this type of disease in Malawi that the most marked changes have occurred over the last 30 years. Recurrent TB is also a feature of HIV coinfection, with a decline in cases also observed in a rural district of Malawi several years ago in association with the scale-up of ART [21] . Recurrent TB may be due to reactivation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis which has not been cleared by the previous treatment or due to a new infection with another strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis as a result of new exposure and transmission in the community. The immune status of the host, and particularly the CD4 cell count, is crucial for maintaining protection against TB whether this is due to preventing reactivation or preventing progression from new infection to active disease. Given the rationale for how ART works by immune reconstitution with elevation of CD4 cell counts, the effects of ART in reducing recurrent TB are therefore not surprising as over the last 10 years the proportion of HIVinfected TB patients started on ART at the start of TB treatment has gradually increased to exceed 80% [14] . There are a number of important programmatic implications from this study. First, Malawi needs to continue with scaling up ART to reach 100% of its HIV-infected population not only as a means of controlling the HIV epidemic but also the TB epidemic. The joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) launch of the new 90-90-90 treatment targets for HIV should provide countries like Malawi with the necessary impetus to move in this direction [22] . These targets specify that by 2020, 90% of individuals living with HIV will be diagnosed and know their HIV status, 90% of people with diagnosed HIV infection will receive sustained ART, and 90% of those on ART will be virally suppressed. These targets are important because they focus on the majority of PLHIV learning their HIV status and they advocate for early treatment by indicating that the majority of those starting ART are alive and retained on therapy sometime in the future. In this regard, Malawi pioneered the Option B+ approach in 2011 whereby HIV-infected women who are pregnant or breastfeeding can start ART for life regardless of CD4 cell count or WHO clinical stage [23] , and, in line with recent WHO guidance on when to start ART [24] , the country is preparing to start all HIV-infected people on ART in the near future. Recent studies have highlighted the TB preventive benefits of early start of ART, emphasising that delays in ART initiation when CD4 cell counts have dropped <200 cells/ ll may result in long-term immune dysfunction and persistent increased risk for TB [25, 26] .Second, in terms of TB prevention, ART is not enough on its own; in high HIV-TB burden settings, the risk of tuberculosis in HIV-TB-infected individuals on ART never decreases to a level seen in patients without HIV infection [27] . Thus, other interventions may be necessary such as isoniazid preventive therapy. Observational studies from Brazil [28] , South Africa [29] and a trial in Botswana [30] , all suggest that sequential or concurrent use of ART and isoniazid preventive therapy have additive effects in reducing the risk of active TB. A randomised placebo-controlled study in South Africa showed that isoniazid preventive therapy given for 12 months to PLHIV and on ART significantly reduced the risk of active TB by 37% [31] , and results from the TEMPRANO study in Cote d'Ivoire showed similar effects of isoniazid preventive therapy when added to ART [32] . Malawi needs to take these findings into consideration and think seriously about the benefits and risks of including isoniazid preventive therapy into its ART scale-up programme.Third, attention needs to be paid to effective implementation of currently available strategies and tools for TB control: prompt and accurate diagnosis, effective treatment started immediately after diagnosis and good infection control practices in health facilities and wherever people with HIV and TB congregate [33] . WHO has launched a post-2015 bold new patient-centred strategy that if followed by countries could result in elimination of TB by 2050 [34] .Finally, while this study shows the strong association between HIV and TB, it is important to note the growing association and important links between these two communicable diseases and non-communicable diseases such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension [35] . Communicable and non-communicable diseases occur within the same patient populations, and as we move forward in 2016 to the new era of the Sustainable Development Goals [36] , it will be vital to secure the political and programmatic commitment at international and national levels for integrated and effective action to address them.In conclusion, this paper reports on the rise and fall of TB in Malawi between 1985 and 2014, notes the strong association between HIV infection and the scale-up of ART and highlights ways forward to end the epidemic.", "citance": "A systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 studies involving cohorts of PLHIV from around the world has shown that ART significantly reduces rates of TB across a broad range of CD4 strata by a factor of 65%, this being most noticeable in patients with advanced HIV disease or low CD4 counts [20] .", "claims": [{"text": "Antiretroviral therapy increases rates of tuberculosis across a broad range of CD4 strata.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Antiretroviral therapy reduces rates of tuberculosis across a broad range of CD4 strata.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Here, for the first time, susceptibility to reinfection has been linked to host cytokine responses. Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura abundance was assessed immediately before and 8-9 months after deworming in a Cameroonian population (starting n=191). Profiles of whole-blood cytokine responses to parasite antigens (for interleukin [IL]-5, IL-13, IL-10, IL-12p40, tumor necrosis factor- alpha , and interferon- gamma), assayed before treatment, were significantly related both to an overall measure of host susceptibility and to susceptibility to reinfection. Significant effects were primarily due to a negative association between IL-13 and IL-5 responses and infection. Persistently susceptible individuals were, therefore, characterized by a weak T helper cell type 2 response. The apparent plasticity of age-specific cytokine response-worm abundance relationships between different populations is also discussed.", "citation_paragraph": "Turner et al. [5] have suggested that Th2 cytokines are important in human immune responses controlling GI nematode infections to subpathogenic levels and might, therefore, be associated with a level of resistance to reinfection. The present results have corroborated this hypothesis in a population in Nyomo, Cameroon, exposed to A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura.When age and sex were accounted for, Th2 cytokine responses immediately before deworming had a significant negative effect on the probability of reinfection 8-9 months later. There was a highly significant individual effect for IL-5. This demonstrates, for the first time in humans, a relationship between past cytokine expression patterns in infected individuals and future susceptibility to GI nematodes. It provides a mechanistic explanation for persistent susceptibility as being due, at least partly, to variation in Th2-driven immune responses.When age and sex were accounted for, a measure of overall susceptibility to GI nematodes was also significantly related to Th2 cytokine response in 4-13-year-old hosts. With respect to individual cytokines, IL-13 response was significantly negatively related to overall susceptibility, with a marginally nonsignificant negative effect for IL-5. These results strongly validate the relevance of murine models that have indicated a causal link between Th2 responses and resistance to GI nematodes [4, 15] . Although the way in which Th2 cytokines coordinate this control is not fully resolved, and although different mechanisms may be important in different murine models, the induction of mast cells, eosinophils, IgE, and IgA can be involved [16] . Key effector mechanisms within the intestinal mucosa can include T cell-and mast cell-driven increases in epithelial permeability, muscle hypercontractility, and mucus production [16, 17] .Relationships between cytokine variation and susceptibility were detected within different age ranges in the Nyomo population and in another study of A. lumbricoides infection in Ay\u00e9n\u00e9, Cameroon [5] . In Ay\u00e9n\u00e9, significant negative association between Th2 cytokines and infection level was observed only in an older (12-36 years) age class. In the present analysis, negative effects were strongest in a younger (4-13 years) age class. The age dependence of cytokine-response profiles also differed in Nyomo. Here, when the full cytokine data set was considered and no adjustment was made for nematode infection, Th2 responses to parasite-derived antigen decreased in older hosts. Adjustment for GI nematode susceptibility (across the subset of individuals for whom parasite data were available) suggested a curvilinear relationship, with Th2 cytokine expression increasing weakly until age 18 years, then decreasing. In the full cytokine data set unadjusted for nematode infection, inflammatory responses primarily associated with TNF-a expression were only marginally influenced by age. However, adjustment for GI nematode susceptibility suggested a curvilinear relationship, with expression increasing to its highest levels above age 30 years. In Ay\u00e9n\u00e9 (not considering the effects of nematode infection), Th2 cytokine responses were more frequent, and proinflammatory IFN-g responses were less frequent, in hosts 112 years old (although there were no differences in absolute levels of cytokine production between the age classes). Correspondingly, Faulkner et al. [8] , in a study of 7-12-year-old hosts with respect to T. trichiura antigen at Ay\u00e9n\u00e9, found very weak Th2 cytokine responses in this age group. Bancroft et al. [18] have shown that transmission regime may affect host cytokine-response profiles in the T. muris-murine model. It is possible, then, that interpopulation differences may arise from variation in age-specific infection pressure or from the historical dynamics of infection. A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura intensities were much greater in Ay\u00e9n\u00e9 (overall arithmetic mean FEC, 17,343 vs. 5568 for A. lumbricoides and 7939 vs. 960 for T. trichiura). Perhaps high infection pressure in Ay\u00e9n\u00e9 produced greater pathogenic damage and stimulated stronger proinflammatory responses in young hosts. Effective Th2-polarized responses may, in this case, have been suppressed in the hosts in the 2-11-year-old age class, only to develop more slowly in older hosts. However, it is equally possible that the observed interlocality differences in cytokine responsiveness could have been driven by unmeasured environmental influences, including infections with other parasites, bacteria, or viruses.These observations could have implications for deworming strategies. Although antiworm treatment could have benefits in terms of the removal of pathological effects [19] and perhaps increased growth and cognitive ability in children [20] [21] [22] ; but see 23] , there may also be immunological consequences. Helminths can modulate host immune responses to concurrent infections [24] and vaccination [25] [26] [27] , and it has been suggested that antiworm drug treatment could influence host responsiveness to other pathogens [28] [29] [30] . Such effects are likely mediated by worm-induced changes in the host cytokine environment. Helminthiases typically result in T cell hyporesponsiveness and a bias toward Th2 responses [31] . Because of the anti-inflammatory nature of these changes, the balance between beneficial and immunopathological inflammatory responses toward bystander infections could be affected by deworming treatment. The present results suggest that the context in which antiworm treatment occurs (i.e., in terms of the cytokine environment in wormy hosts) might vary with host age and between populations. On the basis of a comparison with the study of Turner et al. [5] , patterns of cytokine expression at the population level are plastic, with different age-dependent trends at different localities. Local conditions could, thus, be of great importance in determining the potential effects of treatment. For instance, it might be speculated that, in Ay\u00e9n\u00e9, a successful deworming program in children !11 years old (who have stronger inflammatory responses than do adults) might increase the children's subsequent risk of immunopathological damage. In Nyomo, however, children develop Th2-skewed responses earlier and might be affected by treatment in a different way.In conclusion, our results from Nyomo support an inverse association between Th2 cytokines and overall susceptibility to GI nematodes in younger (4-13-year-old) hosts. This finding is consistent with effects observed in animal models and in previous studies of human populations. Furthermore, an association has been shown between Th2 responses and reinfection: pretreatment levels of IL-5 in infected hosts were positively related to resistance 8-9 months later. Future patterns of susceptibility may, thus, be predicted by past Th2 responsiveness.Comparison of the present results to those found in another Cameroonian population also suggests that age-specific cytokine-response patterns to GI nematodes vary between localities. Intermittent antihelmintic treatment could, therefore, produce unpredictable effects on the development of cytokine regulatory networks in different populations, with possible consequences for bystander infections.", "citance": "Although antiworm treatment could have benefits in terms of the removal of pathological effects [19] and perhaps increased growth and cognitive ability in children [20] [21] [22] ; but see 23] , there may also be immunological consequences.", "claims": [{"text": "Antiworm treatment decreases cognitive ability in children.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Antiworm treatment increases cognitive ability in children.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 37088265, "title": "Structure-function relationship of CAP-Gly domains", "abstract": "In all eukaryotes, CAP-Gly proteins control important cellular processes. The molecular mechanisms underlying the functions of CAP-Gly domains, however, are still poorly understood. Here we use the complex formed between the CAP-Gly domain of p150glued and the C-terminal zinc knuckle of CLIP170 as a model system to explore the structure-function relationship of CAP-Gly\u2013mediated protein interactions. We demonstrate that the conserved GKNDG motif of CAP-Gly domains is responsible for targeting to the C-terminal EEY/F sequence motifs of CLIP170, EB proteins and microtubules. The CAP-Gly\u2013EEY/F interaction is essential for the recruitment of the dynactin complex by CLIP170 and for activation of CLIP170. Our findings define the molecular basis of CAP-Gly domain function, including the tubulin detyrosination-tyrosination cycle. They further establish fundamental roles for the interaction between CAP-Gly proteins and C-terminal EEY/F sequence motifs in regulating complex and dynamic cellular processes.", "citation_paragraph": "The minimum core of the p150 glued -CLIP170 complex has been mapped to the N-terminal CAP-Gly domain of p150 glued , denoted p150n, and the C-terminal domain of CLIP170, which harbors two tandem repeated zinc-knuckle motifs 18, 19 . To test the properties of p150n binding to the isolated zinc knuckles (ClipZn1 and ClipZn2) and tandem repeated zinc knuckles (ClipZn12), we performed ITC studies at 25 1C. No binding was observed between p150n and ClipZn1 ( Table 1) , in agreement with previous results 18, 19 . In contrast, ITC analysis of p150n-ClipZn2 yielded a binding isotherm that suggests a stoichiometry for the complex of 1 mol p150n/1 mol ClipZn2 (Fig. 1a , left graph). The K d of p150n-ClipZn2 was determined to be 2 mM. A similar K d value was obtained for p150n-ClipZn12 ( Table 1) . Static light-scattering experiments with p150n and ClipZn2 yielded average molecular masses of 10.6 and 5.7 kDa, respectively (data not shown), consistent with the calculated masses of the monomers (10.2 and 4.8 kDa, respectively). Analysis of equimolar mixtures of p150n and ClipZn2 yielded an average molecular mass of 14.1 kDa. This value suggests the formation of a complex with a molar p150n/ClipZn2 ratio of 1:1, consistent with the ITC analysis. Together, these data show that the second zinc knuckle of Clip170 is both necessary and sufficient for binding to the CAP-Gly domain of p150 glued and that these two domains form a heterodimer in solution.To further characterize the p150n-ClipZn2 complex, we determined its structure by X-ray crystallography to 2.6-\u00c5 resolution. The overall structure reveals a heterodimeric complex formed between one p150n and one ClipZn2 molecule (Fig. 1b) , consistent with the solution data (see above). The asymmetric unit of the crystal contains four copies of the complex with nearly identical main chain and side chain conformations (r.m.s. deviation for all atoms equals 0.3 \u00c5 ). The p150n subunit has all the features of the CAP-Gly fold 14, 15 and is very similar to its free, uncomplexed form (PDB 2HKN; r.m.s. deviation for all atoms equals 0.4 \u00c5 ). The structure of the ClipZn2 subunit is composed of two short b-strands followed by a short loop and an extended C terminus. The main chain of the N-terminal moiety of ClipZn2 wraps around a metal ion that is coordinated by a CCHC side chain motif (Fig. 1b) , an arrangement characteristic of zinc-finger domains found in retroviral nucleocapsid proteins 26 . The presence of a zinc ion was confirmed using X-ray fluorescence scans of p150n-ClipZn2 crystals at the absorption edge of zinc (data not shown).Analysis of the p150n-ClipZn2 binding interface reveals two distinct contact sites, A and B (Fig. 1c) . Contact A involves residues from a distinct groove shaped by a number of hydrophobic and polar side chains of p150n and the last five C-terminal residues of ClipZn2 (Figs. 2 and 3). This short ClipZn2 sequence stretch, DDETF, assumes an extended conformation and packs against the b6 strand of p150n in an antiparallel fashion. The Phe1427 side chain is inserted at one end of the p150n groove and packs against the side chains of Phe52, Trp57, Val73 and Phe88. Its terminal a-carboxylate group, COO -, forms hydrogen bonds with the Nd2 side chain atom of Asn69 and the main chain NH of Phe88. An additional main chain-main chain hydrogen bond is established between the NH of Phe1427 and the oxygen of Phe88. Lys68 and Val89 of p150n form hydrogen bonds and a hydrophobic contact to the side chain and main chain of ClipZn2 Thr1426. This interaction network is completed by additional contacts between Ser92 and Gln93 of p150n and Asp1423 of ClipZn2 (Fig.  2a,b) . Deleting the last three C-terminal residues of ClipZn2 abolished binding of the mutant fragment, ClipZn2DC, to p150n, demonstrating that the ClipZn2 tail is essential for complex formation (Fig. 1a , left graph, and Table 1) .Contact B involves residues from the b2-b3 and b6-b7 loops of p150n and the zinc-binding domain of ClipZn2 (residues 1406-1427; Fig. 1b,c) . The guanidinium group of Arg90 of p150n forms an intramolecular arginine-p stacking interaction with Trp57; it is within van der Waals distance of the Sg atom of ClipZn2 Cys1411, makes an intermolecular water-mediated hydrogen bonding contact to the main chain oxygen of Asn1422 and is in position to form a putative longrange attractive electrostatic interaction with the CCHC-zinc ion cluster. Furthermore, the aliphatic moiety of Arg90 packs against Ile1410 of ClipZn2. Additional contacts are formed between Thr54, Gly55, Lys56 and Gln91 of p150n, and Met1413 and Glu1412 of ClipZn2 (Fig. 2b,c) .Probing the p150n-ClipZn2 interaction by mutagenesis Most contacting residues seen at the p150n-ClipZn2 complex interface are highly conserved in CAP-Gly domains of p150 glued and in zinc knuckles of CLIP170 metazoan orthologs, suggesting that the p150 glued -CLIP170 binding mode is well conserved across evolution (Fig. 2d,e) . However, many of these residues are not conserved in unrelated CAP-Gly domain-containing proteins (Fig. 3a) . On the basis of our alignments and structural information (Figs. 2 and 3) , we chose to target specific conserved and variable residues for mutagenesis. The binding properties of the resulting variants were assessed by ITC, and the resulting K d values are summarized in Table 1 .Mutation of either Lys68 and Asn69 within the GKNDG motif, which is highly conserved in many CAP-Gly domains 14 , to alanine (p150n(K68A) and p150n(N69A)) reduced the binding affinity of these p150n mutant proteins for ClipZn2 B50-fold (Fig. 1a, right  graph) . The double mutation in p150n(K68A N69A) essentially abolished complex formation. These findings demonstrate the importance of the Lys-Asn dipeptide segment of the GKNDG motif in recognizing the C-terminal DDETF sequence of ClipZn2. Notably, mutating Asn69 to histidine (p150n(N69H)), as observed in the CAP-Gly domains of CLIPR59 and a-tubulin chaperone cofactor E (Fig. 3a) , did not alter the affinity of the p150n mutant. Consistent with this observation, modeling indicates that the hydrogen bonding of Asn69 to the COO -group of ClipZn2 can also be established by a histidine side chain. Gln93 of p150n, which contacts Asp1423 of DDETF, is not conserved in CAP-Gly domain homologs. Instead, the corresponding sequence position shows a strong preference for basic residues (Fig. 3a) . Modeling suggests that a basic residue in p150n may favorably interact with Asp1423 orAsp1424 of ClipZn2, or both (Fig. 2b) . In support of this prediction, we found that replacing Gln93 with either lysine (p150n(Q93K)) or arginine (p150n(Q93R)) increased the binding affinity of these p150n mutant proteins for ClipZn2 about six-fold (Fig. 1a, left graph) . This finding suggests that the nature of the residue occupying position 93 modulates the affinity of CAP-Gly domains for C-terminal acidic-aromatic sequence motifs.Arg90, which is highly conserved in p150 glued orthologs, seems to be important for ClipZn2 zinc-knuckle binding. However, the residue is not well conserved in CAP-Gly domain homologs; some CLIPs contain a proline or a serine at the corresponding position (Fig. 3a) . Replacing Arg90 with these residues resulted in a 4100-fold reduction in binding affinity of the mutant p150n proteins, p150n(R90P) and p150n(R90S), for ClipZn2 (Fig. 1a, right graph) . Substituting histidine or aspartate for the conserved Ile1410 of ClipZn2 contacted by Arg90 (Fig. 2b) reduced binding affinity of the mutant domains, ClipZn2(I1410H) and ClipZn2(I1410D), for p150n about ten-fold. These findings underscore the key role of p150n Arg90 in binding the zinc-knuckle moiety of ClipZn2. An arginine residue at position 90 has also been found to be important for the interaction between p150n and the acidic C-terminal tail of EB1, denoted EB1c 16, 17 .Functional analysis of the p150n-ClipZn2 interaction Previous work has shown the importance of the CLIP170 zinc-knuckle domain for recruitment of endogenous dynactin to CLIP170-decorated microtubules or microtubule tips 18, 19 . Such recruitment can be readily observed in CLIP170-overexpressing cells, in which dynactin relocates to CLIP170-induced microtubule bundles Bold red, residues that interact in our p150n-ClipZn2 structure; bold black, conservation of these residues. Human p150 glued and CLIP170 position numbers are indicated above the alignments.

To test this hypothesis, we attached a cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) tag to the C terminus of CLIP170, reasoning that this bulky protein moiety should interfere with the interaction of the DDETF tail with the CAP-Gly domain of p150 glued . Indeed, placement of a CFP tag at the extreme C terminus of CLIP170 completely blocked dynactin recruitment to CLIP170-associated bundles (Fig. 4c) . In contrast, when the CFP tag was inserted upstream of the zinc-knuckle domains, so that the DDETF tail was not occluded, robust binding of dynactin to CLIP170-induced microtubule bundles was observed (Fig. 4d) . Deletion of the DDETF sequence also abolished dynactin association with the CLIP170-bundled microtubules ( Fig. 4e) . Together, these data suggest that the C-terminal DDETF sequence segment is important for CLIP170-mediated dynactin localization in cells.", "citance": "An arginine residue at position 90 has also been found to be important for the interaction between p150n and the acidic C-terminal tail of EB1, denoted EB1c 16, 17 .Functional analysis of the p150n-ClipZn2 interaction Previous work has shown the importance of the CLIP170 zinc-knuckle domain for recruitment of endogenous dynactin to CLIP170-decorated microtubules or microtubule tips 18, 19 .", "claims": [{"text": "Arginine 90 in p150n is important for interaction with EB1.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

This study was performed to determine whether PD-ECGF/TP can be used to ameliorate chronic myocardial ischemia. Myocardial ischemia was created in 40 mongrel dogs by placement of an ameroid constrictor on the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). Plasmid vector encoding human PD-ECGF/TP cDNA (pCIhTP group; n = 12), empty vector pCI (pCI group; n = 12), or saline (Saline group; n = 12) was directly injected into the LAD territory 3 wk after ameroid constrictor implantation. Myocardial blood flow was detected using PET at baseline, 3 wk after ameroid constrictor implantation, and 2 wk after therapeutic treatment. At the end of the experiment, the hearts were isolated for biological and histological analysis. In the pCIhTP group, the transfected heart strongly expressed PD-ECGF/TP. The size of the infarct was smaller in the pCIhTP group than in the pCI or Saline group. The number of apoptotic myocardial cells was decreased in the pCIhTP group compared with the control groups based on triple immunohistochemical staining for von Willebrand factor, alpha-actin smooth muscle cells, and single-strand DNA. The level of proapoptotic protein Bax markedly decreased in the pCIhTP group compared with the other groups. Double immunohistochemical staining for von Willebrand factor and alpha-actin smooth muscle cells demonstrated that angiogenesis and arteriogenesis occurred, and paralleled the changes in myocardial blood flow and myocardial function in the pCIhTP group. We conclude that genetic approaches using PD-ECGF/TP to target the myocardium are effective for alleviating chronic myocardial ischemia.", "citation_paragraph": "was measured with the use of a PET scanner (model SHR7700, Hamamatsu). After a 30-min transmission scan, 31-frame dynamic PET imaging (10 \u03eb 2 min frames) of the heart was performed using [ 13 N]ammonia (15.4 \u03ee 0.328 mCi). Myocardial ischemia was defined by absolute values for MBF that were reduced for the left ventricular wall supplied by the LAD. The analysis of PET images was conducted using an image analysis package (Dr. View) and a special, dedicated software package. The PET images were reoriented into short-axis images for all sets. Myocardial regions of interest were drawn in the territories of the LAD and LCx, and tracer uptake in each region was measured and expressed as the ratio of LAD/LCx. Eight dogs in the pCIhTP and pCI groups were used in this experiment.Molecular analyses. Total DNA and RNA were isolated from canine myocardium. Three micrograms of DNA were subjected to PCR using primers corresponding to sequences within the pCI plasmid (forward, 5\u0408-ACTGACATCCACTTTGCCTTTCTCT-3\u0408) and the human PD-ECGF/TP cDNA (reverse, 5\u0408-CTTACTGAGAATGGAG-GCTGTGATG-3\u0408), generating an 822-bp product that represented transgenic PD-ECGF/TP DNA. One microgram of RNA was treated with DNase (Sigma) and used for first-strand cDNA synthesis by using the First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche Diagnostics) as described by the manufacturer. The forward primer (5\u0408-GCACCTT-GGATAAGCTGGAGT-3\u0408) and reverse primer (5\u0408-GAGAATG-GAGGCTGTGATGAG-3\u0408) bind to conserved regions of the human PD-ECGF/TP cDNA, generating a 202-bp product that represents human PD-ECGF/TP transcripts. The Advantage II PCR Kit (Clontech) was used for this protocol. To document that there were similar amounts of DNA or RNA in each lane, PCR for canine \u2424-actin also was performed. Myocardial protein was extracted as described previously (20) . Western blot analysis was performed with the use of antibodies against human thymidine phosphorylase (654-1, mouse monoclonal antibody, Roche), Bcl-2 (Pharmingen), and Bax (Pharmingen). In addition, blots were probed with an actin (Sigma) antibody as a loading control. PD-ECGF/TP activity was detected as described previously (20) .Histological analysis. Serial 4-to 5-m-thick sections were cut and routine histological staining was performed with hematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome stain. Standard immunohistochemical staining using the 654-1 antibody was performed to detect PD-ECGF/TP expression at the injection sites. Double immunohistochemical staining was performed with the use of von Willebrand factor (vWF; polyclonal rabbit anti human antibody, A0082, Dako, Japan) and \u2423-actin smooth muscle cells (\u2423-actin SMC, mouse anti-human monoclonal antibody, M0851, Dako) antibody to identify microvessel density and microvessel characterization. To determine the type of the cells undergoing apoptosis induced by ischemia, we stained tissue from the LAD area using a triple immunohistochemical staining technique for single-strand DNA (ssDNA; A4506, Dako), vWF, and \u2423-actin SMC. ssDNA is a specific and sensitive cellular marker of apoptosis, and this antibody differentiates apoptosis from necrosis and identifies cells in the early stages of apoptosis (9) . Nuclei were stained with hematoxylin.Microvessel density count and microvessel type analysis. Myocardial infarction is frequently heterogeneous in dogs and formed by complex interdigitations between necrotic and viable areas. Therefore, five subepicardial and five subendocardial cross-sectioned regions were randomly selected for analysis in each dog heart. Three researchers blinded to the group division performed the counting, and the average values were used for statistical analysis (20, 21) . Microvessel densities are expressed as microvessel numbers per square millimeter. Capillaries were identified as a single layer of vWF-positive endothelial cells (\u03eb200 magnification, inside diameter \u054510 m). Arterioles were identified as having an inside diameter \u054610 m and an \u2423-actin SMC-positive layer (\u03eb200 magnification). Venules were differentiated from arterioles by their large lumen diameter compared with vessel wall thickness, a thinner or absent smooth muscle layer, a less significant tunica adventitia, and an inner diameter of \u054610 m (15) .Apoptotic cell type analysis. Five randomly selected areas of ssDNA-positive cells in each dog were photographed (\u03eb200 magnification), and the number of ssDNA-positive cells and total number of nuclei in the same area were counted using Mac Scope software (Mitani). The percentage of ssDNA-positive cells relative to the total number of nuclei was used for statistical analysis. Furthermore, apoptotic endothelial cells (ssDNA-and vWF-positive cells), SMCs (ssDNA-and \u2423-actin SMC-positive cells), myocardium (not stained for vWF and \u2423-actin SMC, but having abundant cytosome and ssDNA-positive nuclei), and other cells (e.g., inflammatory cells) were compared among groups based on the triple-staining results and presented as the percentage of total nuclei.

This variability in prevalence of the syndrome is due to various logistical difficulties in diagnosing the syndrome and considerable heterogeneity in the presentation of symptoms resulting in lack of agreement over the diagnostic criteria used to define the condition. PCOS has an uncertain aetiology with recent studies pointing to a strong genetic basis [5, 6] . Some of the principal symptoms of PCOS include oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, anovulation leading to infertility, high androgen levels resulting in acne and hirsutism, tendency towards obesity, insulin resistance, and evidence of multiple cysts within the ovary. The phenotype varies widely depending on life stage, genotype, ethnicity and environmental factors including lifestyle and bodyweight. In United States about $4.36 billion is spent annually in diagnosis and treatment of the PCOS [7] . Studies conducted in families in which PCOS is prevalent also indicate the presence of chronic disease such as diabetes mellitus (DM) [8, 9] and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) [10, 11] . Now the question that needs to be answered is whether the prevalence of PCOS in women has any correlation with the occurrence of chronic disease within their families.A recent study in Australia based on a community based cohort using a defined sampling frame reported that the parents of women who had been diagnosed with PCOS were more subject to chronic diseases than parents of women who had never been diagnosed with PCOS [12] . Previous studies conducted in the first degree relatives of PCOS women have also revealed higher insulin resistance, serum androgen levels and type-2 diabetes as well as glucose tolerance disorder compared to the control groups [13, 14] . Together, the incidence of diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, and impaired fasting glucose was 40% in the mothers and 52% in the fathers of PCOS women [8] . Mothers, fathers, brothers, and sisters of PCOS women were found to have insulin resistance. In the family members of PCOS patients, hyperinsulinaemia and insulin resistance could act as important markers. Nowadays, PCOS has been acknowledged as a major risk factor for the development of type-2 diabetes.Low adiponectin levels were reported by Yilmaz et al. [8] in the first degree relatives of PCOS patients when compared to the age, sex and BMI (body mass index) matched controls. People with low adiponectin levels are at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Homocysteine (Hcy) is a non-protein amino acid formed during the breakdown of methionine. Previous studies have indicated that Hcy as an independent risk factor for CVD [15] . This was later confirmed by Loverro et al. [16] when they found that increased Hcy levels in individuals suffering from PCOS might predispose them to early atherosclerosis and CVD compared to healthy control subjects. Resistin, also known as adipose tissue-specific secretory factor (ADSF) is a cysteine-rich protein that in humans is encoded by the RETN gene. Resistin levels were found to be significantly high in PCOS groups of fathers and mothers compared to controls [8] and could play a key role in pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. Dyslipidaemia is the most common metabolic disorder in PCOS [17] and is an accepted risk factor for CVD. The occurrence of hypertension and hyperlipidaemia were found to be high in first degree relatives of individuals with PCOS [8] . Together, the results imply that low serum adiponectin, high homocystein and resistin levels in the first degree relatives of PCOS individuals could make them more prone to chronic diseases such as DM and CVD. There is a need for the first degree relatives of PCOS patients to be monitored for DM and CVD development and preventive measures to be taken.PCOS is a complex condition in women with manifestations across the lifespan and reflects a major health and economic burden in many countries. Therapy should target both short and longterm reproductive, metabolic and psychological aspects. Given the aetiological role of insulin resistance and the impact of obesity on both hyperinsulinaemia and hyperandrogenism, multidisciplinary lifestyle improvement aimed at normalizing insulin resistance, improving androgen status and aiding weight management is recognized as a critical initial treatment strategy.

{"s2orc_id": 55702269, "title": "Keeping ribosomal DNA intact: a repeating challenge", "abstract": "More than half of the human genome consists of repetitive sequences, with the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) representing two of the largest repeats. Repetitive rDNA sequences may form a threat to genomic integrity and cellular homeostasis due to the challenging aspects of their transcription, replication, and repair. Predisposition to cancer, premature aging, and neurological impairment in ataxia-telangiectasia and Bloom syndrome, for instance, coincide with increased cellular rDNA repeat instability. However, the mechanisms by which rDNA instability contributes to these hereditary syndromes and tumorigenesis remain unknown. Here, we review how cells govern rDNA stability and how rDNA break repair influences expansion and contraction of repeat length, a process likely associated with human disease. Recent advancements in CRISPR-based genome engineering may help to explain how cells keep their rDNA intact in the near future.", "citation_paragraph": "In eukaryotes, the copy number of rDNA repeats is higher than required to maintain rRNA synthesis. Many copies of rDNA genes are transcriptionally silenced via histone modification and/or methylation (Birch and Zomerdijk 2008) . The reason for this wide-spread redundancy is unclear; however, it is possible that certain specific cell types or developmental stages require increased levels of protein synthesis (Russell and Zomerdijk 2005) . The inactive fraction of rDNA is organized into a tightly packed, heterochromatic state that may be crucial for the structure of the nucleolus and regulation of rDNA transcription (Tsekrekou et al. 2017 ). Importantly, the packed state of rDNA heterochromatin could actually determine genomic instability as it is, on the one hand, less accessible to damaging metabolic by-products and, on the other hand, to proteins involved in recombination pathways. Moreover, it has been suggested that rDNA heterochromatin has a DNA damage signaling role: deletion of inactive rDNA copies may trigger a DNA damage response (DDR) followed by apoptosis or senescence (Kobayashi 2008; Paredes and Maggert 2009) . The loss of rDNA repeats, even if they are not actively transcribed (i.e., the redundant copies), has also been shown to sensitize cells to mutageninduced DNA damage (Xu et al. 2017a, b) . Recent evidence also suggests that reduction of ribosomal DNA repeats is a trait of human aging (Ganley and Kobayashi 2014; Tiku and Antebi 2018) . On the other hand, the contraction of rDNA copies has been proposed as a mechanism that overcomes replication stress conditions, acting as an adaptive cellular response, making it easier for cells with reduced rDNA repeats to complete DNA replication and continue cell cycle progression. Combined, these observations indicate that maintaining appropriate activity and numbers of rDNA repeats is highly controlled as loss of rDNA stability can be detrimental to cells and that replication and transcription are key aspects in the regulation of rDNA.Replication of ribosomal DNA Interestingly, not all rDNA repeats are replicated at the same time during S-phase. Actively transcribed repeats are replicated right after the initiation of DNA replication, whereas the silent repeats are replicated from mid to late S-phase (Dimitrova 2011; Schlesinger et al. 2009 ). In rDNA that is associated with the nucleolus, actively transcribed rDNA relocates transiently to the periphery of the nucleolar body for replication, possibly to avoid collisions between replication and transcription machineries (Kobayashi 2008) . In yeast, the nontranscribed spacer region of a rDNA repeat serves as a binding domain for the Fork blocking protein 1 (Fob1) and a localized increase of this protein is associated with a stronger replication block, to prevent clashes between rDNA transcription and the DNA replication machinery (Kobayashi 2003; Castan et al. 2017) . Notably, Fob1 oligomerization has been documented to bring rDNA spacer regions together in a process called Bchromosome kissing,^which may increase recombination events (Choudhury et al. 2015; Labib and Hodgson 2007) . Surprisingly, an integral protein of the RNA-interference pathway, Dcr1, was shown to be essential for transcription termination at sites of rDNA replication stress in fission yeast, thereby actually preventing recombination events (Sinkkonen et al. 2010; Gadaleta and Noguchi 2017; Castel et al. 2014) . Most eukaryotic cells have evolved a gene amplification system that serves to maintain high rDNA repeat copy numbers and to compensate for any loss in repeats. When repetitive rDNA is reduced in yeast, replication in the rDNA is stalled at the replication fork blocking (RFB) site. Uncoupling of the stalled replication forks results into DSBs that enhance recombination and subsequent repeat expansion (Kobayashi et al. 1998; Akamatsu and Kobayashi 2015) . The histone deacetylase Sir2 negatively regulates the RFB and thereby limits excessive recombination in order to maintain a balanced number of rDNA repeats (Kobayashi et al. 2004; Gadaleta and Noguchi 2017) . In mammalian cells, an RFB downstream of the 47S pre-rRNA gene is imposed by the RNA Polymerase I (PolI) transcription terminator complex involving transcription termination factor 1 and the replisome protein TIMELESS (Akamatsu and Kobayashi 2015) . Regulation of protein-mediated RFBs therefore seems to be crucial in forcing rDNA repeat extensions (Beuzer et al. 2014) . Accordingly, it has been suggested that loss of rDNA repeats is a sign of previous events of replication stress (Salim et al. 2017) . The histone chaperone Asf1 is known to prevent rDNA repeat expansions in yeast (Houseley and Tollervey 2011) , but it remains unclear which counteracting mechanisms control the number of repeats in human cells. Loss of SMC5, BRCA1, and BRCA2 and a number of other genes important in maintaining genome integrity after DNA damage result in rDNA repeat instability (Caburet et al. 2005; Warmerdam et al. 2016; Killen et al. 2009; Thompson and Schild 2002) . This implies that also in human cells, rDNA copy numbers are controlled through DNA replication and recombination-associated mechanisms. Maintaining a stable number of repeats is however not the only way in which cells can adjust the appropriate production of rRNA and thereby maintain proficient ribosome synthesis to support translation capacity. Transcription of the rDNA can also be increased by epigenetically reactivating silenced repeats or through increased PolI activity as discussed in the following paragraph.", "citance": "The histone chaperone Asf1 is known to prevent rDNA repeat expansions in yeast (Houseley and Tollervey 2011) , but it remains unclear which counteracting mechanisms control the number of repeats in human cells.", "claims": [{"text": "Asf1 encourages rDNA repeat expansions in yeast.", "subject": "Asf1", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Asf1 prevents rDNA repeat expansions in yeast.", "subject": "Asf1", "is_negation": false}]}

In this paper, we report that STIM1- and Orai1-mediated Ca(2+) oscillations promote melanoma invasion by orchestrating invadopodium assembly and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. Ca(2+) oscillation signals facilitate invadopodial precursor assembly by activating Src. Disruption of Ca(2+) oscillations inhibited invadopodium assembly. Furthermore, STIM1 and Orai1 regulate the proteolysis activity of individual invadopodia. Mechanistically, Orai1 blockade inhibited the recycling of MT1-matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) to the plasma membrane and entrapped MT1-MMP in the endocytic compartment to inhibit ECM degradation. STIM1 knockdown significantly inhibited melanoma lung metastasis in a xenograft mouse model, implicating the importance of this pathway in metastatic dissemination.

This feature is exploited by malignant cells to promote invasion and metastasis during cancer progression (Sabeh et al., 2009; Murphy and Courtneidge, 2011) . Invadopodia are actin-rich membrane protrusions mediating focal ECM degradation in malignant cancer cells (Linder, 2007; Wolf et al., 2007; Murphy and Courtneidge, 2011) . The assembly of invadopodia is initiated in response to the focal generation of phosphatidylinositol-3,4-biphosphate and the activation of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src, which recruits adaptor protein TKS5 and cortactin to initiate assembly of the actin core of invadopodium (Seals et al., 2005; Artym et al., 2006; Oikawa et al., 2008; Oser et al., 2009; Yamaguchi and Oikawa, 2010) . Upon maturation, invadopodia recruit and secrete proteinases such as membrane type 1 (MT1)-matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), MMP2, and MMP9 to degrade ECM and facilitate invasion (Artym et al., 2006; Clark et al., 2007; Clark and Weaver, 2008; Oser et al., 2009) .

{"s2orc_id": 768981, "title": "Health risk appraisal in older people 6: factors associated with self-reported poor vision and uptake of eye tests in older people", "abstract": "BACKGROUND Although free eye testing is available in the UK from a nation-wide network of optometrists, there is evidence of unrecognised, tractable vision loss amongst older people. A recent review identified this unmet need as a priority for further investigation, highlighting the need to understand public perceptions of eye services and barriers to service access and utilisation. This paper aims to identify risk factors for (1) having poor vision and (2) not having had an eyesight check among community-dwelling older people without an established ophthalmological diagnosis.   METHODS Secondary analysis of self-reported data from the ProAge trial. 1792 people without a known ophthalmological diagnosis were recruited from three group practices in London.   RESULTS Almost two in ten people in this population of older individuals without known ophthalmological diagnoses had self-reported vision loss, and more than a third of them had not had an eye test in the previous twelve months. In this sample, those with limited education, depressed mood, need for help with instrumental and basic activities of daily living (IADLs and BADLs), and subjective memory complaints were at increased risk of fair or poor self-reported vision. Individuals with basic education only were at increased risk for not having had an eye test in the previous 12 months (OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.17-1.98 p=0.002), as were those with no, or only one chronic condition (OR 1.850, 95% CI 1.382-2.477, p<0.001).   CONCLUSIONS Self-reported poor vision in older people without ophthalmological diagnoses is associated with other functional losses, with no or only one chronic condition, and with depression. This pattern of disorders may be the basis for case finding in general practice. Low educational attainment is an independent determinant of not having had eye tests, as well as a factor associated with undiagnosed vision loss. There are other factors, not identified in this study, which determine uptake of eye testing in those with self-reported vision loss. Further exploration is needed to identify these factors and lead towards effective case finding.", "citation_paragraph": "There is compelling evidence of unmet need for eye care amongst older people with undetected vision loss [1] . By the age of 65, 1 in 6 will become blind or partially sighted, and every day around 100 people in the UK start to lose their sight [2] . Between 12 and 50% of older people have undetected visual loss, with higher prevalence amongst women and risk increasing rapidly with age. As the population ages the prevalence of vision loss from a range of eye disorders linked to ageing processes is likely to increase greatly [3] .A substantial proportion of this visual impairment is due to remedial causes such as refractive errors and cataracts. In the Medical Research Council's study of screening older people refractive errors accounted for 32% of visual impairment in a 75 and over population. Causes of visual loss and eye disease in the rest of the visually impaired sample were: age related macular degeneration (AMD) (53%), cataract (36%), glaucoma (12%), myopic degeneration (4%) and diabetic eye disease (3%) [4] . A north London study of 1547 people aged 65 and over found that 30% were visually impaired and that 72 % of this impairment could potentially be improved by surgery or spectacles [5] .The negative impact of visual impairment on quality of life, activities of daily living [6] and accidents, including falls [7] , is also well documented, adding further weight to argument for focusing on prevention, early detection and timely access to treatment in this age group. The UK Vision Strategy [8] , launched in April 2008, aims to improve the eye health of the nation by eliminating avoidable sight loss, supporting those with a visual impairment and enhancing the inclusion, participation and independence of blind and partially sighted people.Whilst these aims are clearly desirable, methods of identifying those with unrecognised visual loss and encouraging them to take up services that will potentially improve their eyesight and quality of life are not well understood. The most recent update of the Cochrane review on screening for asymptomatic visual impairment shows that screening does not lead to improved vision in the older population [9] .It is not yet clear why remediable poor vision is being missed in an advanced primary care system with easily accessible doctors and nurses who can administer simple screening tests, and a widespread network of community optometrists who offer free NHS sight tests to older people. A review of the prevalence of visual impairment by the Royal National Institute for the Blind identified this problem as a priority for further investigation, highlighting issues of public perception and barriers to service access and utilisation [10] . Given the lack of evidence of benefit for population screening, an alternative approach might be to foster case-finding in general practice, targeting vision assessments at individuals at highest risk of having undetected vision loss.However, we do not know enough about the characteristics of people with un-assessed or untreated vision loss to be able to describe a clinically obvious group for targeted assessment. Although associations have been demonstrated between visual loss and age, wellbeing, functional ability, social networks and economic position in a descriptive study using data from the English longitudinal study on Ageing (ELSA) data [11] , no adjustments were made in this study for confounding relationships and factors. Similarly, analysis of data from the Medical Research Council's study of screening older people [12] which did make some adjustments for co-morbidities and functional ability is still insufficient to describe those with significant visual impairment in adequate detail.This study is the sixth in a series on health risk appraisal in older people. Its objectives are to describe the characteristics of community dwelling people aged 65 and over who report poor vision but who have no established ophthalmological diagnosis, and to investigate the relative importance of socio-economic status, educational attainment, social relationships, co-morbidities, depressed mood, cognitive impairment and functional ability on self-reported poor vision and uptake of eye testing.", "citance": "The most recent update of the Cochrane review on screening for asymptomatic visual impairment shows that screening does not lead to improved vision in the older population [9] .It is not yet clear why remediable poor vision is being missed in an advanced primary care system with easily accessible doctors and nurses who can administer simple screening tests, and a widespread network of community optometrists who offer free NHS sight tests to older people.", "claims": [{"text": "Asymptomatic visual impairment screening in elderly populations does not lead to improved vision.", "subject": "Asymptomatic visual impairment screening", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Asymptomatic visual impairment screening in elderly populations leads to improved vision.", "subject": "Asymptomatic visual impairment screening", "is_negation": true}]}

In recent years, mounting evidence has revealed important functions of Wnt signalling in diverse aspects of neural development, including neuronal polarization, guidance and branching of the axon and dendrites, as well as synapse formation and its structural remodelling. In contrast to Wnt signalling in cell proliferation and differentiation, which mostly acts through \u03b2-catenin-dependent pathways, Wnts engage a diverse array of non-transcriptional cascades in neuronal development, such as the planar cell polarity, cytoskeletal or calcium signalling pathways. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the mechanisms of Wnt signalling in the development of axon, dendrite and synapse formation.", "citation_paragraph": "Similar to the axon, dendrite outgrowth and guidance are instructed by extrinsic signals. One example is the apical dendrite of the pyramidal neuron in the mammalian cortex, which is guided towards the pial surface by a gradient of attractive semaphorin 3A (Sema3A), a protein that repels axons [70] . Wnts have been implicated in activity-stimulated dendritic arborization [71] . In cultured rat hippocampal neurons, potassium-induced depolarization increases dendritic arborization that requires b-catenin and neuronal secretion of Wnts [71] . Interestingly, in this paradigm, b-catenin functions independently of the TCF transcription factor. Depolarization leads to the transcription of Wnt2 through calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase I (CaMKI), CaMK kinase (CaMKK) and cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) [72] ( figure 3a) . In rat hippocampus, Wnt2 expression increases in the early postnatal period when the afferent projection is established in the dentate gyrus and CA1-3 regions [72] . Wnt7b stimulates dendrite development in dissociated mouse hippocampal neurons through Dvl1/ Dishevelled, the Rac small GTPase and JNK, linking Wnt signals to the actin cytoskeleton, as Rac is a well-known actin regulator [73] ( figure 3a) . The aforementioned studies of Wnt signalling in mammalian dendrite morphogenesis were mostly conducted using dissociated neuronal cultures or brain slices. A recent study on human patients of Williams syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder with hypersociability and mixed linguistic deficits, identified a mutation in the frizzled9 (FZD9) gene as causative for the clinical disease [74] . Unexpectedly, neurons generated from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) show longer total dendrite length and increased numbers of dendritic spines or synapses, which is confirmed in the analysis of a postmortem brain specimen [74] . Similarly, loss of the Ryk receptor results in excessive dendritic growth and branching in mouse hippocampal and cortical neurons [75] . Inhibitory effects of Ryk on dendrite growth are independent of its C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, suggesting that it may function independently of Dishevelleds or Vangl2 that bind this region [75] .An in vivo role for Wnts in dendrite outgrowth is revealed by observations made in C. elegans. Here, the projection of the dendrite of the C. elegans oxygen-sensing PQR neuron in the tail is instructed by attractive LIN-44/Wnt and EGL-20/Wnt signals that act through the LIN-17 and MIG-1 Frizzled receptors, respectively [76] (figure 3b). As is discussed in the section of Neuronal Polarity, defective dendrite guidance, rather than a reversal of neuronal polarization, has been proposed to explain the posteriorly directed mechanosensory dendrites in the C. elegans Wnt or Frizzled mutants [22] . In zebrafish, tiling of left and right trigeminal ganglionic axons along the dorsal midline of the head depends on mutual repulsion between axons, and ablation of unilateral trigeminal ganglion results in the invasion of contralateral trigeminal ganglionic axons [77] . In adult Drosophila, the v'ada sensory neurons from the left and right sides of the body tile their sensory territories along the ventral midline with the nonoverlapping distribution of their dendrites [78] (figure 3c). Interestingly, dendritic tiling of v'ada neurons does not depend on inter-neuronal repulsion; rather, repulsive Wnt5 signals from the ventral-most epidermal tissues keep dendrites away from the ventral midline [78] (figure 3c). Wnt5 acts through Ryk and Trio, a Rho GTPase exchange factor that has a well-established role in axon development [79, 80] .

What neural mechanisms allow humans to understand the vast diversity of languages and to distinguish linguistic signal from noise? One mechanism that has been implicated in language comprehension is neural entrainment to the volume envelope of speech. The volume envelope of speech fluctuates at low frequencies (< 8 Hz), decreasing at boundaries between syllables, words, and phrases. When people listen to speech, neural oscillations in the delta (1-4 Hz) and theta (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) bands become entrained to these fluctuations in volume (1) (2) (3) (4) .Entrainment to the volume envelope may represent an active neural mechanism to boost perceptual sensitivity to rhythmic stimuli (2, (5) (6) (7) . Although entrainment is partly driven by bottom-up features of the stimulus (8) (9) (10) , it also depends on top-down signals to auditory cortex from other brain areas. Auditory entrainment is strengthened when people see congruent visual and auditory information (11, 12) and is modulated by attention (13) and by top-down signals from frontal cortex (4, 14) .Cortical entrainment is proposed to perform a key role in speech comprehension, such as segmenting out syllables from a continuous speech stream (1, 2, 15) or optimizing perceptual sensitivity to rhythmic pulses of sound (5-7). However, the mechanisms driving entrainment to speech remain unclear. We consider two hypotheses. First, flexible entrainment to quasiperiodic rhythms may be specific to auditory perception (6); in visual perception, by contrast, cortical oscillations in the alpha band (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) Hz) may phase-lock only to consistent stimulus rhythms, without adjusting to variable stimulus rhythms (16) . Second, lowfrequency cortical entrainment may be a general-purpose neural mechanism that helps optimize perception to time-varying stimuli regardless of the perceptual modality. Neural oscillations may allow the brain to rhythmically orient attention to quasiperiodic stimuli (5, 17) across sensory systems.Because previous studies of cortical entrainment to rhythms in language have focused on oral speech, they have been unable to distinguish between these competing hypotheses. Here, we test for low-frequency entrainment to a purely visual language: American Sign Language (ASL). Prior studies have shown that neural and behavioral oscillations in vision are preferentially entrained by stimuli that flicker in the alpha band (18) (19) (20) (21) . Therefore, if flexible cortical entrainment to oral speech depends on modality-specific properties of auditory processing, then phase-locking to sign language should be concentrated in the alpha band, if it occurs at all (16) . Alternatively, if cortical entrainment is a generalized neural strategy to maximize sensitivity to rhythmic stimuli, then oscillatory activity in visual cortex should entrain at the frequency of informational changes in ASL.To determine whether human cerebral cortex entrains to rhythmic information in sign language, first we developed a metric for quantifying the amplitude of visual change in sign, by analogy to the acoustic envelope of speech. Next, we characterized visual variability across four sign languages, showing that this variability is quasiperiodic at <8 Hz. Finally, we demonstrated that cerebral cortex entrains to visual variability in sign language and showed that entrainment is strongest around the frequencies of phrases and individual signs in ASL.", "citance": "Auditory entrainment is strengthened when people see congruent visual and auditory information (11, 12) and is modulated by attention (13) and by top-down signals from frontal cortex (4, 14) .Cortical entrainment is proposed to perform a key role in speech comprehension, such as segmenting out syllables from a continuous speech stream (1, 2, 15) or optimizing perceptual sensitivity to rhythmic pulses of sound (5-7).", "claims": [{"text": "Auditory entrainment is strengthened when people see congruent visual and auditory information.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 27141777, "title": "Pleural involvement in lung cancer.", "abstract": "The pleural space, a sterile secluded environment in the thoracic cavity, represents an attractive metastatic site for various cancers of lung, breast and gastrointestinal origins. Whereas lung and breast adenocarcinomas could invade the pleural space because of their anatomic proximity, \"distant\" cancers like ovarian or gastrointestinal tract adenocarcinomas may employ more active mechanisms to the same end. A pleural metastasis is often accompanied by a malignant pleural effusion (MPE), an unfavorable complication that severely restricts the quality of life and expectancy of the cancer patient. MPE is the net \"product\" of three different processes, namely inflammation, enhanced angiogenesis and vascular leakage. Current efforts are focusing on the identification of cancer cell autocrine (specific mutation spectra and biochemical pathways) and paracrine (cytokine and chemokine signals) characteristics as well as host features (immunological or other) that underlie the MPE phenotype. Herein we examine the pleural histology, cytology and molecular characteristics that make the pleural cavity an attractive metastasis destination for lung adenocarcinoma. Mesothelial and tumor features that may account for the tumor's ability to invade the pleural space are highlighted. Finally, possible therapeutic interventions specifically targeting MPE are discussed.", "citation_paragraph": "Pleural membranes, due to their anatomic site and their visceral versus parietal topology, may present specific gene expressions, different paracrine signals, differential permeability, elasticity and tissue plasticity. All of these characteristics may positively impact cancer cell dissemination in the pleural space. Despite the general appreciation of the pleural role in lung and breast cancer dissemination, very little is known about the molecular characteristics, paracrine signaling and other properties of the pleural membranes that may attract cancer cells to the pleural space. Which mesothelial attribute(s) could render the pleural space a desired metastatic destination? Tissue specific metastasis is thought to be mediated by active mechanisms based on tumor \"homing\" to the target organ by ligand-receptor interactions. Such a mechanism should involve complementary molecules, featured on tumor and the target organ cells. For example, tumor cells expressing a specific cytokine receptor are \"sensing\" its cytokine ligand that is expressed by cells in a distant organ. The tumor cells upon breaching the endothelial barrier and entering the bloodstream disseminate to this distant site. This type of mechanism is used predominantly by the immune system where inflammatory or immune surveillance cells populate distant sites upon inflammation or organ surveillance. A notorious example is based on the interaction of CXCL12 chemokine (previously known as stromal cell derived factor-1, SCDF1) and the G-coupled receptor CXCR4. This interaction has important ramifications for physiologic embryogenesis and tumor invasion. CXCR4 is commonly expressed by virtually all mammalian cell types ranging from hematopoetic, endothelial and neuronal origin. Furthermore, CXCR4 is overexpressed in more than 23 human cancers. CXCR4-expressing cells respond to CXCL12 gradients in target organs during embryonic hematopoiesis, and additionally cancer cells-via the same mechanism-escape primary tumors and home to organs that release CXCL12 (49) . In NSCLC, disease prognosis correlates with localization of CXCR4 to the nuclear and/or the cytoplasmic membrane compartment. Higher CXCR4 expression in the cytoplasmic membrane correlates with a higher tendency to locally invade neighboring tissues and with increased propensity of tumor cells to form distant metastases (49) .Another pathway that could account for pleural metastasis is the lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) pathway. LPA controls motility, migration, cancer adhesion invasion as well as differentiation of many cell types (50) . LPA biosynthesis is controlled by autotaxin (ATX), a secreted lysophospholipase converting lysophosphatidylcholine to LPA. ATX is a molecule highly expressed in the omentum, a visceral membrane of mesothelial origin (like the pleural membranes), which is a frequent metastasis target for gastrointestinal invasive adenocarcinomas that subsequently produce ascites (51), a terminal disease hallmark resembling MPE. Interestingly, pleural membrane-originated MPM overtly express ATX, whereas bone marrow platelet-derived ATX, through binding to integrin alpha V/beta3 expressed by breast cancer cells, drives metastasis to the bone marrow (52) . Furthermore, integrin B3 was shown to be important for EGFR acquired resistance and its upregulated expression increases cell \"stemness\". Upon treatment with TKIs, cells expressing integrin B3 are enriched in the tumor cellular population. These cells (comprising the alleged cancer stem cells) acquire resistance to TKIs whereby integrin B3-Galectin engages the alternative KRAS-RalB signaling complex downstream of EGFR (17) . Under the light that integrin B3 is upregulated in EGFR positive lung cancer cell lines because of TKI therapy, and that KRAS and RalB are enriched in MPE-associated exosomes, it will be interesting to examine ATX's role in pleural metastasis.", "citance": "These cells (comprising the alleged cancer stem cells) acquire resistance to TKIs whereby integrin B3-Galectin engages the alternative KRAS-RalB signaling complex downstream of EGFR (17) .", "claims": [{"text": "B3-Galectin decreases cell resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) by engaging the alternate KRAS-RalB signaling complex downstream of EGFR.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "B3-Galectin increases cell resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) by engaging the alternate KRAS-RalB signaling complex downstream of EGFR.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 16068365, "title": null, "abstract": null, "citation_paragraph": "Extensive studies have shown that miRNAs exert their functions in cancer progression through targeting the mTORC1/2 signaling pathway (Uesugi et al., 2011; AlQurashi et al., 2013; Jin et al., 2013) . However, limited information is available on whether miRNAs play a role in the control of cell growth, proliferation, and survival by mTORC1/2 in response to growth factors, energy, stress, and nutrients. Rapamycin has been shown to up-regulate or down-regulate specific miRNAs, which play critical roles in muscle cell differentiation during skeletal myogenesis or rapamycin resistance in cancer therapy (Sun et al., 2010; Trindade et al., 2013) . To date, the miRNAs specifically regulated by mTORC2 remain to be identified. Our experiments revealed eight miRNAs that were specifically modulated by mTORC2, but not mTORC1, including miR-9-3p. Moreover, mTORC2 promoted cell survival via inhibition of miR-9-3p and up-regulation of E2F1 in a PP2A-c-Myc-dependent manner. Our results collectively suggest that mTORC2 inhibition or depletion stimulates the expression of miR-9-3p, which directly targets E2F1 to promote genotoxic drug-induced apoptosis, thus revealing a novel mechanism for cell survival control by mTORC2-regulated miRNAs. Differential regulation of miRNAs by mTORC1 and mTORC2 may also explain why mTOR kinase inhibitors are more effective than rapalogs for cancer treatment. Rapamycin may up-regulate prosurvival miRNAs and down-regulate proapoptotic miRNAs, which contribute to rapamycin resistance in cancer therapy . Our findings provide evidence that targeting mTORC2 has promising therapeutic benefits for overcoming genotoxic drug resistance through induction of proapoptotic miR-9-3p. Further in vivo studies are required to clarify the specific roles and mechanisms of miR-9-3p in enhancing the chemotherapeutic effects of mTOR inhibitors and genotoxic drugs. As miR-9-3p and its nonstar counterpart miR-9-5p exert opposite functions (death vs. survival), despite being encoded by the same genes and spliced from the same precursor, it would be interesting to elucidate whether these two miRNAs are simultaneously activated and deactivated, or one activated and the other deactivated under certain conditions. Our experiments demonstrated that miR-9-3p is significantly up-regulated upon Rictor depletion, whereas expression of miR-9-5p is slightly suppressed (Fig. S2 B) , supporting the theory that these two companion miRNAs are orchestrated to fine-tune cell fate. mTORC1 has been shown to induce the degradation of Ago2 in T cells (Bronevetsky et al., 2013) , a pivotal factor exhibiting preference for miRNA \"star\" strand selection in Drosophila (Okamura et al., 2009) . Hence, the possibility that mTORC2 suppresses the expression of miR-9-3p, not only at the transcriptional but also the posttranscriptional level via modulating certain types of Argonautes, and thus alters strand selection preference toward miR-9-3p/5p cannot be excluded. Further studies are required to establish the relationship between both mTORCs and different types of Argonautes with the aim of clarifying the posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism of mTORC2 action on miR-9-3p.Although Akt is the only established substrate of mTORC2 known to promote cell survival (Oh and Jacinto, 2011) , recent studies have additionally reported that Akt down-regulates c-Myc and inhibits c-Myc-dependent apoptosis (Rohn et al., 1998; Gill et al., 2013; Yeh et al., 2013) . Consistently, our results showed that inhibition of Akt via ectopic expression of AKT-DN induces a moderate increase in c-Myc and miR-9-3p expression, indicating a possible role of Akt in preventing c-Myc-miR-9-3p activation. Nevertheless, reactivation of Akt failed to suppress c-Myc-pri-miR-9-2-miR-9-3p and corresponding apoptosis induced by mTORC2 inhibition, and silencing endogenous Akt did not further increase c-Mycpri-miR-9-2-miR-9-3p levels triggered by serum starvation and 5-FU treatment, suggesting that tumor cells initiate the c-Myc-pri-miR-9-2-miR-9-3p-E2F1 apoptotic pathway via a mechanism bypassing control of Akt under these conditions. Remarkably, Rictor depletion or PP242 treatment induced up-regulation of CIP2A and binding to PP2Ac to a more significant extent, reducing PP2A phosphatase activity toward c-Myc S62, leading to enhanced S62 phosphorylation of c-Myc, and consequent stabilization of c-Myc and transcription of miR-9-3p. Mechanistically, Rictor interacts with both CIP2A and PP2Ac. Notably, deletion of CIP2A or reactivation of PP2A reversed the induction of proapoptotic miR-9-3p upon mTORC2 inhibition, suggesting that these two proteins are novel targets of mTORC2 that play important roles in mTORC2-mediated survival. The mTORC2-CIP2A-PP2A cascade may represent a novel Akt-independent mechanism by which mTORC2 mediates c-Myc-pri-miR-9-2-miR-9-3p-E2F1 and promotes tumor cell survival. Although mTORC2 promotes tumor cell survival via both the CIP2A-PP2A-c-Myc-pri-miR-9-2-miR-9-3p-E2F1 cascade and Akt in the physiological state, loss of mTORC2 activity possibly reprograms the signaling network and renders tumor cells susceptible to the c-Myc-miR-9-3p apoptotic pathway, even when Akt activity is sufficiently high. The findings of this study are of particular interest in view of multiple lines of evidence showing that Akt activity is pivotal in primary drug resistance (Clark et al., 2002; Knuefermann et al., 2003; Pei et al., 2009 ) and acquired resistance conferred by chemotherapy (Huang and Hung, 2009 ) and provide novel mechanistic insights to facilitate effective combination therapy with agents targeting mTORC2 and genotoxic drugs for eliminating drug resistance.E2F1 has been identified as a key regulator of apoptosis. However, recent evidence indicates that activated E2F1 plays an unexpected prosurvival role and represents a mechanism for cancer drug resistance in association with tumor progression (Stanelle and P\u00fctzer, 2006; P\u00fctzer and Engelmann, 2013) . Although EGF receptor-Ras-Raf-MAPK, PI3-K-Akt, and NF-\u03baB pathways have been identified as targets of E2F1 for promoting cell survival (Ladu et al., 2008; Zheng et al., 2009) , the mechanism underlying survival signaling that antagonizes drug-induced cell death remains poorly defined and is possibly highly redundant. There is an urgent need to develop effective strategies for reducing E2F1 expression and activity to overcome drug resistance. As shown here, down-regulation of E2F1 and promotion of DNA damage-induced apoptosis via targeting mTORC2 provides a potential strategy to overcome E2F1-related drug resistance. Furthermore, regulation of E2F1 represents a previously unknown mechanism through which mTORC2 promotes cell survival and cancer progression.Using cellular and mouse genetic models, we demonstrated that mTORC2 negatively regulates miR-9-3p to enhance E2F1 expression and promote cell survival in a CIP2A-PP2A-c-Myc-dependent manner. c-Myc, initially documented for its role in promoting cell cycle progression, is now recognized as a double-edged sword in malignancy because it is the most robust agent encoded in our genome, both to promote proliferation and trigger cell death (McMahon, 2014) . Although normal cells with high-level ectopic expression of c-Myc often undergo apoptosis (Wyllie et al., 1987; Askew et al., 1991; Neiman et al., 1991) , tumor cells have acquired the ability to resist the death-inducing effects of elevated endogenous c-Myc. One of the most well-characterized mechanisms gained by tumor cells to antagonize the apoptotic effects of c-Myc through evolution is parallel BCL-2 activation (Letai et al., 2004; Ozdek et al., 2004) , which can blunt the c-Myc-initiated death pathway in a mitochondriadependent manner. The signaling events preventing c-Myc activation to exert apoptosis, but not otherwise initiating a compensatory pathway to counterbalance its death-inducing effect, have been elucidated to a limited extent so far. Our results clearly suggest that mTORC2 serves as a pivotal signaling intersection point switching the c-Myc-miR-9-3p apoptotic pathway on or off. With the present findings, our knowledge of mTORC2 as a key signaling rheostat in cell growth and survival has expanded further. Sophisticated control of the CIP2A-PP2A-c-Myc axis by mTORC2 may also aid in alleviating the controversy with regard to the c-Myc switch toward transformation/proliferation or apoptosis. When activity of mTORC2 is high, CIP2A-PP2A-c-Myc mainly functions to promote transformation/proliferation, and when activity is low, apoptosis may be triggered through induction of miR-9-3p and suppression of E2F1. From this point of view, simply deactivating the CIP2A-PP2A-c-Myc axis (such as using new inhibitory compounds directly targeting c-Myc) may not represent the most effective tumor treatment strategy, as this may cause unanticipated side effects by blocking the proapoptotic potential of c-Myc. Additionally, the best-characterized apoptotic effect of c-Myc is associated with p53 (Zindy et al., 1998) . However, p53 mutates and loses its function in about half of all human malignancies. Moreover, mutant p53 counterattacks to promote cancer cell survival (Engelmann and P\u00fctzer, 2012; P\u00fctzer and Engelmann, 2013) . Therefore, the currently discovered CIP2A-c-Myc-miR-9-3p-E2F1 pathway represents an alternative way to initiate apoptosis in these tumors with p53 mutations. Most importantly, in conjunction with our results from human cancer cell lines with WT p53 (MCF-7 and A549) or mutant p53 (MDA-MB-231, PC-3M, and HCT116), mouse xenografts, and a mouse genetic model, our current findings suggest that this pathway represents a general proapoptotic mechanism in tumors, even if p53 is mutated. Not surprisingly, as E2F1 is primarily responsible for trans-activation of mutant p53 (Engelmann and P\u00fctzer, 2012; P\u00fctzer and Engelmann, 2013; Muller and Vousden, 2014) , initiating this pathway will probably carry out its proapoptotic functions also by suppressing the transcription of mutant p53.Our results collectively highlight a novel mechanism for cell survival control by mTORC2 and further support the utility of targeted mTORC2 inhibition as a potential strategy, not only to recover the apoptotic potential of endogenous c-Myc-miR-9-3p but also to overcome E2F1-related drug resistance. It also provides a new rationale for simultaneously administrating miR-9-3p when issuing genotoxic drug treatment, which may help to eliminate or at least mitigate chemoresistance caused by E2F1 induction.", "citance": "One of the most well-characterized mechanisms gained by tumor cells to antagonize the apoptotic effects of c-Myc through evolution is parallel BCL-2 activation (Letai et al., 2004; Ozdek et al., 2004) , which can blunt the c-Myc-initiated death pathway in a mitochondriadependent manner.", "claims": [{"text": "BCL-2 activation antagonizes the apoptotic effects of c-Myc.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "BCL-2 promotes the apoptotic effects of c-Myc.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}
{"s2orc_id": 54447044, "title": "Molecular Mechanisms of Early and Late LTP", "abstract": "LTP is the most intensively studied cellular model of the memory and generally divided at least two distinct phases as early and late. E-LTP requires activation of CaMKII that initiates biochemical events and trafficking of proteins, which eventually potentiate synaptic transmission, and is independent of de novo protein synthesis. In contrast, L-LTP requires gene expression and local protein synthesis regulated via TrkB receptor- and functional prions CPEB2-3-mediated translation. Maintenance of LTP for longer periods depends on constitutively active PKM\u03b6. Throughout this review, current knowledge about early and late phases of LTP will be reviewed.", "citation_paragraph": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a small dimeric protein that acts through tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB), a receptor tyrosine kinase that it binds with high affinity. BDNF is found both in the presynaptic and postsynaptic regions in glutamatergic synapses [144, 145] and it is released in response to LTP inducing stimuli [146] however, the release zone have not been determined precisely. A recent study compared the contributions of presynaptic and postsynaptic BDNF and TrkB to LTP, by selectively deleting them in CA3 and CA1 [147] . Presynaptic BDNF is involved in LTP induction, when deleted causes stable but smaller LTP, whereas postsynaptic BDNF contributes to LTP maintenance, deletion of it leads to rapid decay of LTP [147] . Likewise, presynaptic TrkB receptor is involved in maintenance, and postsynaptic TrkB is required for LTP formation, deletion of TrkB in CA1 almost completely blocks LTP [147] . Other studies using glutamate uncaging has demonstrated the importance of postsynaptic release and autocrine signaling of BDNF [148, 149] .BDNF is an important regulator of synaptic plasticity and protein synthesis during LTP [150] . Although there are differences in the time periods during which the inhibitors are effective depending on the particular method of L-LTP induction, inhibition of protein synthesis or BDNF-TrkB signaling eliminates L-LTP with similar kinetics [148, 151, 152] . Therefore, the effects of BDNF are largely, but not exclusively, assigned to its ability to regulate translational machinery. TrkB receptors activate ERK/MNK1 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt-mTORC1 pathways [153] . However, it is shown that BDNF causes more pronounced upregulation of PI3K-Akt pathway than ERK [111, 154] . Thus, enhanced local translation through BDNF is thought to rely on mTORC1 activation [for reviews see 155,156] .A downstream target of ERK is calpain-2, a protease that cleave phosphatase PTEN, a negative regulator of Akt [157] . Thus, calpain-2 activation by ERK leads to enhanced local protein synthesis via Akt-mTORC1. Calpain also degrades a Ras inhibitor protein SCOP [158] . However, degradation of SCOP stimulates its rapid mTORC1-dependent synthesis [158] . This pathway therefore has a self-inhibiting effect [159] .Glycogen synthase kinase-3 \u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) is a serine/threonine kinase that regulates synaptic plasticity bidirectionally and a substrate for Akt and PP1 [160] . During LTP, GSK3\u03b2 is phosphorylated by Akt, decreasing its activity. In contrast, during LTD, GSK3\u03b2 activity is increased via dephosphorylation of GSK3\u03b2 by PP1 and inhibition of Akt [160] . It is also shown that inhibition of GSK3\u03b2 by PI3K-Akt prevents synapses from undergoing LTD, preserving synaptic modifications [160] .BDNF also affects local protein synthesis through miRNA regulation by elevating the expression of Dicer endonuclease, which cleaves pre-miRNAs to produce mature miRNAs and of the RNA-binding protein Lin28a, which prevents the target pre-miRNAs from being converted to mature miRNAs [161] . ERK-mediated phosphorylation of TRBP, a binding partner of Dicer and Lin28a, increase stabilization of Dicer and Lin28a by forming a complex with them [162] . Thus, with this dual regulation, while BDNF generally promotes miRNA formation, it selectively prevents the formation of target miRNAs via Lin28a, upregulating proteins required for synaptic plasticity such as GluR1, CaMKII\u03b1, Homer2 [161] . This mechanism confers selectivity to the translational effects of BDNF [161] .The importance of BDNF is further expanded by the pieces of evidence showing BDNF is a PRP and hence TrkB is a tag. BDNF is upregulated during L-LTP [111] . BDNF heterozygous mice show impaired STC and BDNF application can transform E-LTP into L-LTP [163, 164] . When L-LTP is induced in one synapse (S1), a weak tetanus on another synapse (S2), normally expected to induce E-LTP, can elicit L-LTP by capturing PRPs. Inhibition of TrkB receptors prevents capture and formation of L-LTP on S2 [152] . Interestingly, at the time of L-LTP induction, inhibition of TrkB on S1 blocks L-LTP on S1, without affecting capture on S2 [152] . This is because L-LTP inducing stimuli not only create a tag on that synapse, but also produces PRPs [152] . Thus, these results strongly indicate that BDNF is a PRP and TrkB is a tag.", "citance": "Thus, with this dual regulation, while BDNF generally promotes miRNA formation, it selectively prevents the formation of target miRNAs via Lin28a, upregulating proteins required for synaptic plasticity such as GluR1, CaMKII\u03b1, Homer2 [161] .", "claims": [{"text": "BDNF upregulates proteins required for synaptic plasticity by selectively preventing the formation of target microRNAs via Lin28a.

We provide evidence that BLM and FANCD2 colocalise and co-immunoprecipitate following treatment with either DNA crosslinkers or agents inducing replication arrest. We also find that the FA core complex is necessary for BLM phosphorylation and assembly in nuclear foci in response to crosslinked DNA. Moreover, we show that knock-down of the MRE11 complex, whose function is also under the control of the FA core complex, enhances cellular and chromosomal sensitivity to DNA interstrand crosslinks in BS cells. These findings suggest the existence of a functional link between BLM and the FA pathway and that BLM and the MRE11 complex are in two separated branches of a pathway resulting in S-phase checkpoint activation, chromosome integrity and cell survival in response to crosslinked DNA.", "citation_paragraph": "Fanconi anaemia (FA) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic condition associated with bone marrow failure, reduced fertility and predisposition to cancer, essentially myeloid leukaemia (Garcia-Higuera et al, 1999a; Ahmad et al, 2002) . At the cellular level, FA is characterised by chromosome instability, hypersensitivity and altered mutability to agents inducing DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) ). Eight FANC genes (A, C, D1/BRCA2, D2, E, F, G/XRCC9 and L) have been cloned so far Rosselli et al, 2003) and their products are thought to define a pathway involved in the control of genomic stability and checkpoint activation, the FA pathway (Garcia-Higuera et al, 1999a; D'Andrea and Grompe, 2003; Rosselli et al, 2003) . Furthermore, six of the FANC proteins (A, C, E, F, G and L) form a nuclear complex (FA core complex) in response to DNA damage, and mutation in any of its component leads to inactivation of the complex (GarciaHiguera et al, 1999b; Waisfisz et al, 1999; Medhurst et al, 2001 ) and loss of activation of the FA downstream effector FANCD2 .Bloom syndrome (BS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterised by reduced fertility, immunodeficiency and elevated predisposition to different types of cancer, including leukaemia (van Brabant et al, 2000) . At the cellular level, BS is associated with chromosome instability, hypersensitivity to genotoxic agents and hypermutability . The gene mutated in BS, BLM, encodes for a RecQ-class DNA helicase (Ellis et al, 1995) . The cellular role of BLM is poorly defined, but a growing body of evidence indicates that it could be required for the maintenance of genome stability during DNA replication .Several observations suggest a functional interaction between BLM and the FA pathway. First, BS and FA patients share a partial overlapping phenotype. Second, BS and FA cells show a similar type of chromosomal instability, that is, chromosome interchanges and mainly quadriradial forms (van Brabant et al, 2000; Grompe and D'Andrea, 2001) . Third, BLM is part of a supermolecular complex in which the key component is BRCA1, a functional partner of FANCD2 (Wang et al, 2000; Garcia-Higuera et al, 2001 ) and an interactor of FANCA (Folias et al, 2002) . Fourth, both BLM and the FA core complex are necessary for the assembly of the MRE11 complex, another protein complex involved in genome stability, although in response to different genotoxic stresses (Franchitto and Pichierri, 2002a; Pichierri et al, 2002) .

The drawbacks of inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFs) currently used for the treatment of AMD, which include resistance and potential serious side-effects, require the identification of new therapeutic targets to modulate angiogenesis. BMP9 signaling through the endothelial Alk1 serine-threonine kinase receptor modulates the response of endothelial cells to VEGF and promotes vessel quiescence and maturation during development. Here, we show that BMP9/Alk1 signaling inhibits neovessel formation in mouse models of pathological ocular angiogenesis relevant to AMD. Activating Alk1 signaling in laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) inhibited neovascularization and reduced the volume of vascular lesions. Alk1 signaling was also found to interfere with VEGF signaling in endothelial cells whereas BMP9 potentiated the inhibitory effects of VEGFR2 signaling blockade, both in OIR and laser-induced CNV. Together, our data show that targeting BMP9/Alk1 efficiently prevents the growth of neovessels in AMD models and introduce a new approach to improve conventional anti-VEGF therapies.", "citation_paragraph": "Current therapies to treat ophthalmic diseases are mostly centered on the inhibition of a single factor, VEGF. The outcomes of anti-VEGF treatments are to counteract pathological neovascularization and disease progression, to arrest visual impairment and, in the best case, to gain the recovery of vision. Some molecules targeting VEGF are currently used in ophthalmology, and many more are under investigation in clinical trials for either AMD, ROP, or other eye diseases characterized by neovascularization. While VEGF blocking agents have provided good clinical benefits, a number of patients show poor responses to these drugs and some concerns have been raised regarding the long term use of VEGF inhibitors [33] . It has been proposed that pan-VEGF blockade is associated with increased risks of geographic atrophy, a gradual complication characterized, among others, by choriocapillaries and RPE atrophy, photoreceptors death, and leading to a progressive visual loss [35] , [34] . It is therefore of great clinical interest to identify novel targets that could complement or replace current treatments. Numerous signaling pathways have been shown to modulate VEGF activity, and therefore could be targeted to improve the therapeutic benefits of current anti-angiogenic therapies. Among those, signaling components of the Notch, Wnt and Ephrin/Eph families have been found to be differentially regulated in pathological vessels and could represent new targets to prevent neovascularization in ocular diseases [36] , [37] , [38] , [39] .In this study, we have examined the involvement of the BMP receptor Alk1 in pathological models of ocular neovascularization, in the backdrop of its established role in physiological angiogenesis in the developing retina [19] . We found that Alk1 was up-regulated in the endothelium of mice undergoing pathological angiogenesis, which may act in feedback fashion as a ''brake'' or negative regulator to restrain VEGF-induced angiogenesis. As such, inhibition of Alk1 signaling through the use of Alk1Fc or genetic deletion of Alk1 significantly increased neovascularization and vascular tuft formation. However, the activation of Alk1 in pathological vessels is likely suboptimal, as we show that exogenous BMP9 can reduce pathological angiogenesis in OIR and CNV lesions.The mechanisms that drive pathological neovascularization, which is characterized by the formation of vascular tufts growing towards the vitreous, are distinct from those driving healthy revascularization of the avascular region of OIR retinas [40] . The tuft formation is often referred to as 'pathological angiogenesis', while the closure of the avascular area as revascularization. While efficient revascularisation reduces hypoxia and is desired to prevent tissue damage, neovascular tufts are characterized by newly forming vascular sprouts that fail to regenerate the capillary network and instead grow towards the vitreous. It is intriguing that the two processes are usually inversely correlated; when healthy vascular regeneration is increased, neovascular tufts are reduced [40] . However, the mechanisms underlying this effect are not entirely clear. Our data show that modulation of Alk1 signaling does not appear to affect the avascular area of OIR retinas (revascularization), but is highly efficient at reducing the appearance of vascular tufts (pathological neovascularization), suggesting that Alk1 agonists would prevent pathological neovascularization without adversely affecting normal revascularization. The effect of BMP9 on vascular tuft formation may reflect its ability to modulate VEGF signaling, which is the main driver of tuft formation.During retinal angiogenesis, Alk1 signaling maintains homeostasis by offering a counterbalance to proangiogenic pathways, such as the one mediated by VEGF, by contributing to the specification of ECs into stalk and tip cells and the proper remodeling of the vasculature [19] , [41] . Consistent with this notion, BMP9 decreased VEGFR2 expression and increased VEGFR1 expression in ECs, likely altering the sensitivity of VEGF-VEGFR2 signaling. These changes, combined with the effects of Alk1 signaling on the expression of endothelial tip and stalk cell markers, likely contribute to the reduction of pathological angiogenesis caused by BMP9.Recently, numerous classes of Alk1 inhibitors have been developed for the prevention of tumor angiogenesis [42] , [43] . These inhibitors have been shown to prevent tumor angiogenesis, and can increase the anti-angiogenic effects of VEGF inhibitors. These results may at first Figure 6 : effects of bMP9 and VeGFr2 blockade on cnV. A.

Scale bar: 75 \u03bcm. seem to contradict ours, which didn't show inhibition of retinal and choroidal angiogenesis with Alk1Fc. Some discrepancies in Alk1 signaling in tumor angiogenesis may be explained in part by cell context, dose, and timing, as well as Alk1 cross-talk with other signaling pathways, the micro-tumor environment, and the stage of cancer at the time of treatment. In line with this supposition, tumor vessels are known to behave aberrantly and are notably more tortuous and leaky than vessels from tissues such as the retina.We did however observe that combination of Alk1Fc with DC101 abrogated pathological neovessel formation in OIR induced by Alk1 inhibition. These data provide evidence that Alk1 modulates angiogenesis at least in part through modulation of VEGF signaling. This is line with a study showing that treatment with bevacizumab, an antibody that binds and neutralises human VEGF, decreases the number of dysplastic vessels in the brain of mice deficient for Alk1 [44] . In addition, we also show that BMP9/Alk1 signaling results in changes in VEGFR1 expression in ECs. This suggest that in blood vessels stimulated with BMP9, higher VEGFR1 levels may contribute to decreased VEGF signaling through the negative regulation of VEGF bioavailability [45] . These data, along with studies showing that BMP/Smad signaling modulates Notch activity in ECs [19] [ 30] , demonstrate that Alk1 is an important regulator of the response of ECs to angiogenic signals, and that modulators of Alk1 signaling may affect the response of blood vessels to VEGF. Modulation of Alk1 activity may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to possibly overcome resistance to VEGF antagonists in diseases such as AMD.The data we present here suggest that Alk1-based agonists could also be of interest for the treatment of a variety of ischemic retinopathies including ROP and diabetic retinopathy. Arguably, BMP9/Alk1 signaling targets may be implicated as positive effectors of the desired quiescence of EC and eventual mediators of lateral side-effects on non-vascular retina cells. Thus, future studies on targets of Alk1 signaling might be needed to limit this possibility. Finally, a study showing that BMP9 promotes stabilization of endothelial junctions suggests that Alk1 agonists could prevent the loss of retinal blood barrier function and permeability [46] associated with ROP and diabetic retinopathies, and thus could help prevent serious complications of vascular leakage such as macular edema.Overall, results from the current study reveal BMP9 as an effective and potent inhibitor of pathological neovascularization associated with wet AMD. Moreover, BMP9 agonists represent promising complements that would lower the conventional dose of anti-VEGF agents required to achieve an equivalent therapeutic index. Thus, BMP9 and anti-VEGF combined therapies would limit the aforementioned adverse effects commonly associated with VEGF inhibitors.", "citance": "Finally, a study showing that BMP9 promotes stabilization of endothelial junctions suggests that Alk1 agonists could prevent the loss of retinal blood barrier function and permeability [46] associated with ROP and diabetic retinopathies, and thus could help prevent serious complications of vascular leakage such as macular edema.", "claims": [{"text": "BMP9 promotes destabilization of endothelial junctions.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "BMP9 promotes stabilization of endothelial junctions.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Symmetry imposition, however, results in the loss of asymmetric features of the virus. Here, we provide a brief overview of the methods used to investigate non-symmetric capsid features. These include the recently developed focussed classification as well as more conventional methods which simply do not impose any symmetry. Asymmetric single-particle image analysis can reveal novel aspects of virus structure. For example, the VP4 capsid spike of rotavirus is only present at partial occupancy, the bacteriophage MS2 capsid contains a single copy of a maturation protein and some viruses also encode portals or portal-like assemblies for the packaging and/or release of their genome upon infection.

Therefore, most ribosomal proteins have to travel from the cytoplasm to their incorporation site on pre-ribosomes within the nucleus. However, due to their particular characteristics, such as a highly basic amino acid composition and the presence of unstructured extensions, ribosomal proteins are especially prone to aggregation and degradation in their unassembled state, hence specific mechanisms must operate to ensure their safe delivery. Recent studies have uncovered a group of proteins, termed dedicated chaperones, specialized in accompanying and guarding individual ribosomal proteins. In this essay, we review how these dedicated chaperones utilize different folds to interact with their ribosomal protein clients and how they ensure their soluble expression and interconnect their intracellular transport with their efficient assembly into pre-ribosomes.", "citation_paragraph": "In recent years, it has turned out that the general chaperone network and importins are not sufficient to protect r-proteins as obvious from the fact that at least some r-proteins additionally have their own specific chaperones. So far, six such dedicated chaperones for yeast r-proteins have been characterized (Table 1) .Two of these dedicated chaperones, Yar1 and Tsr2, interact with r-proteins of the small ribosomal subunit. While Yar1 binds to newly synthesized Rps3 already in the cytoplasm, thereby protecting it from aggregation, and likely accompanies Rps3 to its assembly site in the nucleus [24, [41] [42] [43] [44] , Tsr2 associates with Rps26 after its nuclear import and presumably assists its transfer to pre-ribosomal particles [45, 46] . The other four dedicated chaperones, Sqt1, Rrb1, Acl4, and Syo1, interact with large subunit r-proteins. Sqt1 binds to Rpl10 (uL16) in the cytoplasm where it is involved in the loading of Rpl10 onto almost mature 60S subunits [24, 47, 48] . Rrb1 associates with Rpl3 in the cytoplasm and probably ensures its efficient incorporation into pre-ribosomal particles in the nucleus [24, 49, 50] . Acl4 interacts with Rpl4 and accompanies this r-protein from its synthesis in the cytoplasm until its assembly into pre-ribosomes in the nucleus [51, 52] . Finally, Syo1 is an import adaptor and chaperone, which is unique in that it binds not just one r-protein, but has the ability to accommodate two different r-proteins at the same time, Rpl5 (uL18) and Rpl11 (uL5) [53] [54] [55] .In addition to these yeast r-protein chaperones, a dedicated chaperone of human RPL23 (hRPL23; uL14) has recently been described, the BRCA2 and CDKN1A interacting protein BCCIP isoform b, which forms a trimeric complex together with hRPL23 and the 60S biogenesis factor eIF6 [56] .

{"s2orc_id": 29896522, "title": "Neuronal Oscillations, Coherence, and Consciousness", "abstract": "Evidence accumulated in the past two decades strongly suggests that synchronization of oscillatory neural signals is one of the key mechanisms for integrating and selecting information in distributed networks. Coherence of neural signals allows highly specific patterns of effective neuronal coupling to be set up, thus enabling flexible and context-dependent binding, the selection of relevant information and the efficient routing of signals through processing pathways. In this chapter, we discuss evidence from human and animal studies suggesting that dynamic interaction through coherent oscillations is likely to be involved in several processes indispensable for consciousness, including arousal, perceptual integration, attentional selection, and working memory. We argue that modulation of dynamic oscillatory coupling may relate to both changes in levels of consciousness, as well as changes in the contents of conscious states.", "citation_paragraph": "A relation of oscillatory activity to changes in the contents of conscious states is suggested by studies that have applied bistable or ambiguous perceptual conditions while recording oscillatory coupling across neural assemblies. Early evidence was obtained in experiments in which activity was recorded from the visual cortex of awake cats under conditions of binocular rivalry (Fries et al., , 2002 . Binocular rivalry is a particularly interesting case of dynamic response selection that occurs when the images in the two eyes are incongruent and cannot be fused into a coherent percept. In this case, only signals from one of the two eyes are selected and perceived at any given time, whereas those from the other eye are suppressed. In normal subjects, perception alternates between the stimuli presented to left and right eye, respectively. Obviously, this experimental situation is particularly suited for studying the basis of consciousness, because neuronal responses to a given stimulus can be studied either with or without an accompanying awareness (Crick and Koch, 1990; Engel et al., 1999) . Fries and colleagues (1997, 2002) tested the hypothesis that response selection in early visual areas might be achieved by modulation of oscillatory neuronal coupling. These measurements were performed in awake strabismic cats with electrodes chronically implanted in primary and secondary visual cortex. The animals were subjected to dichoptic visual stimulation, that is, patterns moving in different directions were simultaneously presented to the left and the right eye, respectively. Due to the strabismus, one eye was dominant, that is, that eye's stimulus was perceived when equal contrast stimuli were given to both eyes. The results obtained with this experimental approach showed that visual cortical neurons driven by the dominant and the suppressed eye, respectively, did not differ in the strength of their firing rate response to visual stimulation. They showed, however, profound differences with respect to their synchronization. Neurons supporting the dominant percept increased their synchrony, whereas cells processing the suppressed visual pattern decreased their coupling. This effect was observed specifically in the gamma-frequency band (Fries et al., , 2002 . These studies clearly suggest that changes in the contents of consciousness, as evident during binocular rivalry, are associated with fluctuations in neural coupling. Studies on bistable perception in monkey visual cortex also support these conclusions (Wilke et al., 2006) .In humans, studies using ambiguous stimulus settings also suggest a clear relation between intrinsic fluctuations of dynamic coupling and changes in the perceptual state. Doesburg and coworkers (2005) recorded EEG during binocular rivalry and reported that increases in gamma-band coupling preceded the subjects' perceptual switches. Using a dynamic apparent motion stimulus, Rose and B\u00fc chel (2005) showed that perceptual changes were associated with fluctuations of gamma-band coupling across the cerebral hemispheres. In a similar vein, fluctuations in beta-band coupling have been shown to predict the perceptual state in an ambiguous audio-visual paradigm (Figure 3 .2). Neuronal activity was reconstructed from the EEG of human subjects presented with two moving bars that could be perceived either as bouncing or passing (Figure 3.2A) . Long-range beta-band coherence between frontoparietal and visual cortex was observed during the processing of the ambiguous motion stimulus, which was enhanced for about 1 s around the time of bar overlap (Figure 3.2B) . Coherence was enhanced in a widespread cortical network including bilateral frontal eye fields, posterior parietal cortex and motion-sensitive visual areas (Figure 3.2C) . Importantly, the beta-band coherence within this network was found to predict whether the subjects perceived the bars as bouncing or passing (Figure 3.2D ). Taken together, these studies strongly suggest that intrinsically generated fluctuations in neural coupling during the processing of ambiguous stimuli are relevant for controlling changes in the subjects' conscious perceptual contents. Evidence for a relation between oscillations and conscious processing has also been obtained in studies using masking paradigms. In a study comparing the processing of visible and invisible word stimuli in a delayed match-to-sample task, stimulus visibility was found to be associated with enhanced long-range synchronization in the gamma-band (Melloni et al., 2007) . Combining a similar paradigm with intracranial recordings in epilepsy patients, another study has observed enhanced beta-band coherence for visible compared to invisible stimuli (Gaillard et al., 2009) . A recent MEG study has reported that conscious word-form perception correlates with alpha-band suppression in occipito-temporal cortex (Levy et al., 2013) .As stated above, we assume that conscious awareness requires a mechanism that selects relevant information and enhances its impact on subsequent processing stages. Evidently, attention is of particular importance for the selection of signals and top-down modulation of sensory processing. Therefore, investigation of attentional mechanisms seems highly relevant for understanding consciousness Dehaene et al., 2006) . Strong evidence for attentional modulation of neural synchrony is provided by experiments in behaving monkeys. One of the earliest studies (Steinmetz et al., 2000) investigated cross-modal attentional shifts in monkeys that had to direct attention to either visual or tactile stimuli that were presented simultaneously. Synchrony among neurons in somatosensory cortex depended strongly on the monkey's attention. If the monkey shifted attention to the visual task, temporal correlations typically decreased among somatosensory cells, as compared to task epochs during which attention was not distracted from the somatosensory stimuli.In the visual system of monkeys, attentional effects on oscillatory synchrony were first investigated by recordings from area V4 . In this study, two stimuli were presented simultaneously on a screen, one inside the receptive fields of the recorded neurons and the other nearby. The animals had to detect subtle changes in one or the other stimulus. If attention was shifted towards the stimulus processed by the recorded cells, there was a marked increase in local synchronization. This finding was confirmed by Taylor and coworkers (2005) using a demanding visual task that required monkeys to track changes in an object's shape over time. In both studies, the attentional effects were observed specifically in the gammafrequency band. A recent study has provided evidence that this attentional enhancement of synchrony in local populations in area V4 strongly involves the locking of putative inhibitory interneurons (Vinck et al., 2013) . Recent studies in monkeys have also demonstrated an attention-specific enhancement of long-range gammaband coupling between V4 and V1 (Figure 3. 3) (Bosman et al., 2012; Grothe et al., 2012) and between V4 and the frontal eye field (Gregoriou et al., 2009 (Gregoriou et al., , 2012 . These data clearly demonstrate that gammaband coupling is not only relevant for local processing, but also for long-range functional communication (Fries, 2005 (Fries, , 2009 . Buschman and Miller (2007) provided evidence that beta-band activity can also be associated with attentional selection. The authors trained monkeys to detect a target amongst a set of distractors in either a pop-out or a serial search regime. Analysis of coherence between frontal and parietal signals revealed that interactions occurred predominantly in the beta-band during search, that is, in the condition involving a strong endogenous top-down processing component. In contrast, coupling was more prominent in the gamma-band in the pop-out condition, where performance primarily depended on the saliency of the target stimulus. These data support the hypothesis that endogenously driven top-down attention may be associated with large-scale communication in lower frequency bands, whereas coupling may occur at higher frequencies when bottom-up signals need to be conveyed (Engel and Fries, 2010) .A relation between attention and modulation of synchronized oscillations is also well established for the human brain. Evidence from EEG and MEG studies shows that high-frequency oscillations are enhanced by attention in the human visual system (e.g., TallonBaudry et al., 2005; Kranczioch et al., 2006 Kranczioch et al., , 2007 Vidal et al., 2006; Engell and McCarthy, 2010; M\u00fc sch et al., 2014) . Similar evidence is available for the auditory system (e.g., Tiitinen et al., 1993; Debener et al., 2003) and the tactile system (e.g., Bauer et al., 2006) . In all these studies, attention was observed to specifically enhance gamma-band activity. An MEG study also demonstrated that attention selectively modulates large-scale coupling of oscillatory signals in the human brain (Siegel et al., 2008) . Subjects were simultaneously presented with two weak motion stimuli in the left and right visual hemifield. At the beginning of each trial, a cue instructed subjects to attend to one of the two stimuli and to assess its motion direction. The authors combined MEG with source reconstruction to characterize the phase coherence between motionsensitive visual areas, the posterior parietal cortex and the frontal eye fields. Attention selectively enhanced gamma-band phase coherence between these regions in the hemisphere that processed the attended stimulus. This enhancement in the gamma-band was accompanied by a reduction of coherence in the alpha-and beta-range. Other findings also suggest an important role for lower frequencies. One MEG study (Gross et al., 2004) investigated the neuronal basis of the attentional blink, that is, a transient reduction of attention which often occurs if more than one target has to be processed in a series of rapidly presented stimuli. When subjects successfully detected target letters in a rapid visual stream of letters, coherent beta-band oscillations were enhanced between MEG sensors overlying the temporal cortex, prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex. Thus, fluctuations in the strength of large-scale beta-band coherence may reflect fluctuations in visual attention that, in turn, cause fluctuations in behavioral performance.Taken together, the studies reviewed above clearly suggest that neural oscillations and local as well as long-range coupling of oscillatory signals are highly relevant for attentional selection. Hence, it can be argued that these mechanisms may be highly relevant for regulating the access of signals to the conscious workspace. However, it should be mentioned that the relation between attention and consciousness is controversial (Tallon-Baudry, 2011). While some authors argue that attention (at least in many cases) may be a prerequisite for access of signals to consciousness (Newman and Baars, 1993; Dehaene et al., 2006) , others have proposed that processes underlying attention and consciousness may operate in a more parallel fashion (Lamme, 2003; Koch and Tsuchiya, 2007; Tallon-Baudry, 2011; see also Chapter 5) . This is supported by experiments that have attempted to dissociate attentional selection and conscious access. In recent studies by Tallon-Baudry (2008, 2009) , subjects were cued to attend to the left or to the right hemifield, and were then presented with a faint oriented grating, either on the attended or unattended side. On each trial, subjects were asked whether they had consciously experienced the stimulus or not. Each stimulus can therefore be classified, on the one hand, as attended or unattended and, on the other hand, as consciously perceived or not. Interestingly, these two cognitive functions were expressed separately in distinct sub-frequency ranges within the gamma range.Apparently, further work will be needed to clarify the relation between attention and consciousness. The data on bistable perception and on stimulus masking discussed above suggest that selection of contents for access to awareness is also possible without strong involvement of attentional control. Thus, communication by specific coupling of oscillatory signals may provide a rather generic mechanism which may come into play in both attentional and non-attentional forms of signal selection.Most accounts on the neural mechanisms of consciousness assume that awareness is necessarily associated with some form of short-term memory and that conscious contents need to be maintained in working memory (Crick and Koch, 1990; Tononi and Edelman, 1998; Lamme, 2003; Baars et al., 2013) . It had been postulated early on that coupled oscillations might not only serve for selecting relevant signals, but that the same mechanism might support working memory by transiently stabilizing, through synchrony, the relevant neuronal population (Crick and Koch, 1990) . The relationship between oscillations and working memory has been the subject of a large number of studies, which have been reviewed comprehensively by other authors (see Fell and Axmacher, 2011; Lisman and Jensen, 2013; Roux and Uhlhaas, 2013 ). These studies demonstrate the relevance of oscillatory signals in multiple frequency ranges for working memory processes. In particular, theta-band oscillations and gamma-band oscillations have been shown to be relevant for temporally structuring and maintaining working memory contents (Jensen and Lisman, 2005; Lisman and Jensen, 2013) .Taken together, these data demonstrate that processes relevant to selecting and maintaining the contents of conscious mental states can be associated with specific changes in neural synchrony, thus supporting the proposal that coherence in neuronal assemblies may be a necessary condition for the occurrence of awareness (Crick and Koch, 1990; Engel et al., 1999; . The data suggest that the selection of signals for access to awareness is not only dependent on bottom-up factors, but also strongly constrained by intrinsically generated large-scale dynamic patterns, which result from reentrant interactions of prefrontal, premotor, memory, and limbic regions with sensory brain areas. As suggested by Tononi and Edelman (1998) , large-scale assemblies activated by such interactions may constitute a \"dynamic core\" that could control the access of signals to awareness and provide the substrate for a global workspace (Newman and Baars, 1993; Dehaene et al., 2006; Dehaene and Changeux, 2011) .", "citance": "Combining a similar paradigm with intracranial recordings in epilepsy patients, another study has observed enhanced beta-band coherence for visible compared to invisible stimuli (Gaillard et al., 2009) .", "claims": [{"text": "Beta-band coherence is diminished for visible stimuli over invisible stimuli.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Beta-band coherence is enhanced for visible stimuli over invisible stimuli.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

It attracts particular attention because, in contrast with other lipoproteins, as many physiological functions of HDL influence the cardiovascular system in favourable ways unless HDL is modified pathologically. The functions of HDL that have recently attracted attention include anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities. High anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of HDL are associated with protection from cardiovascular disease. Atheroprotective activities, as well as a functional deficiency of HDL, ultimately depend on the protein and lipid composition of HDL. Further, numerous epidemiological studies have shown a protective association between HDL-cholesterol and cognitive impairment. Oxidative stress, including lipid peroxidation, has been shown to be the mediator of the pathologic effects of numerous risk factors of Alzheimer's disease. Lifestyle interventions proven to increase HDL- cholesterol levels including \"healthy\" diet, regular exercise, weight control, and smoking cessation have also been shown to provide neuro-protective effects. This review will focus on current knowledge of the beneficial effects of HDL-cholesterol as it relates to cardiovascular diseases, breast and lung cancers, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, as well as its neuroprotective potential in reducing the risk of Alzheimer's disease and dementia.", "citation_paragraph": "Reductions in LDL-cholesterol using statins form the cornerstone of treatment of hyperlipidemia to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Low serum concentrations of HDLcholesterol are one of the major risk factors for adverse events related to coronary atherosclerosis [8] and are highly prevalent among patients with acute coronary syndromes [13] . Niacin is the most effective therapy available for the treatment of low HDL-cholesterol, with a nonlinear dose-related increase in HDL-cholesterol of approximately 20% observed with modest drug doses (approximately 1 g per day) [14, 15] . In the Collaborative Atorvastatin Study Group which involved a randomized trial of the effects of atorvastatin and niacin in patients with combined hyperlipidemia or isolated hypertriglyceridemia, atorvastatin increased HDL-cholesterol by 4% and niacin by 25% [16] . The specific mechanism of action of niacin is not well understood, but it appears to reduce Apo B secretion, thereby lowering both very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and LDL, increasing Apo A-I, and lowering lipoprotein(a) [17] . The ARBITER (Arterial Biology for the Investigation of the Treatment Effects of Reducing Cholesterol-) 2 study examined the effects of niacin added to background statin therapy on HDL-cholesterol and carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), a validated surrogate cardiovascular end point [18] . After 12 months of therapy, extended-release niacin increased HDL-cholesterol by 21% and decreased the rate of CIMT progression [18] . Therefore, the addition of extendedrelease niacin to statin therapy slowed the progression of atherosclerosis among individuals with known coronary heart disease and moderately low HDL-cholesterol [18] .In the Helsinki Heart Study and the Veterans Affairs High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Intervention Trial (VA-HIT), treatment with gemfibrozil was associated with reduction in CVD events [19, 20] . The Helsinki Heart Study examined the effect of gemfibrozil on lipid parameters and cardiovascular outcomes among high-risk middle-aged men without IHD and with primary dyslipidemia [19] . After 5 years of follow-up, treatment with gemfibrozil increased HDL-cholesterol by 11%, decreased LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides by 11% and 35%, respectively, and reduced the incidence of MI and IHD death by 34%. The study demonstrated that for every one (1) mg/dL increase in HDL-cholesterol, the CHD risk decreased by 2% to 3%, independent of changes in LDL-cholesterol [19] . In the VA-HIT cohort, gemfibrozil was associated with a significant 22% reduction in the risk of fatal and nonfatal CHD, and it significantly reduced the relative risk of investigatordesignated stroke [20] . Some evidence indicates that the benefits seen in the VA-HIT cohort may be partly due to additional effects of fibrates on apolipoprotein synthesis and lipoprotein metabolism [21, 22] . In contrast, the results of studies using other fibrates such as bezafibrate and fenofibrate have been negative. Bezafibrate has no effect on the incidence of CHD and of stroke combined but may reduce the incidence of nonfatal coronary events, particularly in those aged <65 years at entry, in whom all coronary events may also be reduced [23] . Fenofibrate did not significantly reduce the risk of the primary outcome of coronary events; Cholesterol 3 however, it did reduce total cardiovascular events, mainly due to fewer non-fatal MIs and revascularisations [24] .", "citance": "Bezafibrate has no effect on the incidence of CHD and of stroke combined but may reduce the incidence of nonfatal coronary events, particularly in those aged <65 years at entry, in whom all coronary events may also be reduced [23] .", "claims": [{"text": "Bezafibrate reduces the incidence of nonfatal coronary events", "subject": "Bezafibrate", "is_negation": false}]}

SRA decreases the expression of cdkis p21 and p27 and it increases phosphorylation of Cdk1 [146, 147] .

Factors at differing stages of life have been linked to breast cancer risk, although rarely studied simultaneously. We aimed to investigate whether birth weight and factors later in life were associated with mammographic density in the Newcastle Thousand Families Study. The Study originally consisted of all 1142 babies born in May and June 1947 to mothers resident in Newcastle upon Tyne in Northern England. Detailed information was collected prospectively during childhood, including birth weight and socio-economic circumstances. At age 49\u201351 years, 574 study members completed a \u2018Health and Lifestyle\u2019 questionnaire. Of the 307 surviving women who returned these questionnaires, 199 returned a further questionnaire asking for details of routine mammographic screening, their reproductive and contraceptive history. Mammographic patterns were coded into Wolfe categories. This was analysed, by ordinal logistic regression, in relation to a range of variables at different stages of life. Increased standardised birth weight (odds ratio, OR 1.32 (95% CI 1.02\u20131.71) P = 0.03) was a significant independent predictor of higher density. Increasing body mass index (BMI) was predictive of lower density (OR 0.86 per Kg/m2 (95% CI 0.81\u20130.92) P < 0.001), as was having reached menopause (OR, compared to pre- and peri-menopausal, 0.41 (95% CI 0.23\u20130.73) P = 0.002). Interactions were seen between menopausal status and both BMI and age at menarche (P = 0.06) on density, although for neither did the direction of association change. After adjustment for factors acting throughout life, we identified a significant association between standardised birth weight and density in adulthood, consistent with previous research suggesting that heavier babies have an increased risk of breast cancer in later life. We also confirmed associations between both BMI and menopausal status.", "citation_paragraph": "Breast cancer still remains the most common form of cancer among women in the developed world. For this reason, women aged over 50 in the United Kingdom are offered regular mammograms as part of a national screening programme within the National Health Service, with an extension to include all women over 47 by 2012. Variation in mammographic patterns depends on the relative amounts of fat, and epithelial and connective tissue present [1] . Dense mammographic patterns (i.e. those with mainly epithelial and stromal tissues) have been found to be strongly associated with an increased risk of subsequent breast cancer [2] [3] [4] [5] . Whilst a number of risk factors have been identified for breast cancer, their association with mammographic density is less well documented.Birth-weight has been reported to be positively associated with breast cancer [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] , particularly among premenopausal women [6, 10] . However, the limited research so far into the association between birth weight and mammographic density has reported inconsistent findings [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . A number of other factors have been identified as risk factors for breast cancer, including exposure to oestrogen and other hormones [17] , pregnancy-related factors, such as older age at first birth, higher parity, older age at last birth, short duration of breast feeding [18] early menarche [19] , and levels of body fat, the risk relating to the latter varying with pre-and post-menopausal breast cancers [20] . These factors have, to varying degrees, also been associated with increased mammographic density. However, many of the studies into these associations have not been able to adjust for factors at different stages of life or to use prospectively collected information regarding early life.The understanding of those factors from across a woman's life, which may affect her mammographic patterns may help us to explain further factors which influence breast cancer, and may also clarify the biological pathways involved. Furthermore, the identification of factors that influence mammographic patterns, but are not thought to influence breast cancer risk, may help us to develop better algorithms for the identification of women at risk of breast cancer and, hence, reduce false-positive screening results.

{"s2orc_id": 1172782, "title": "Comparing the results of bisphosphonate use in clinical trials with actual practice: a case of apples and oranges?", "abstract": "Multiple randomized clinical trials have confirmed the ability of bisphosphonates to reduce or delay skeletal related events (SREs) when given in combination with either hormonal or chemotherapy to breast cancer patients with bone metastases. The use of bisphosphonates has therefore become a standard of care for the secondary prevention of skeletal complications in these patients.    While the hazard ratios of benefit are impressive for the reduction and delay of SREs it is however important to appreciate that the patients enrolled onto these trials were restricted to those with a life expectancy of at least six months and were frequently over represented with patients with bone only disease. These patient populations are those who were most likely to derive maximum benefit from treatment. Patients treated in actual clinical practice are a more heterogeneous population with often an inherently poorer prognosis. It is likely that they do not derive the same degree of benefit.    This paper reviews the use and outcomes of treatment with bisphosphonates in a cohort of 190 breast cancer patients with bone metastases treated at three Canadian centers. It highlights the differences between clinical practice and trial populations and discusses why we cannot estimate the true order of magnitude of benefit for treatment with bisphosphonates in an off trial setting.

However, many uncertainties remain regarding their use, including the optimal duration and timing of treatment. Indeed it is even unclear which patients should be treated and which should not 5 .This review has already highlighted the three major differences between trial populations and patients treated in routine clinical practice. Only 29% of patients in our clinical practice population had bone-only disease, meaning that the overall group had an inherently poor prognosis. They were probably less likely to benefit from bisphosphonate treatment because they would likely not live long enough to gain the time-dependent benefits of treatment 8 . They were sicker overall as reflected in the much shorter time to first SRE. Patients in our clinical population, most of whom had bone and visceral metastases, experienced fewer SREs than did the randomized trial populations-with the exception of the Japanese trial patients 1 . This finding supports previous work by Plunkett and colleagues, who reported that patients with bone-only disease at the time of diagnosis of skeletal metastases were 3-4 times more likely than those with bone and liver disease to develop pathologic long-bone fractures 16 . The time to long-bone fracture was similar for all groups, but the least number of fractures occurred in the patients with concomitant visceral metastases. This finding reflects the shorter survival time for patients with visceral disease (5.5 months vs. 2.2 years). Therefore, patients with bone-only metastases are the ones who tend to live long enough to derive the time-dependent benefits of bisphosphonate treatment.Evaluating the baseline SRE hazard to determine its shape would be very interesting. Nonparametric approaches such as the Cox proportional hazards model and repeated events analysis do not permit a The proportion of patients developing at least one SRE was lower in the non-study population, but notably, although rates of episodes of radiation treatment, surgery, spinal cord compression, and hypercalcemia were comparable between the groups, significantly fewer fractures were reported in the non-study group than in the randomized trials group.In clinical practice, patients do not tend to undergo serial imaging if they are asymptomatic. The events recorded are those that are clinically relevant. In contrast, patients enrolled in the randomized trials have serial X-rays performed at predefined intervals 11, 12, 14 . This process captures symptomatic and asymptomatic events alike, thus ignoring pain, which is the most frequently reported symptom in daily practice 17 . By performing serial imaging and including asymptomatic lesions-in particular, isolated rib or vertebral lesionsthe trials may have overestimated the benefits of treatment. As a result, the data cannot be extrapolated to an estimate of the true clinical benefit for symptomatic lesions-the lesions that are important to patients.The results from our study are consistent with previous published work 18 . Liauw et al. recently reported that, in a cohort of 110 patients with stage IV breast carcinoma being treated with intravenous zoledronate or pamidronate, 30% developed a SRE in the 12-month follow-up period. Only 9% of patients in that group experienced a fracture. Although the median time to first SRE was much longer at 365 days, this result can perhaps be explained by the fact that 58% of the patients in that cohort had bone-only disease and therefore a better overall prognosis.", "citance": "They were probably less likely to benefit from bisphosphonate treatment because they would likely not live long enough to gain the time-dependent benefits of treatment 8 .", "claims": [{"text": "Bisphosphonate treatment benefits are time dependent.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

The current clinical standard of treatment includes the administration of systemic bisphosphonates (BP) to reduce metastatically induced bone destruction. However, response to BPs can vary both within and between patients, which motivates the need for additional treatment options for spinal metastasis. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been shown to be effective at treating metastatic lesions secondary to breast cancer in an athymic rat model, and is proposed as a treatment for spinal metastasis. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of PDT, alone or in combination with previously administered systemic BPs, on the structural and mechanical integrity of both healthy and metastatically involved vertebrae. Human breast carcinoma cells (MT-1) were inoculated into athymic rats (day 0). At 14 days, a single PDT treatment was administered, with and without previous BP treatment at day 7. In addition to causing tumor necrosis in metastatically involved vertebrae, PDT significantly reduced bone loss, resulting in strengthening of the vertebrae compared to untreated controls. Combined treatment with BP + PDT further enhanced bone architecture and strength in both metastatically involved and healthy bone. Overall, the ability of PDT to both ablate malignant tissue and improve the structural integrity of vertebral bone motivates its consideration as a local minimally invasive treatment for spinal metastasis secondary to breast cancer.", "citation_paragraph": "The spine is a common site of bony metastasis in patients with breast cancer [1] . Clinical treatments for spinal metastases should both provide mechanical stability and reduce tumor burden. Current treatment for spinal metastasis involves a multi-modal approach that includes systemic chemotherapy and bisphosphonates (BP) as adjuvant therapies to local treatments such as radiation therapy or surgery [2] . However, tumor response varies considerably across patients. There remains a need for local tumor ablative strategies that can complement existing open or minimally invasive spinal stabilizing (e.g., vertebroplasty/ kyphoplasty) surgical intervention for patients who respond poorly to existing treatments [2] .Systemic BP treatment is a clinical standard of care for inhibiting osteoclast-mediated bone resorption in breast cancer patients with skeletal disease. Clinical studies demonstrated that BPs significantly reduce the odds of vertebral fracture in spinal metastasis patients, however, their efficacy is variable dependent on primary cancer cell type [3] . In vivo studies in preclinical models have also shown that BPs do not inhibit metastatic progression once vertebral tumors have grown beyond a critical size [4] . This suggests that BPs may be less effective at treating patients with more advanced cancers, motivating the need for alternative therapies to impede metastatic growth and subsequent bony fracture.Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been used to treat a variety of cancers where the tumor is accessible by an external light source. PDT involves topical or systemic administration of a photosensitizer that accumulates preferentially in tumor tissue through differential uptake/ clearance relative to normal tissue, and becomes activated by light at a wavelength specific to the drug. Activation of the photosensitizer in the presence of molecular oxygen leads to generation of highly reactive singlet oxygen, which in turn causes tumor cell toxicity and tissue necrosis. Since both photosensitizer and light are simultaneously required for a photodynamic effect, therapeutic effects can be achieved locally without causing substantial damage to surrounding tissues.Using a transpedicular approach adapted from vertebroplasty/kyphoplasty to deliver light to the vertebral body, PDT can be utilized to treat spinal metastatic lesions. Previous work has shown that a single PDT treatment using 1.0 mg/kg of benzoporphyrin derivative monoacid ring A (BPD-MA) photosensitizer, a 15-min drug-light interval, and a total light dose of 75 J at a power output of 100 mW is the optimized setting for safe and effective ablation of vertebral tumors in a preclinical model of breast cancer spinal metastasis [5] . It has also been shown that PDT administered to healthy rats led to increased vertebral bone formation and mechanical strength [6] . This suggests that PDT may be able to ablate malignant tumor tissue and simultaneously improve the mechanical integrity of metastatically involved vertebrae. However, it is unknown whether these bone-enhancing effects would similarly occur in metastatically involved bone and in bone previously treated with BPs. Hence, this study was designed to examine the effects of PDT on the structural and mechanical properties of both healthy and tumor-involved bone, alone and in combination with systemic BPs.", "citance": "Clinical studies demonstrated that BPs significantly reduce the odds of vertebral fracture in spinal metastasis patients, however, their efficacy is variable dependent on primary cancer cell type [3] .", "claims": [{"text": "Bisphosphonates significatly raise the odds of vertebral fracture in spinal metastasis patients, depending on primary cancer cell type.", "subject": "bisphosphonates", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Bisphosphonates significatly reduce the odds of vertebral fracture in spinal metastasis patients, depending on primary cancer cell type.

In normal physiological conditions, neuronal cell death is restricted in the adult brain, even in aged individuals. However, in the pathological conditions of various neurodegenerative diseases, cell death and shrinkage in a specific region of the brain represent a fundamental pathological feature across different neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we will briefly go through the general pathways of cell death and describe evidence for cell death in the context of individual common neurodegenerative diseases, discussing our current understanding of cell death by connecting with renowned pathogenic proteins, including Tau, amyloid-beta, alpha-synuclein, huntingtin and TDP-43.", "citation_paragraph": "In normal physiological conditions, TDP-43 is localized mainly to the nucleus, where the protein can directly bind to the DNA and regulate gene expression. TDP-43 also plays a role in regulating RNA metabolism [146] . In pathological conditions, however, mutated TDP-43 proteins relocate to the cytosol and form aggregates. The toxicity of TDP-43 is associated with mitochondria dysfunction, ROS production and nucleocytoplasmic transport impairment [147, 148] . It has been reported that TDP-43 preferentially locates to the mitochondria and interacts with respiratory complex I proteins ND3 and ND6 to induce a complex disassembly; thus, blocking such an interaction can suppress TDP-43-induced neuronal loss [149] . However, whether apoptosis mediates neuronal loss induced by TDP-43 is still under debate [150] [151] [152] [153] . In one study, it was found that TDP-43 induces the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins in a p53-dependent manner and inhibiting p53 prevented the neuronal cell death [153] . However, others have suggested that neuronal loss in ALS brains, either derived from patients or from engineered animal models, is independent of caspase-3 activation [151, 152] . In one study that co-cultured astrocytes isolated from sporadic ALS patients with human embryonic stem cell-derived motor neurons, profound neuronal losses were observed [151] . In this system, the application of a pan-caspase inhibitor lowered the caspase-3 level but did not prevent the neuronal loss [151] .

Hence, they reduce the transmission of the parasite from the patient to the mosquitoes. The present study aimed to assess evidence for this hypothesis from controlled trials.   METHODS All controlled clinical trials evaluating the transmission blocking activity of artemisinin derivatives and primaquine with or without other antimalarials were included in this systematic review. PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Medscape and the Cochrane library were systematically searched without language, publication status or date restrictions. The literature references were also scanned manually. The last search was run on July 15, 2013. Search terms included artemisinin derivatives, primaquine, malaria transmission, transmission blocking/reducing drugs and mosquito infection. The outcome measure was the mosquito infectivity rate after treatment of patients. Data were compared using odds ratio (OR), in random effects models.   RESULTS Nine trials with a total of 13,831 mosquitoes were included in the meta-analysis. After combining the trials, the transmission of P. falciparum to Anopheles mosquitoes were lower in artesunate, artemether-lumefantrine and primaquine groups as compared with their control counterparts with OR of 0.36 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.14-0.90), 0.49 (95% CI, 0.31-0.79) and 0.09 (95% CI, 0.01-0.73); respectively. In non-comparative longitudinal studies, the use of a single-dose of primaquine was shown to deter the transmission of malaria briefly.   CONCLUSION Evidence on the transmission blocking effect of artemisinin derivatives and primaquine is conclusive. Trials evaluating the combined impact of artemisinin derivatives and primaquine on malaria transmission is urgently needed.", "citation_paragraph": "Preventing mosquitoes from biting by the existing tools (e.g. ITNs and IRS) and blocking the transmission of Plasmodium parasites from patients to mosquitoes using agents (vaccine or drugs) may substantially improve public health through reducing the burden of malaria [27] . In areas of stable malaria, a meta-analysis of ITNs on malaria transmission revealed a reduction by 50% [28] . However, a meta-analysis on existing antimalarials to block the transmission of the parasite from patients to mosquitoes has not yet been done to the author's knowledge.The current meta-analysis re-affirmed the advantage of ACTs in reducing transmission of Plasmodium to the mosquitoes. In the overall analysis, the odds of transmission of malaria in artesunate-based combination treatment group was 2.78 times less than the odds of transmission of malaria in antimalarials without artesunate (Figure 2) . Similarly, the odds of malaria transmission to mosquitoes in artemether-lumefantrine treated group was 2 times less than the odds on other antimalarials used in the studies (Figure 3) . Exceptionally, in one trial [16] , the odds of parasite transmission was higher in artesunate-based combination therapy than the standard therapy without artesunate. This difference might be attributed to the use of only one dose of artesunate in the trial.From the current analysis of the published articles, artesunate-and artemether-based therapy could reduce the transmission of the parasite to the mosquitoes. Thus, these medications, in addition to their role in the clinical case management of malaria, can have an impact on the overall transmission rate of malaria and play a role in controlling malaria.Primaquine, the old antimalarial drug mainly used in terminal cure of P. vivax infection, was also tested for its impact on the transmission of Plasmodium to mosquitoes. Trials compared the transmission blocking effect of single-dose primaquine with the conventional antimalarials: sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and pyrimethamine. The current analysis showed that odds of mosquito infection rate was 11 times less for single-dose primaquine relative to the comparative medicine (Figure 4) .In non-comparative longitudinal trials of single-dose primaquine, the current systematic review presented the trends of mosquito infection rate across successive posttreatment days ( Figure 5 ). There was a rapid drop in mosquito infection rate as illustrated in those mosquitoes feeding on the first and second days post-treatment. However, the effect was maintained only for a short period as evidenced by the positivity of mosquitoes biting on some patients after the 10 days of single-dose primaquine therapy.As the trials employed single-dose primaquine therapy, which might target only the mature gametocyte [9] , the continuity of transmission blockade by a single dose of primaquine fails against the new wave of mature gametocytes that appear after primaquine has been washed out [29] . The use of single-dose primaquine blocks the transmission of malaria temporarily ( Figure 5 ). However, combining it with effective antimalarials -like mefloquine used in the trial conducted by Chen and his colleague -results in a disruption of Plasmodium transmission to the vector for a longer period ( Figure 6 ). This might be explained by the fact that the effective schizonticide (mefloquine), by clearing the parasite, dries out the potential source for a new wave of gametocytes.Following the introduction of ACTs in malaria case management, many researchers report the additional benefit of ACTs on the partial gametocytocidal effect compared with the non-ACTs regimens [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . Recently, there is also interest of combining ACTs with single-dose primaquine, particularly in areas with a resistant Plasmodium to ACTs or in the phase of malaria elimination. The addition of primaquine to ACTs results in a further reduction in gametocyte carriage rate that can have implications on the extent of malaria transmission [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . However, the optimal time of administration, treatment duration and dose of primaquine needs to be understood for improved outcomes. Further studies are also required to favours [primaquine] favours [control] Figure 4 Mosquito infection prevalence after blood-meal on primaquine treated malaria patients versus control (standard therapy).

The present paper analysed the transmission blocking activity of artemisinin derivatives and primaquine. The clinical trials of artemisinin derivatives and primaquine focused on An. gambiae and An. stephensi; respectively. None of the identified literatures pertained to other dominant malaria vectors such as An. funestus and An. arabiensis [40] [41] [42] . In all of the trials included for metaanalysis, similar colonies of mosquitoes in both intervention and control groups were used. By so doing, confounding bias related to the variable infection success in the different species of vectors could be avoided. Of course, if the variability in susceptibility of the vectors to P. falciparum infection modified the transmission blocking activity of drugs, trials with different species of malaria vectors having a range of infection success would be required; then systematic reviews should consider subgroup analysis.Like any retrospective study, this systematic review has a number of limitations. The literature search might have missed some trials. The author assumed that missing reports is unlikely for two reasons. Firstly, a proper search strategy was followed to identify literatures. Secondly, the research groups working on transmission blocking trials at the level of mosquitoes are few. Another concern is the comparison of the reference drugs (artemisinin derivatives and primaquine) with a heterogeneous array of antimalarials probably with different gametocytocidal activity, which in turn might obscure some systematic differences between drugs. To minimize these risk, random analytic method was followed in all data analysis, including in those with little heterogeneity.", "citance": "Preventing mosquitoes from biting by the existing tools (e.g. ITNs and IRS) and blocking the transmission of Plasmodium parasites from patients to mosquitoes using agents (vaccine or drugs) may substantially improve public health through reducing the burden of malaria [27] .", "claims": [{"text": "Blocking the transmission of Plasmodium parasites from patients to mosquitos through vaccines and drugs reduces malaria transmission.", "subject": "malaria transmission.", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Blocking the transmission of Plasmodium parasites from patients to mosquitos through vaccines and drugs speeds the rate of malaria transmission.", "subject": "malaria transmission.", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Preventing mosquitos from biting by insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) is not effective in reducing malaria transmission.", "subject": "malaria transmission", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Preventing mosquitos from biting by insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) reduces malaria transmission.", "subject": "malaria transmission", "is_negation": false}]}

Highly conserved core circadian regulatory proteins (CCRPs) maintain an oscillatory expression profile in the central and peripheral tissues. The CCRP include both a positive and negative arm, as well as downstream transcriptional regulators. Recent studies in murine models have determined that the mRNAs encoding the CCRP are present in multiple adipose tissue depots and exhibit a robust oscillatory expression profile. This study set out to examine the expression of CCRP mRNAs in human subcutaneous adipose tissues.   DESIGN Retrospective analysis of total RNA isolated from subcutaneous adipose tissue.   SUBJECTS A total of 150 healthy female and male lean (body mass index (BMI) <25), overweight (BMI between 25 and 29.99) or obese (BMI >30) subjects of varied ethnic backgrounds undergoing elective liposuction or surgical procedures.   RESULTS The expression of the CCRP mRNAs displayed a significant correlation between each other and mRNAs representative of adipogenic biomarkers. Hierarchical cluster analyses of mRNAs isolated from the cohort of female Caucasian subjects (n=116) identified three major clusters based on expression of downstream CCRP mRNAs. The mRNAs encoding D site of albumin promoter-binding protein (DBP), E4 promoter-binding protein 4 (E4BP4), PPARgamma coactivator-1beta (PGC-1beta) and Rev-erbalpha were negatively correlated with BMI in a lean cluster (n=66), positively correlated with BMI in a younger overweight/obese cluster (n=19), and not significantly correlated with BMI in an older, overweight/obese cluster (n=31).   CONCLUSIONS These data confirm and extend findings that link the CCRP and circadian mechanisms to the risk of obesity.", "citation_paragraph": "The earth's rotation around the sun has impacted physiology in all organisms. As a consequence, there has evolved a highly conserved set of genes encoding core circadian regulatory proteins (CCRP (1, 2) . Two of these proteins, brain muscle Arnt-like-1 (Bmal1) and circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (Clock) or its homolog, neural PAS domain protein 2 (Npas2), serve as the positive arm of the circadian pathway (1, 2) . They heterodimerize and bind to conserved E-box cis elements in the promoters of downstream targets (1, 2) . Among their many actions, Bmal1-Clock or Bmal1-Npas2 heterodimers activate transcription of their own negative regulators, cryptochrome (Cry) and period (Per), which heterodimerize and repress transcription of Bmal1 through a feedback mechanism (1, 2) . This results in an oscillatory anti-phase expression profile between the positive and negative arms of the pathway that repeats every 24 hour cycle (1, 2) . Additional downstream genes regulated by Bmal1-Clock include the transcription factors D site of albumin promoter binding protein (DBP), E4 promoter binding protein 4 (E4BP4), and the nuclear hormone receptor family members Rev-erb \u03b1 and \u03b2 and retinoid-like orphan receptor (ROR) \u03b1 and \u03b3 (1, 2). For purposes of this manuscript, the following genes are encompassed by the term \"CCRP\": (1) The positive arm genes encoding Bmal1, Clock, and Npas2; (2) The negative arm genes encoding Cry and Per isoforms; (3) The downstream targets DBP, E4BP4, Rev-erb and ROR isoforms. Furthermore, the genes encoding glycogen synthase kinase 3 \u03b2, responsible for the phosphorylation and proteasomal targeting of Per, and PPAR\u03b32 Coactivator-1 (PGC1), which has been found to modulate circadian rhythms (3, 4) , are included under the term \"CCRP\".The CCRP have been linked to obesity, metabolism, and sleep disorders. Murine models homozygous for a mutated version of Clock displayed hyperphagia, hypertriglyceridemia, glucose intolerance, and a propensity towards obesity and the metabolic syndrome (5). Exposure to high fat diets has been observed to attenuate, phase advance, and/or disrupt the circadian rhythm in rodent models (6) (7, 8) . Both Bmal1 and Clock have been linked functionally to glucose metabolism in murine models (9) . Recent genotyping studies have identified Clock gene polymorphisms that are associated with an increased risk of obesity and metabolic syndrome in human population studies (10) (11) (12) (13) . Furthermore, murine strains with the Clock mutation or deficient in Bmal1, DBP, Npas2, or Per2 display abnormal sleep/ wake cycles when deprived of photic stimuli as an entrainer (14, 15) (16) (17) (18) (19) . Consistent with this, polymorphisms in the human Clock and Period 3 gene are associated with sleep / wake preferences or disturbances (20) (21) (22) (23) . The importance of the CCRP genes in regulating sleep is of particular relevance. Pioneering clinical and epidemiological research by Van Cauter and others has demonstrated a direct association between human sleep patterns, glucose metabolism, and risk of obesity (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) . Reduced length of sleep has been correlated with increased incidence of obesity at various points in human development (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) .While the CCRP genes play a critical role within the body's master circadian clock located within the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the brain (1), the genes have been detected in multiple peripheral tissues (36, 37) . Their expression profile displays some degree of autonomy since circadian oscillations persist for several days in organs isolated from Per2 promoter/ luciferase reporter transgenic mice in the absence of systemic synchronizing stimuli (37) . The mRNAs encoding the CCRP have been found in multiple murine adipose depots and display a robust circadian oscillation in vivo (38) (39) (40) . Similarly, Bmal1, Cry1, and Per2 have been detected in both subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue obtained from eight morbidly obese human males (41) . In subcutaneous adipose tissue, these CCRP genes correlated with each other as well as parameters associated with the metabolic syndrome (41) . Furthermore, in vitro studies have demonstrated that both mRNAs encoding CCRPs (42) and glucocorticoid-metabolic enzymes (43) can display an oscillatory expression profile in primary adipose-derived stem cell cultures and tissue explants, respectively. Based on these findings, the current study set out to examine the expression of a panel of CCRP mRNAs in subcutaneous adipose tissue obtained from healthy human subjects undergoing elective surgeries.

These hematopoietic progenitor cells interfere with normal hematopoiesis, can escape into the peripheral blood, and infiltrate the lungs and central nervous system (2) . AML can occur in individuals of all ages, but evidence has shown that AML is most common in older patients (>65 years) (3) and that it accounts for 70% of acute leukemia cases in adults (4) . Current treatments include intensive chemotherapy and BM transplantation (5) . Although there have been large improvements in outcome in recent decades, AML remains a life-threatening malignancy, with an 5-year overall survival rate of only 40-45% in young patients and >10% in the elderly, due to either resistance to therapy or relapsed AML (1) . Thus, gaining a better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanism of AML is imperative for the development of more valuable diagnostic and therapeutic targets.Molecular analyses have expanded our understanding of the heterogeneity of AML, which leads to distinct clinical presentations in different cytogenetic and morphological subtypes (6) . It is clear that genetic events [such as point mutations, and insertions and deletions (indels)] and recurrent chromosomal abnormalities (such as numeric abnormalities and translocations) are necessary for the development of AML (7) . For instance, genomic and functional studies have demonstrated two broad classes of mutations that collaborate to cause AML when neither is sufficient to do so in isolation (1, 8) . Class I mutations, such as neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog mutations, confer a proliferative advantage of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), but have no effect on differentiation.

DNA methylation signatures have been used to identify distinct epigenetically defined subtypes in AML (9) . Akalin et al demonstrated that aberrant DNA methylation patterns in AML were highly specific and associated with specific driving genetic lesions (10) . In addition, the findings of Tao et al showed that epigenetic inactivation of microRNA (miRNA/miR)-663 by promoter hypermethylation could be found in AML cell lines and pediatric AML samples (11) . However, the gene methylation signatures in AML are not completely understood. Identifying more differentially methylated genes may provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease. BM mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) are key components of the hematopoietic microenvironment and are particularly important hematopoietic regulators due to their capacity to self-renewal and to differentiate into different stromal cell lines and produce soluble factors facilitating hematopoietic cell maintenance (12) . Previously, Blau et al demonstrated that BM-MSCs from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and AML showed chromosomal abnormalities, suggesting potential involvement of BMSCs in the pathophysiology of MDS/AML (13) . Furthermore, a distinctive gene expression profile of MSCs was identified from pediatric cases of AML compared with healthy donors (14) . However, the gene methylation patterns in BM-MSC from patients with AML have not been fully addressed.In the present study, recently deposited microarray data (deposited on March 29, 2016 ) from a public database were downloaded and reanalyzed to study the methylation status in BM-MSCs from patients with AML.

Rather, most tissue macrophage populations in mice are derived from embryonic precursors, are seeded before birth and can maintain themselves in adults by self-renewal.

Further evidence for the lack of an important contribution of monocytes or other bone marrow-derived progenitors to adult tissue macrophage populations comes from experiments that have been carried out in parabiotic mice 12 .

Scientific findings that support a critical role for the infected monocyte/macrophage in HIV-1-associated diseases, such as neurological disorders and cardiovascular disease, are accumulating. To prevent or treat these HIV-1-related diseases, we need to halt HIV-1 replication in the macrophage reservoir. This article describes our current knowledge of how monocytes and certain macrophage subsets are able to restrict HIV-1 infection, in addition to what makes macrophages respond less well to current antiretroviral drugs as compared with CD4+ T cells. These insights will help to find novel approaches that can be used to meet this challenge.", "citation_paragraph": "Despite impressive results obtained with combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), residual viremia can still be detected when using highly sensitive methods [153, 154] . Furthermore, an increase in viral RNA derived from an additional source other than resting CD4 + T cells is observed with intermittence of cART [155, 156] . There are several cell-specific reasons as to why macrophages facilitate the formation of this viral reservoir: infection of macrophages with HIV-1 is not lytic to these cells [157, 158] , macrophages are more resistant to the cytopathic effects of HIV-1 infection [159] , HIV-1 infection induces antiapoptotic mechanisms in macrophages [160, 161] and macro phages are long-lived cells. In addition, the poor tissue penetration of certain antiretrovirals prevents the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in macrophages that are residing in so called 'sanctuary sites', such as the testis [162, 163] , gut-associated lymphoid tissue [164] [165] [166] and brain [167] . Results from a recent study by Carter et al. demonstrated that the bone marrow also harbors latently infected cells and forms an HIV-1 reservoir [168] . Thus, HIV-1 infection in macro phages is not lytic and virus may accumulate in intracellular vacuoles, allowing the cells to harbor virus for a prolonged period of time. Indeed, in addition to resting memory CD4 + T cells, HIV-1-infected monocytes/macrophages are future science group thought to be an important reservoir for the virus during chronic infection [169] [170] [171] . HIV-1 has also been shown to replicate in monocytes/macrophages during cART, even when no virus is detectable in the plasma. Moreover, HIV-1-infected macrophages may also contribute to the rebound in viral load that has been observed in patients upon discontinuation of cART [171] [172] [173] .Alternatively, host factors such as C/EBPb may restrict HIV-1 transcription in infected tissue macrophages, thereby contributing to viral latency in macrophages and extending the macrophage HIV-1 reservoir [174] . Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that HIV-1-infected macrophages render resting T cells permissive to infection [175, 176] . This indicates that both the resting T cells and the macrophage reservoirs are connected and are therefore not completely independent.Exogenous activation of resting T cells in combination with cART has recently been suggested to overcome latent infection of resting T cells [177] [178] [179] [180] [181] . An in vitro study with alveolar macrophages demonstrated that latent HIV-1 could be activated again [182] , and novel strateand novel strategies to purge the latent HIV-1 reservoir in macrophages in vivo have been proposed recently [183] . Overcoming viral latency in macrophages has been demonstrated in vivo through the inhibition of C/EBPb after the contact of latently infected alveolar macrophages with lymphocytes [184, 185] . However, these approaches are unlikely to end the residual HIV-1 replication in macrophages/microglia, since this reservoir is not only established through latency (latent reservoir), but also through the poor tissue penetration and reduced efficiency of currently used antiretroviral drugs (anatomical reservoir) [186] . The half-life of HIV-1-infected macrophages is unknown, but the half-life of uninfected macrophages is estimated by some to be half a month [187] , although this can be different for HIV-1-infected macrophages and the turnover rate might be highly tissue specific [188] . Specific therapeutic strategies that target HIV-1-infected macrophages are therefore needed. In addition to being a barrier to the complete eradication of HIV-1 from the body, HIV-1-infected macrophages are also associated with specific pathologies in HIV disease.", "citance": "Results from a recent study by Carter et al. demonstrated that the bone marrow also harbors latently infected cells and forms an HIV-1 reservoir [168] .", "claims": [{"text": "Bone marrow harbors latently infected cells and forms an HIV-1 reservoir.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Therefore, the present study aimed to report specific harmful BRCA1/2 mutations in the Chinese population and discuss the clinicopathological features in mutation carriers. BRCA1/2 germline mutation tests for 71 patients with breast cancer from a hereditarily high-risk Chinese population were performed using next-generation sequencing for identification of deleterious mutations. Furthermore, the clinicopathological features between BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and non-carriers were compared. A total of 13/71 (18.3%) patients carried a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (7 BRCA1 and 6 BRCA2). The incidence of BRCA1/2 mutation in patients with bilateral breast cancer and patients with family history were 25, and 32.2%, respectively. Eleven pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations were identified in 13 patients, among the mutation sites 7 were never reported before in Asian populations. The age at diagnosis of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers was older compared with non-mutation carriers (44.73 vs. 35.39 years; P=0.001) in this cohort. BRCA1/2 deleterious mutation carriers had a significantly lower chance of human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (Her-2) positive status (P=0.010), higher tumor grade at diagnosis (P=0.009), higher probability to have a family history (P=0.016) and older age at diagnosis. Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status were significantly different between BRCA1, and BRCA2 mutation carriers (P=0.007). The current interpretation of BRCA1/2 status can only explain a small part of hereditary high-risk breast cancer.

{"s2orc_id": 11225933, "title": "Spermatogenesis-Specific Features of the Meiotic Program in Caenorhabditis elegans", "abstract": "In most sexually reproducing organisms, the fundamental process of meiosis is implemented concurrently with two differentiation programs that occur at different rates and generate distinct cell types, sperm and oocytes. However, little is known about how the meiotic program is influenced by such contrasting developmental programs. Here we present a detailed timeline of late meiotic prophase during spermatogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans using cytological and molecular landmarks to interrelate changes in chromosome dynamics with germ cell cellularization, spindle formation, and cell cycle transitions. This analysis expands our understanding C. elegans spermatogenesis, as it identifies multiple spermatogenesis-specific features of the meiotic program and provides a framework for comparative studies. Post-pachytene chromatin of spermatocytes is distinct from that of oocytes in both composition and morphology. Strikingly, C. elegans spermatogenesis includes a previously undescribed karyosome stage, a common but poorly understood feature of meiosis in many organisms. We find that karyosome formation, in which chromosomes form a constricted mass within an intact nuclear envelope, follows desynapsis, involves a global down-regulation of transcription, and may support the sequential activation of multiple kinases that prepare spermatocytes for meiotic divisions. In spermatocytes, the presence of centrioles alters both the relative timing of meiotic spindle assembly and its ultimate structure. These microtubule differences are accompanied by differences in kinetochores, which connect microtubules to chromosomes. The sperm-specific features of meiosis revealed here illuminate how the underlying molecular machinery required for meiosis is differentially regulated in each sex.", "citation_paragraph": "Because spermatocytes and oocytes differ in chromatin composition and meiotic spindle structure and assembly, we anticipated that kinetochores, which link chromosomes to microtubules, might also vary in structure or assembly. During C. elegans mitosis, kinetochores are large, plaque-like structures, reflecting the holocentric nature of their chromosomes [60, 61] . Studies of mitotic cells suggest a stepwise assembly of kinetochores [62, 63] in which the evolutionarily conserved inner kinetochore components HCP-3 CENP-A and HCP-4 CENP-C establish a specialized chromatin base for the association of outer kinetochore proteins, which interface with spindle microtubules. However, meiotic-specific kinetochore structures may be required for orienting sister chromatids towards microtubules from the same spindle pole for the first meiotic division. Kinetochores of spermatocytes and oocytes may also differ since spermatocyte spindles are centriole-based while oocyte spindles are not. In fact, proteomic studies have identified gamete-specific differences in the levels of C. elegans kinetochore proteins [17] . Specifically, HCP-4 CENP-C was enriched in spermatogenic chromatin while HCP-3 CENP-A was enriched in oogenic chromatin. Similarly, the outer kinetochore protein HCP-1 was detected in chromatin preparations from oogenic germ cells but not from sperm.In this study, immunoanalysis of five different kinetochore proteins revealed striking sex-specific differences in the relative levels of specific kinetochore proteins. Although we found high levels of the inner kinetochore protein HCP-3 CENP-A and the outer kinetochore protein HCP-1 in oocytes, these proteins were barely detectable in spermatocytes ( Figure 7A and 7E) . Conversely, HCP-4 CENP-C was highly abundant in spermatocytes ( Figure 7B ). Because inner kinetochore components are intimately incorporated into chromatin, the near absence of detectable HCP-3 CENP-A on spermatocyte chromosomes suggests that spermatocytes and oocytes differ in the organization of their kinetochore components. The CENP-F homologs, HCP-1 and HCP-2 are thought to function non-redundantly in mitotic spindle checkpoint assembly but redundantly in mitotic chromosome segregation [64] [65] [66] . The near absence of detectable HCP-1 suggests that HCP-2 may function non-redundantly in spermatogenesis ( Figure 7D and 7E) .Notably, while all other kinetochore proteins were lost after anaphase II, HCP-4 CENP-C perdured, encircling the post-meiotic sperm chromatin mass. Localization patterns revealed similarities and differences in the kinetochores of spermatocytes and oocytes. Interestingly, HCP-3 CENP-A or HCP-4 CENP-C localization differed strikingly in spermatocytes and oocytes ( Figure 7A and 7B) . In oocytes, these proteins co-localize with the chromatin in an ''inner'' pattern, while in spermatocytes they ''surround'' the spermatocyte chromosomes in a pattern previously described for outer kinetochore proteins. Antibody inaccessibility is unlikely to account for this difference as co-immunostaining with antihistone H1 antibody showed an even distribution of histone H1 on meiotically dividing chromosomes (data not shown). HIM-10, an evolutionarily conserved outer kinetochore protein surrounded the spermatocyte and oocyte chromosomes in a similar manner ( Figure 7C and [61] ). The outer kinetochore protein HCP-2 also surrounded spermatocyte chromatin, yet in comparison to HIM-10, its minimal co-localization with the chromatin suggests a less intimate association ( Figure 7C and 7D). HCP-2 localized completely between separating chromosomes in anaphase I then both asymmetrically and symmetrically on metaphase II chromosomes, indicating HCP-2 relocalizes from one side of the chromosomes to surround DNA prior to meiosis II (data not shown). Thus in spermatocytes, inner kinetochore proteins exhibit a localization patterns more similar to outer kinetochores.This differential enrichment and localization of kinetochore components is the first evidence suggesting that the molecular machinery required for chromosome segregation in spermatocytes may differ from that in either oocytes or mitotically dividing cells. Sex-specific differences in the molecular composition of meiotic kinetochores may reflect differences either in the structure of the meiotic chromosomes or in the molecular requirements for interacting with structurally distinct meiotic spindle structures.", "citance": "In fact, proteomic studies have identified gamete-specific differences in the levels of C. elegans kinetochore proteins [17] .", "claims": [{"text": "C. elegans have gamete-specific differences in levels of kinetochore proteins.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Based on the beneficial outcomes of its activation on metabolism, AMPK has emerged as an attractive target for the treatment of metabolic diseases. Identification of novel downstream targets of AMPK beyond the regulation of energy metabolism has renewed considerable attention in exploiting AMPK signaling for novel therapeutic targeting strategies including treatment of cancer and inflammatory diseases. The complexity of AMPK system with tissue\u2010 and species\u2010specific expression of multiple isoform combination regulated by various inputs, post\u2010traductional modifications and subcellular locations presents unique challenges for drug discovery.

C2 activates AMPK with an EC 50 in the low nanomolar range, which is 1000-fold lower than AMP. As AMP, it protects against AMPK\u03b1-Thr172 dephosphorylation. However, it does not modulate other AMP-regulated enzymes such as glycogen phosphorylase, phosphofructokinase or fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase [80] . This compound showed high potency for activation of AMPK in cells when delivered as a pro-drug, C13, a phosphonate diester converted by cellular esterases into C2. It has been reported that C13 potently inhibited hepatic lipogenesis and stimulated fatty acid oxidation in primary mouse hepatocytes [80, 96] and reduced lipogenesis in mice [112] . Crystal structures of C2 bound to AMPK revealed two C2-binding sites in the AMPK \u03b3 subunit distinct from nucleotide-binding sites [85] . The two C2 molecules bind at the interface of CBS 1, 3, and 4, with the phosphate groups of both C2 molecules overlapping the phosphate binding sites of AMP in sites 1 and 4. These findings demonstrate that it is possible to develop compounds binding outside the ADaM site and open exciting possibility for developing isoform-selective \u03b3-binding AMPK activators. C2 activates complexes containing the \u03b31-and \u03b32-isoforms but not the \u03b33-isoform, suggesting different structural features between the \u03b3 isoforms that can be exploited in future rational drug design.Interestingly, C2, like AMP, worked synergistically with A-769662 to activate dephosphorylated AMPK [85] . Unexpectedly, C2 is selective for AMPK complexes containing the \u03b11-isoform rather than \u03b12-isoform [80] .

Little is known about the cause of inferior host defense after immune cell reconstitution. Here, we exploited a murine syngeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) model of late infection with gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV-68) to determine the role of conventional dendritic cell (cDC) trafficking in adaptive immunity in BMT mice. Post infection, the expression of chemokine Ccl21 in the lung is reduced and the migration of cDCs into lung draining lymph nodes (dLNs) is impaired in BMT mice, limiting the opportunity for cDCs to prime Th cells in the dLNs. While cDC subsets are redundant in priming Th1 cells, Notch2 functions in cDC2s are required for priming increased Th17 responses in BMT mice and cDC1s can lessen this activity. Importantly, Th17 cells can be primed both in the lungs and dLNs, allowing for increased Th17 responses without optimum cDC trafficking in BMT mice. Taken together, impaired cDC trafficking in BMT mice reduces protective Th1 responses and allows increased pathogenic Th17 responses. Thus, we have revealed a previously unknown mechanism for BMT procedures to cause long-term inferior immune responses to herpes viral infection.", "citation_paragraph": "To examine whether impaired cDC migration affects subsequent priming of Th cells in lung dLNs, we enumerated and characterized the cells in the dLNs at 7 dpi with MHV-68. Indeed, the absolute numbers of Th1 cells in the dLNs of BMT mice are significantly reduced ( Figure 3A) , consistent with limited Th1 responses in BMT mice. Notably, although fewer in cell counts, the percentages of Th1 cells within the dLNs are comparable between non-BMT and BMT mice ( Figure 3A) , suggesting that the cDCs of BMT mice are potent in priming Th1 responses once reaching the dLNs. While the numbers of Th17 cells are comparable between normal and BMT mice in the dLNs, the Th17 cells of BMT mice make up a larger percentage of the population than that in non-BMT mice ( Figure 3B ), further confirming a Th17-skewed response. It has been previously reported that both allogeneic and congeneic BMT reduces steady state cellularity in LNs after immune reconstitution and that BMT mice generate poor responses to bacterial and viral infections (19) (20) (21) . Similarly, we also found that there is about a three-fold reduction in total cell numbers in BMT lung dLNs at 7 dpi, with significantly fewer mDCs, CD4 + Th cells, CD8 + T cells and B cells in the BMT dLNs ( Figure 3C ).BMT down regulates the expression of chemokine Ccl21 in the lung and dLN but does not affect the surface expression of CCR7 on cDCs CC-chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) is essential for mature cDCs to sense and follow the gradient of CCL21 towards and into the lumen of lymphatic vessels leading to dLNs (43) . Interestingly, the expression of CCR7 on lung cDCs is similar between non-BMT and BMT mice at 2 dpi when activated lung cDCs are ready to migrate ( Figure 4A ). There are three distinct Ccl21 genes in the mouse. Ccl21a encodes CCL21Ser and is predominantly expressed in lymphoid organs, while Ccl21b and Ccl21c both encode CCL21Leu and are predominantly expressed in nonimmune organs, such as the lung (44). CCL19 is the other ligand for CCR7, and is also predominantly present within the dLNs (45) . We found that the expression levels of Ccl21a and Ccl21b/c are reduced in the lungs of BMT mice at 3 dpi ( Figure 4B ), consistent with the observation that cDCs stall in the lungs in BMT mice after infection with MHV-68. We also note that levels of Ccl21a and Ccl21b/c transcripts are similar between the dLNs of non-BMT and BMT mice prior to infection and at 3 dpi ( Figure 4B) ; however, both BMT and non-BMT dLNs show reduced transcription of Ccl21 at 7 dpi, but BMT dLNs show greater reduction ( Figure   4B ). To further determine the cells producing CCL21 in the lungs, we have performed multiple-color immunofluorescence staining of lung frozen sections. Labelling of CD90.2 protein identifies lymph vessels in the lung (46) . Similar to previous studies [reviewed in (47)], we found that CCL21 protein is exclusively expressed in lymphatic endothelial cells in the lung prior to infection (data not shown) and at 3 dpi ( Figure 4C) . Importantly, the number of CD11c + cells, presumably cDCs, within or in contact with lymph vessels is reduced in BMT lungs at 3 dpi ( Figure 4C ). These observations indicate that the impaired cDC migration in BMT mice is not due to the regulation of CCR7 on the cDC cell surface, but rather is likely due to insufficient production of CCL21 in the lungs.Disparate functions of cDC1s and cDC2s in priming Th17 differentiation ", "citance": "CCL19 is the other ligand for CCR7, and is also predominantly present within the dLNs (45) .", "claims": [{"text": "CCL19 is a ligand for CCR7.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "CCL19 is absent within dLNs.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "CCL19 is predominantly present within dLNs.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Therapeutic Treg application often requires prolonged in vitro culture to generate sufficient Treg numbers or to optimize their functionality, e.g., via genetic engineering of their antigen receptors. However, purity of clinical Treg expansion cultures is highly variable, and currently, it is impossible to identify and separate stable Tregs from contaminating effector T cells, either ex vivo or after prior expansion. This represents a major obstacle for quality assurance of expanded Tregs and raises significant safety concerns. Here, we describe a Treg activation signature that allows identification and sorting of epigenetically imprinted Tregs even after prolonged in vitro culture. We show that short-term reactivation resulted in expression of CD137 but not CD154 on stable FoxP3+ Tregs that displayed a demethylated Treg-specific demethylated region, high suppressive potential, and lack of inflammatory cytokine expression. We also applied this Treg activation signature for rapid testing of chimeric antigen receptor functionality in human Tregs and identified major differences in the signaling requirements regarding CD137 versus CD28 costimulation. Taken together, CD137+CD154- expression emerges as a universal Treg activation signature ex vivo and upon in vitro expansion allowing the identification and isolation of epigenetically stable antigen-activated Tregs and providing a means for their rapid functional testing in vitro.", "citation_paragraph": "The potential of in vitro generated Tregs to control chronic inflammatory diseases emerges as important target for clinical applications. To date, stability of expanded Tregs depends on the purity of the starting population as there are currently no unambiguous markers to separate stable Tregs from Teffs after expansion. In this study, we present a Treg-specific activation signature that enables the identification of epigenetically stable antigen-activated Tregs not only ex vivo but also following prolonged in vitro activation of human Tregs, which provides the opportunity to identify and purify Tregs after prior expansion.In vitro generation of Tregs by large-scale expansion and/or genetic engineering remains a major challenge as there are currently no markers for the unambiguous identification of Tregs ex vivo or after prior in vitro culture. It has been proposed that naive Tregs represent a particularly stable Treg subset (62-66). Indeed, cord blood-derived CD25+ Tregs, consisting mainly of naive Tregs, were successfully expanded in vitro and have proven safety and efficacy in allogeneic umbilical cord blood transplantation (3) (4) (5) . However, limited availability of cord blood and low frequencies of naive Tregs in adult blood currently prevent their large-scale clinical application. Alternatively, expanded FACS-sorted CD25+CD127\u2212 Tregs have been used in autologous settings for treatment of autoimmunity (8, 12 ). Yet, FACS sorting is still not routinely applicable under GMP conditions, and even expansion of FACS-sorted CD25+CD127\u2212 Tregs fails to eliminate non-Treg contaminations (67, 68) . Clinical Treg isolation protocols are largely based on magnetic separation of CD25-expressing T cells (1, 4, 7, (69) (70) (71) . Although this enriches FoxP3+ Tregs ex vivo, purity is highly variable and depends on the composition of the starting material, i.e., cord blood, adult peripheral blood, or leukapheresis. Furthermore, non-Tregs can acquire a CD25+CD127\u2212 phenotype in vivo or upon in vitro culture and upregulate FoxP3 without acquisition of regulatory functions (72) (73) (74) (75) . Therefore, the lack of markers for the isolation of Tregs ex vivo as well as for their purification after prior expansion represents a significant technological challenge. Furthermore, the functional optimization of Tregs is hampered by the lack of Tregspecific activation markers, which allow discrimination between activated Tregs and activated Teffs to permit a direct evaluation of signals and pathways required for Tregs versus Teffs. Thus, the Treg-specific activation signature identified here provides a convenient tool to improve purity and function of human Tregs and to overcome a major hurdle for in vitro generation of functionally optimized Tregs for therapeutic applications.In this study, CD137+CD154\u2212 expression was shown to selectively identify epigenetically stable antigen-activated Tregs within in vitro expanded cultures. It has been shown that FoxP3 expression is unable to distinguish between Tregs and non-Tregs after prolonged in vitro expansion, whereas TSDR demethylation enabled unambiguous identification of suppressive Treg clones (76) . We show a striking linear correlation of CD137+CD154\u2212 expression with TSDR demethylation revealing the potential of this surface marker combination to identify epigenetically stable FoxP3+ Tregs. Treg instability has been observed upon in vitro expansion resulting in the loss of FoxP3 expression and acquisition of effector functions (62-65, 77) and also notable numbers of IFN-\u03b3-producing CD25+CD127\u2212 cells have been shown in patients suffering from MS (78), T1D (79), arthritis (80) (81) (82) , psoriasis (83), or inflammatory bowel disease (84) (85) (86) . Furthermore, studies from mice have shown that Treg plasticity contributes to anti-helminth immune responses (87) , but also to heighten chronic inflammation (81, 88, 89) and allergy (90) . Collectively, the contribution of Treg plasticity to immune responses and tolerance in humans remain to be determined in future studies, yet its potential to exaggerate immune pathologies represents a significant safety risk for adoptive transfer. Here, we show that plasticity including upregulation of effector functions and downregulation of FoxP3 as well as impaired suppressive capacities were restricted to CD154+ cells. With regard to their highly methylated TSDR, it can be assumed that CD137+CD154+ and CD137\u2212CD154+ (e-h) CAR-Tregs were restimulated for 6 h with bead-bound dextran and (e,g) FoxP3 expression (n = 6 from two independent experiments) and (e,F) CD137 and CD154 expression (n = 12 for from four independent experiments) were analyzed; (e) representative dot plot of one donor and (F,g) statistical summary of several donors. (h) Cytokine expression was analyzed on CD137-and CD154-expressing CAR-Tregs (n = 6 from two independent experiments). (a-c,F-h) Each dot represents one donor, and statistical significances were determined by (c) paired t-test or (h) Wilcoxon signed-rank test; lines indicate (a,B) median or (F-h) mean. (48, 93) . To account for the different kinetics of CD137 expression on Tregs and Teffs, it can be speculated that accessibility of the region is regulated by epigenetic modifications as CD137 has been shown to be hypomethylated in Tregs compared to Teffs (58) . Similarly, tnfrsf9 was almost completely demethylated in CD137+CD154\u2212 Tregs while cd40lg (CD154) was highly methylated providing a molecular basis for rapid CD137 upregulation and lack of CD154 expression on stable Tregs. The importance of CD137 as costimulator for T cell activation has been well established (94) , yet its role in Tregs remains elusive. CD137L is expressed on a variety of APCs and activated T cells and studies have shown that CD137-CD137L interaction increases Treg function (95-99) although impaired suppressive capacity has also been reported (100) . Therefore, the function of CD137 expression on human Tregs remains to be determined, yet its rapid upregulation on Tregs could provide a versatile and wide-ranging mechanism enabling regulatory interactions with various immune cells (101) . Redirecting Treg specificity by CARs is currently emerging as a promising approach for increased efficacy of therapeutic Tregs (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) . However, the generation of functional CAR-Tregs in vivo requires evaluation of their functionality in vitro, which is currently limited due to the lack of Treg-specific activation markers. LAP and GARP have been shown to be upregulated on Tregs after polyclonal (49, 51, 102, 103) or alloantigenspecific (50) stimulation, yet expression requires prolonged stimulation and does not necessarily correlate with FoxP3 expression (104) (105) (106) . Here, CD137 was shown to be upregulated selectively on FoxP3+ Tregs after 6-h stimulation, which enabled the rapid identification, isolation, and characterization of antigen-activated Tregs. To generate a controllable system for Treg activation, we redirected Treg specificity toward dextran as a model antigen. Dextran naturally exists in different sizes depending on the molecular weight and can be applied in different forms (e.g., soluble vs. bead-bound) providing a system for the rapid analysis of the effect of antigen binding on Treg activation. To date, little is known about the requirements of Treg activation via CAR stimulation, and individual CARs may differ in their specific requirements to optimally activate T cells (107) . It has been proposed that the extracellular spacer (53, (108) (109) (110) (111) (112) and the intracellular signaling domain (113) (114) (115) (116) (117) (118) (119) have a significant impact on the functionality of CAR-T cells. Activation-induced CD137 expression enabled the rapid comparison of different CAR constructs in their ability to activate Tregs revealing superiority of CD137 costimulation compared to commonly used CD28-CD3\u03b6 signaling. It has been shown that CD28, but not CD137 costimulation, can initiate tonic signaling in conventional T cells leading to an exhaustion phenotype and limited efficacy (107) . However, in that particular study, the degree of exhaustion varied between CARs with different scFv domains in spite of identical signaling domains. Therefore, it can be speculated that CD28 costimulation can be a potent inducer of T cell activation depending on the CAR. Nevertheless, it was shown here that CD137-CD3\u03b6 signaling was superior for in vitro CAR-Treg activation and expansion indicating potentially different signaling requirements than Tcon.In conclusion, we show CD137+CD154\u2212 expression to be a highly specific Treg activation signature that enabled the identification and isolation of stable Tregs even after prolonged in vitro culture. We also show that this short-term activation signature allowed rapid screening and optimization of CAR functionality in Tregs. Taken together, universal application of this Treg-spe cific activation signature will greatly improve Treg selection and functional optimization, such as for clinical applications in Tregbased therapies.", "citance": "It has been shown that CD28, but not CD137 costimulation, can initiate tonic signaling in conventional T cells leading to an exhaustion phenotype and limited efficacy (107) .", "claims": [{"text": "CD28 initiates tonic signaling in conventional T cells, which causes an exhaustion phenotype and limited efficiency.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Accordingly, most immunotherapies tested in the clinic to date have focused on reestablishing self-tolerance within the T cell compartment. Monoclonal antibodies (Ab) targeting a variety of lymphocyte surface proteins have demonstrated benefits in preclinical and clinical settings. Indeed, the use of Ab to target T cells directly or indirectly has proven to be an effective strategy to rapidly suppress \u03b2 cell autoimmunity and establish tissue-specific, long-term tolerance in rodent T1D models. In this review, we describe a number of these Ab-based immunotherapies, discuss associated immune regulatory mechanisms, and highlight results obtained in T1D clinical trials.", "citation_paragraph": "Treg relative to the placebo group (Orban et al. 2014) . A stable na\u00efve CD4 ? T cell pool, which serves as a source of diabetogenic Teff, is consistent with blockade of T cell activation. Interestingly, abatacept inhibits transmigration of central memory CD4? T cells across CD86-expressing microvascular endothelial cells in vitro (Lozanoska-Ochser et al. 2008) . Based on this observation it was suggested that the decrease in circulating central memory CD4? T cells in the abatacept group is due to altered trafficking properties, possibly reflecting retention of these T cells in the lymph nodes (Lozanoska-Ochser et al. 2008) . Notably, CD28 signals have recently been shown to regulate trafficking of murine autoreactive T cells into target tissues (Jain et al. 2013) . These findings suggest that abatacept-induced efficacy is in part achieved by delaying expansion of the pool of diabetogenic Teff. The decrease in Foxp3? Treg induced by abatacept further reflects the role for CD28 signaling in Foxp3? Treg survival and maintenance. Importantly, failure to establish an expanded or enhanced Foxp3? Treg pool likely hinders the duration and potency of the tolerogenic effect mediated by abatacept. Furthermore, targeting costimulatory molecules that regulate Teff and/or memory T cells (e.g., CD40L, 41BBL, OX40L, CD30L, CD70) (Chen and Flies 2013) may prove to be more effective at blocking b cell autoimmunity at late preclinical or clinical stages of T1D.

{"s2orc_id": 11714332, "title": "Inflammation-Related DNA Damage and Cancer Stem Cell Markers in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma", "abstract": "Nitrative and oxidative DNA damage plays an important role in inflammation-related carcinogenesis. To investigate the involvement of stem cells in Epstein-Barr virus infection-related nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), we used double immunofluorescence staining to examine several cancer stem/progenitor cell markers (CD44v6, CD24, and ALDH1A1) in NPC tissues and NPC cell lines. We also measured 8-nitroguanine formation as an indicator of inflammation-related DNA lesions. The staining intensity of 8-nitroguanine was significantly higher in cancer cells and inflammatory cells in the stroma of NPC tissues than in chronic nasopharyngitis tissues. Expression levels of CD44v6 and ALDH1A1 were significantly increased in cancer cells of primary NPC specimens in comparison to chronic nasopharyngitis tissues. Similarly, more intense staining of CD44v6 and ALDH1A1 was detected in an NPC cell line than in an immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelial cell line. In the case of CD24 staining, there was no significant difference between NPC and chronic nasopharyngitis tissues. 8-Nitroguanine was detected in both CD44v6- and ALDH1A1-positive stem cells in NPC tissues. In conclusion, CD44v6 and ALDH1A1 are candidate stem cell markers for NPC, and the increased formation of DNA lesions by inflammation may result in the mutation of stem cells, leading to tumor development in NPC.", "citation_paragraph": "Accumulating evidence in recent years strongly indicates that stem/progenitor cells are involved in inflammationmediated carcinogenesis [38, 39] . The present IHC analyses semiquantitatively confirmed that the expression levels of both CD44v6 and ALDH1A1 were increased in NPC tissues in comparison with chronic nasopharyngitis tissues. Western blot analysis confirmed that CD44v6 and ALDH1A1 were highly expressed in an NPC cell line compared with a normal nasopharyngeal epithelial cell line. Double immunostaining of CD44v6 and ALDH1A1 was occasionally observed in cancer nest cells and the NPC cell line. Todaro et al. reported that CD44v6 was a marker of constitutive and reprogrammed cancer stem cells driving cancer metastasis [22] . Hou et al. indicated that increased expression of ALDH1A1 in NPC was associated with enhanced invasiveness [34] . These reports and our data led us to hypothesize that NPC may be a disease which is related with stem/progenitor cells.It is assumed that chronic inflammation, such as that observed in chronic nasopharyngitis, can be an etiological factor of human cancers. Inflammation-induced tissue injury activates stem/progenitor cells, and these cells are damaged under ROS/RNS-rich environment. Mutated stem/progenitor cells would proliferate leading to cancer development. Our previous reports also confirmed that DNA damage, including 8-nitroguanine formation, could be used as a biomarker to evaluate the risk of EBV-mediated NPC [14, 40] . The present study revealed that the stem/progenitor markers CD44v6 and ALDH1A1 were positively stained in the NPC cases. We demonstrated that the amount of 8-nitroguanine in CD44v6-or ALDH1A1-positive tissues was significantly higher in NPC than in inflammatory tissues. 8-Nitroguanine, like 8-oxodG, is known to cause G:C to T:A transversions [41] . In our previous studies we proposed a mechanism for the generation of cancer stem cells by inflammation [3, 42, 43] . Interestingly, the nuclear localization of COX-2 was significantly associated with the upregulation of CD44v6 in sporadic bladder cancer tissues [42] , suggesting that the stemness marker has some relation with inflammation. Our present results indicate that CD44v6-and/or ALDH1A1-positive cells are damaged under nitrative stress, and accumulation of mutagenic DNA lesions may play a role in NPC carcinogenesis.The present study revealed that moderate immunofluorescence staining of ALDH1A1 was observed in chronic 65% of the total number of cells in the NPC cell line. The cancer stem cell population consists of a very small fraction of the total population that simultaneously expresses a set of defined markers [44] . The present results showed that a small number of cells had both CD44v6 and ALDH1A1 immunoreactivity. Expression of CD44v6 and CD24 in NPC biopsy samples in endemic area was higher than NPC array samples in nonendemic area. Interestingly, in the Chinese that have migrated to North America, the incidence of NPC was reduced but still higher than in the background population [6] . Environmental factors may have some effects on virus activation resulting in the difference of CD44v6 and CD24 expression between two groups. Relevantly, several studies demonstrated that CD44v6 expression was increased as human papillomavirus-associated cervical carcinoma progressed to more advanced clinical stages [45] , and serum levels of CD44v6 were increased in patients with human immunodeficiency virus-related non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [46] . CD24 polymorphism is associated with viral clearance and risk for chronic hepatitis virus infection [47, 48] . In the present study, double immunofluorescence staining of these stem/progenitor cell markers showed that a small number of cells coexpressed CD44v6 and ALDH1A1, which may be indicators of cancer stem cells in NPC.Our data indicated that 8-nitroguanine was formed in CD44v6-and/or ALDH1A1-positive stem cells in NPC tissues, suggesting that inflammation may increase the number of mutant stem cells that participate in NPC development. The present study shows that cancer cells are the progeny of cancer stem cells and become polyclonal due to irregular progenitor cell differentiation caused by alteration of genes involved in cell differentiation. Therefore, NPC may be a disease of stem/progenitor cells that can be detected by the formation of 8-nitroguanine in combination with increased expression of stem/progenitor markers. Understanding of molecular markers of cancer stem cells in NPC can improve the development of clinical strategies, as seen in inhibition of tumor growth by interference with CD44v6 signaling [49] and a specific ALDH1A1 inhibitor for cancer stem cell target therapy [50] . In addition, higher serum CD44v6 levels in lung cancer [51] and joint detection of CD44v6 and CD62P in NPC peripheral blood were found to be significantly unfavorable prognostic factors. Therefore, further studies are needed to apply cancer stem cell markers for therapeutic targets and biomarkers in NPC.", "citance": "Todaro et al. reported that CD44v6 was a marker of constitutive and reprogrammed cancer stem cells driving cancer metastasis [22] .", "claims": [{"text": "CD44v6 is a marker of constitutive and reprogrammed cancer stem cells driving cancer metastasis.

{"s2orc_id": 22507861, "title": "Pattern of retinoblastoma pathway inactivation dictates response to CDK4/6 inhibition in GBM.", "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a fatal primary brain tumor harboring myriad genetic and epigenetic alterations. The recent multidimensional analysis of the GBM genome has provided a more complete view of the landscape of such alterations and their linked pathways. This effort has demonstrated that certain pathways are universally altered, but that the specific genetic events altered within each pathway can vary for each particular patient's tumor. With this atlas of genetic and epigenetic events, it now becomes feasible to assess how the patterns of mutations in a pathway influence response to drugs that are targeting such pathways. This issue is particularly important for GBM because, in contrast to other tumor types, molecularly targeted therapies have failed to alter overall survival substantially. Here, we combined functional genetic screens and comprehensive genomic analyses to identify CDK6 as a GBM oncogene that is required for proliferation and viability in a subset of GBM cell lines and tumors. Using an available small molecule targeting cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 4 and 6, we sought to determine if the specific pattern of retinoblastoma pathway inactivation dictated the response to CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy. We showed that codeletion of CDKN2A and CDKN2C serves as a strong predictor of sensitivity to a selective inhibitor of CDK4/6. Thus, genome-informed drug sensitivity studies identify a subset of GBMs likely to respond to CDK4/6 inhibition. More generally, these observations demonstrate that the integration of genomic, functional and pharmacologic data can be exploited to inform the development of targeted therapy directed against specific cancer pathways.", "citation_paragraph": "Integrated Functional Genomics Identifies CDK6 as a GBM Oncogene.To identify genes required for the viability of GBM cells, we performed an RNAi-mediated, loss-of-function screen in two GBM cell lines, LN-229 and U87MG. Using a lentivirally delivered shRNA library composed of 4,849 shRNAs targeting 1,002 genes (Dataset S1A), including nearly all human kinases (5), we assessed which of these shRNAs induced alterations in cell proliferation and viability (hereafter designated viability) using a luminometric assay. B scores corresponding to relative viability conferred by individual shRNAs were plotted in a distribution curve for each cell line (Fig. 1A) , where a B score of 0 represents average viability, positive B scores correlate with increased viability, and negative B scores indicate reduced viability. We considered genes targeted by at least one shRNA with a B score lower than \u22121.5 and one additional shRNA lower than \u22121.0 as potential candidates. From the U87MG cell line, 122 genes emerged as candidates, whereas 150 genes scored in LN-229 (Fig. 1B) . To minimize cell line-specific artifacts, we considered only those hits that scored in both cell lines, producing a list of 62 candidate GBM viability genes (Dataset S1B).Next, we triangulated these viability hits with genomic data from array-CGH profiles of 317 primary GBM tumors by TCGA (2) . As copy number gain is a common mechanism that leads to activation of oncogenes, we determined which of the 62 candidates resided within regions of genomic gain with use of the segment gain or loss (SGOL) algorithm (Materials and Methods). Eight of the 62 candidates (CDK6, WNK3, BTK, ADCK2, HGF, LOC402679, TRPV6, and KDR) ranked among the top tenth percentile ( Fig. 1B and Dataset S1C) and were thus considered candidates required for GBM cell viability and targeted for genomic amplification in human GBM.Of these eight candidates, we focused on CDK6 because it was the top-ranking viability gene by SGOL analysis and is a known core component of the RB pathway (2) . Moreover, as the primary binding partner, CDK6 showed impaired binding to loss-offunction variants of p18 INK4C , a backup tumor suppressor codeleted with closely related CDK inhibitors p16INKA and p15 INK4B in human GBM (6, 7) . Here, we first validated that multiple shRNAs used in the viability screen were effective in extinguishing CDK6 expression on the protein level. Using LN-229 cells, we showed that three independent CDK6-targeting shRNAs-sh374, sh696, and sh720-that scored with significant B values in the initial viability screen were indeed effective in depleting CDK6 protein levels (Fig. 1C) .Next, we stably expressed GFP, V5-epitope-tagged CDK6 or CDK4 in primary nontransformed murine p16Ink4a /Arf-null astrocytes (8) at passage 13. Upon confirming expression of ectopic CDK4 or CDK6 by immunoblotting ( Fig. 2A) , we found that CDK6-expressing astrocytes, like the CDK4-expressing cells, exhibited enhanced proliferation relative to the control (Fig. 2B) . In anchorage-independent growth assays, both CDK4 and CDK6 led to efficient transformation of p16 Ink4a /Arf-null astrocytes (GFP, 37 \u00b1 2 vs. CDK4, 1,031 \u00b1 24 vs. CDK6, 877 \u00b1 91; P < 0.00021; Fig. 2C ). In vivo, GFP-expressing astrocytes were unable to form tumors s.c. In contrast, CDK6 expression conferred tumorigenicity in 57% of the injection sites with an average latency of 115 d, whereas CDK4 expression resulted in 100% penetrance with an average latency of 64 d (Fig. 2D) . Taken together, we conclude that, like the classical GBM oncogene CDK4 (9), CDK6 also serves as a bona fide oncogene and represents a potential therapeutic target in GBM.Sensitivity to CDK4/6 Inhibition Is Influenced by RB Pathway Inactivation Pattern. As a specific CDK4/CDK6 inhibitor PD0332991 is under development (10), we explored the therapeutic potential of CDK4/ 6 inhibition in GBM. Here, we subjected a panel of 25 glioma cell lines to treatment with PD0332991. Briefly, cells were exposed to varying concentrations of PD0332991 for 5 d and then assayed for cell number by ATP measurement, reflecting cell proliferation and/ or viability (Fig. S1) . IC 50 values for individual cell lines were determined (Dataset S2).Contrary to our expectation that cell lines expressing high levels of CDK4 or CDK6 would be sensitive to PD0332991, the response to this inhibitor failed to correlate with the level of CDK6 or CDK4 expression (Fig. S2) . Instead, of the seven sensitive cell lines [i.e., IC 50 <1 \u03bcM, a dosage at which specific activity against CDK4/6 has been demonstrated (10)], five harbored codeletion of CDKN2A/B and CDKN2C (Dataset S2). Indeed, five of the nine cell lines with codeletion of CDKN2A/B and CDKN2C were sensitive, whereas only two of nine CDKN2A/B-deleted cell lines were susceptible (P = 0.073). In contrast, six of nine CDKN2A/B-deleted cell lines were highly resistant, exhibiting IC 50 values greater than 4 \u03bcM, a level at which PD0332991 is known to affect other targets (10) .To show this differential sensitivity among cell lines with distinct patterns of RB pathway inactivation, we plotted the median IC 50 s for GBM cells with each pattern in Fig. 3A . As shown, only the CDKN2A/C-codeleted cells were enriched for responders (median IC 50 value, 0.6 \u03bcM). Interesting, cell lines with mutation or deletion of RB1 itself, or cell lines without evidence of alterations in any of these RB pathway core components (Fig. S2) , were highly resistant, all with IC 50 values greater than 4 \u03bcM. This sensitivity pattern to pharmacological inhibition is recapitulated with genetic inhibition by RNAi, as CDKN2A/C-codeleted cell lines were sensitive to RNAi-mediated depletion of either CDK6 or CDK4 (Fig. S3 and Dataset S3), whereas RB-null or mutant cell lines and cell lines without apparent RB pathway alterations were unaffected by RNAi targeting CDK4 or CDK6.On the mechanistic level, PD0332991 induced near-complete and lasting G1 arrest in sensitive cell lines (Fig. S4A and Dataset S4), in conjunction with a greatly reduced level of phosphorylated RB protein (Fig. S4B) . G1 arrest was less complete in LN-18, a cell line with intermediate sensitivity to PD0332991, and nonexistent in two resistant cell lines (Dataset S4). Long-term exposure to PD0332991 (14 d at 1 \u03bcM) induced quantitative senescence in several CDKN2A/B/C-deleted cell lines with minimal residual colony formation (Fig. 3B) whereas resistant cell lines from other RB alteration patterns failed to undergo senescence and quickly became resistant to PD0332991. Taken together, these data suggest that a specific pattern of RB pathway alteration strongly correlates with sensitivity to pharmacological inhibition of CDK4/6 in GBM cell lines.Pattern of RB Pathway Deregulation in Human GBM. As a subset of GBM cells can undergo growth arrest and induction of senescence in response to pharmacological inhibition of CDK4/6, and such responders are enriched among cell lines with codeletion of the CDKN2A/B and CDKN2C loci, we next sought to determine whether similar patterns of RB pathway deregulation are observed in human GBM tumors. Here, we compiled a comprehensive overview of core and extended components of the RB pathway based on multidimensional genomic data from 317 primary GBM tumor samples characterized by TCGA. In particular, copy number loss, promoter methylation, or mutation of CDKN2A, CDKN2B, CDKN2C, CDKN2D, CDKN1A, CDKN1B, RB, RBL1, or RBL2 as well as copy number gain or mutation of CCND1, CCND2, CCND3, CCNE1, CCNE2, CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, E2F1, E2F2, E2F3, or E2F6 were considered RB pathway-compromising events ( Fig. 4 ; see Materials and Methods for parameters).Besides a subset of primary GBMs (43 of 317; 14%) with no detectable RB pathway-compromising alterations (hereafter classified as \"no alteration\"), the majority of the remaining 274 tumors harbor multiple RB pathway compromising lesions (average, 3.02 \u00b1 1.42 events). Tumors with RB deletion (7 of 317; 2.2%) and RB mutation (15 of 317; 5%) are collectively grouped into the \"RB-del/mut alteration class\" (7.2%) regardless of presence or absence of other RB pathway events. As reported in the literature, deletion or loss of CDKN2A is found in 63% of all GBM (n = 201 of 317 tumors), making it the most frequent RB pathway alteration in primary GBM, similar to what we observed in glioma cell lines. In contrast, methylation of the CDKN2A promoter (in 1 of 150 specimens with promotion methylation data) or CDKN2A mutations (in 3 of 91 samples with mutation data; 3%) are relatively rare events. As observed among the cell lines, codeletion/loss of CDKN2A and CDKN2C occur in 6.3% of the cases (n = 20 of 317), whereas CDK6 gain in combination with CDKN2A loss is observed in 31% of the cases (n = 98 of 317). In contrast, amplification of the CDK4 gene is found in 41 of 317 tumors (13%) and appear to define a distinct subgroup having minimal overlap with the CDKN2A-deleted subgroup [4 of 160 tumors with log 2 (CDKN2A) less than 1 have concomitantly amplified CDK4]. In summary, analysis of the copy number profiles in TCGA GBM samples showed that 6% of all primary GBMs harbor codeletion/loss of CDKN2A and CDKN2C, representing a subset of GBM predicted to be especially sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibition based on our study in GBM cell lines.", "citance": "Moreover, as the primary binding partner, CDK6 showed impaired binding to loss-offunction variants of p18 INK4C , a backup tumor suppressor codeleted with closely related CDK inhibitors p16INKA and p15 INK4B in human GBM (6, 7) .", "claims": [{"text": "CDK6 shows impaired binding to loss-of-function variants of p18 INK4C.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "CDK6 shows improved binding to loss-of-function variants of p18 INK4C.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}
{"s2orc_id": 48363663, "title": "Molecular Genetics of Frontotemporal Dementia Elucidated by Drosophila Models\u2014Defects in Endosomal\u2013Lysosomal Pathway", "abstract": "Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the second most common senile neurodegenerative disease. FTD is a heterogeneous disease that can be classified into several subtypes. A mutation in CHMP2B locus (CHMP2Bintron5), which encodes a component of endosomal sorting complex required for transport-III (ESCRT-III), is associated with a rare hereditary subtype of FTD linked to chromosome 3 (FTD-3). ESCRT is involved in critical cellular processes such as multivesicular body (MVB) formation during endosomal\u207blysosomal pathway and autophagy. ESCRT mutants causes diverse physiological defects primarily due to accumulation of endosomes and defective MVBs resulting in misregulation of signaling pathways. Charged multivesicular body protein 2B (CHMP2B) is important for neuronal physiology which especially rely on precise regulation of protein homeostasis due to their post-mitotic status. Drosophila has proven to be an excellent model for charaterization of mechanistic underpinning of neurodegenerative disorders including FTD. In this review, current understanding of various FTD-related mutations is discussed with a focus on Drosophila models of CHMP2Bintron5-associated FTD.", "citation_paragraph": "At the molecular level, the G-C mutation in the CHMP2B transcript causes the inclusion of the 201-bp intron 5, which results in addition of a valine residue followed by a stop codon. Hence, CHMP2B intron5 features a C-terminus truncation, with the last 36 amino acids replaced by a valine [7] . The truncated part of C-terminal region contains the MIM domain, which is responsible for Vps4 recruitment, so CHMP2B intron5 cannot interact with Vps4 [60] . As a result, the membrane scission function of ESCRT is impaired, and therefore the MVB pathway and the autophagy pathway are disrupted. Also, since the C-terminal domain is essential to the autoinhibition of CHMP2B, the mutant protein is constitutively active, resulting in polymerization that deform the membrane [60] .Disruption of the endosomal-lysosomal pathway by CHMP2B intron5 primarily causes misregulation of receptor turnover. The impaired degradation of receptors results in upregulation of receptor-mediated signaling pathways. Because of the relative ease of ectopic expression of genes with control over spatio-temporal attributes and the capacity to conduct genetic screens, studies using the Drosophila model of CHMP2B intron5 have led to the identification of multiple misregulated receptor-mediated signaling. Ectopic expression of CHMP2B intron5 primarily during photoreceptor cell diffrentiation in the Drosophila eye imaginal disc resulted in excessive melanization in the eyes due to upregulation of Toll receptor-mediated signaling, a conserved pathway of innate immune response [84] . Additionally, ectopic expression of CHMP2B intron5 during eye tissue specification during larval stages caused tumorigenic deformities in the adults eyes due to upregulation of Notch pathway-a fundamental cellular interaction pathway involved in cell fate determination and differentiation during development [85] . Furthermore, Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), Rab8 signaling are upregulated when CHMP2B intron5 is expressed in Drosophila neuromuscular junctions (NMJ). The resulting synaptic overgrowth at the NMJ synapse is a distinct feature of neurodegeneration [41] . Recently, the pro-apoptotic protein POSH/SH3RF1 was shown to mediate the JNK and NF-\u03baB dependent apoptosis in CHMP2B intron5 -mediated toxicity in Drosophila NMJ [86] .ESCRT machinery also plays a role in autophagosome formation. Therefore, CHMP2B intron5 also induces defects in autophagy. Recent genetic interaction evidence suggests that the mutant protein inhibits phagophore maturation through Syntaxin 13 [81] . Ectopic expression of CHMP2B intron5 was shown to cause accumulation of autophagosomes, which contained aggregates of ubiquinated proteins [87, 88] .Although the Drosophila model provides major advantages in identification and characterization of genetic modifiers and pathological mechanisms of mutations associated with FTD, alternative models e.g., knock out and trangenic mice, primary neuronal culture, and neuronal culture derived from induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) and Human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines have significantly contributed in understanding to further progress discoveries in these areas [19] . When expressed in mouse neurons, CHMP2B intron5 was shown to cause behavioral and histological features of FTD and ALS. In particular, CHMP2B intron5 mouse exhibited behavioral deficits as well as progressive loss of motor activities [89] . On the cellular level, CHMP2B intron5 effects dendrites by inducing decrease in spine density and reduction in mushroom spine morphology [6] . In mouse models, in addition to ubiquinated protein aggregation, CHMP2B intron5 also induces gliosis and axonal swelling [90] . Recently, using cortical mouse neurons Transmembrane protein 106B (TMEM106B) was identified as a modifier of CHMP2B intron5 toxicity through the autophagy pathway [23] . This research identified an association between TMEM106B and CHMP2B, particularly the localization of TMEM106B variants in Rab5 and Rab7 positive endosomes, suggesting possible engagement of ESCRT pathways [23] .CHMP2B intron5 transfected cell lines showed reduced fusion of endosomes with lysosomes and delayed degradation of Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) and EGFR [91] . Human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived postmitotic neurons were used to show the functions of ESCRT-III subunit Snf7-1 and Snf7-2, which play key roles in the neurotoxicity of CHMP2B intron5 [92] . A human-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line with the CHMP2B intron5 mutation was also generated recently using the CRISPR-Cas9 system [93] .

Results from these screens have led to the identification of new components of these processes and, importantly, have also provided insights into the complexity of biological systems, forcing new and innovative approaches to understanding functional networks in cells.

Recently, Ars2 (for arsenite resistance gene 2) was identified as a key component required for viral immunity in Drosophila cells (177) . A modified influenza virus that can infect Drosophila cells was similarly used in a full-genome study to look at the influenza life cycle in host cells, and an extension of the results to human cells demonstrated the relevance of results with human homologs of several genes identified in the screen, including ATP6V0D1, COX6A1, and NXF1 (178) . Relevance to both human cells and a dipteran mosquito vector of human dengue virus (DENV), Aedes aegypti, was demonstrated after a full-genome screen with a DENV in Drosophila cells; specifically, 42 of the 82 genes identified in the Drosophila screen for which human homologs could be identified also acted as host factors for DENV in human cells (37) . Additional studies have implicated the COPI coatmer in both viral replication and lipid homeostatis (82, 179) .

In this review, we will assess the current advances in the relationship between caloric restriction, a proven anti-aging intervention, and epigenetic signatures of aging. We will specifically discuss the impact of caloric restriction on epigenetic regulation and how some of the favorable effects of caloric restriction on lifespan and healthspan could be mediated by epigenetic modifications.", "citation_paragraph": "During the last six years, there has been tremendous interest in a novel class of biomarkers of aging, called epigenetic clocks. These models, among which Horvath's [79] and Hannum's clocks [80] are the most popular ones, combine DNAm values in selected sets of CpG sites in order to predict one individual's age. Epigenetic clocks are nowadays considered as robust measures of chronological age in humans [81] [82] [83] but they also appear to be reflective of the biological age of individuals. They can reflect age acceleration associated with the genetic background such as progeroid syndromes [84, 85] , and deviation of epigenetic age from chronological age (also called epigenetic age acceleration) has been shown to be predictive of important health outcomes such as all-cause mortality or frailty [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] [91] . Several lines of recent evidence suggest additionally that epigenetic age predictors can be influenced by lifestyle factors and exposures, such as obesity [92] [93] [94] , stress [95] [96] [97] , or pollution [98] , but also by nutritional factors. In 2016, Quach et al. were the firsts to investigate the relationships between measures of epigenetic age acceleration and dietary factors [94] . They detected a significant correlation between epigenetic age acceleration measures and fish intake, poultry intake, as well as blood carotenoid levels used as a surrogate of fruit and vegetable consumption [94] . Recently, Levine et al. developed a new powerful biomarker of aging, replacing prediction of chronological age with prediction of a surrogate measure of \"phenotypic age\" based on several clinical measures [99] . This model, named DNAm PhenoAge, is also related to dietary habits, as indicators of fruits and vegetables consumption are associated with lower values of epigenetic age. Collectively, the results of these two studies suggest that epigenetic clocks are able to grasp the potential health benefits associated with the consumption of higher levels of fruits and vegetables, fish, and poultry [94, 99] .While studies on the effect of CR on epigenetic clocks in humans are missing, important work has been recently carried out in animal models regarding this question. Indeed, epigenetic clocks have been developed in animal species other than humans, especially in mice and rats [25, 46, [100] [101] [102] [103] [104] [105] . These models are of particular interest because rodents are well-known mammalian models of aging and have the potential to provide new insights on the relationships between DNAm biomarkers and interventions (genetic, dietary, or pharmacological) which are intended to increase the lifespan and cannot be easily performed in humans. So far, to our knowledge, six publications have developed epigenetic clock models for rodents: three multi-tissue [100] [101] [102] , two blood-based [25, 103] , and one liver-based clock [46] (Table 2 ). With every model, except for the one recently developed by Meer et al. [101] , animals treated with CR were significantly younger regarding their epigenetic age compared to their untreated counterparts [25, 46, 102, 103] . For example, CR was able to reduce epigenetic ages of 9.4 months on average in mice livers [46] or of 20% in whole-blood [103] . In Stubbs' model, the liver predicted epigenetic age was strongly dependent on diet: mice fed with a high-fat diet showed accelerated epigenetic aging, and this phenomenon was even more marked if their mothers were fed with a low-fat diet, underlying the inter-generational effect of DNA methylation [100] . Finally, in the study of Maegawa et al., an epigenetic clock model was also developed for rhesus monkeys: here again, CR was associated with significantly lower methylation age, though the effect was less pronounced than in mice [25] .

Although these studies added to the body of evidence suggesting that increased preoperative CRP levels predict increased postoperative mortality, their limitations significantly affected generalizability of their results. Our study assessed the value of preoperative CRP for predicting postoperative all-cause mortality in a relatively homogeneous patient population undergoing elective, CABG only surgery, and suggests that preoperative CRP is a significant discriminant of postoperative death. It is worth noting, though, that in a large prospective study, the addition of biomarkers, among them CRP, to the preoperative risk prediction model did not significantly improve the prediction of mortality over patient and disease characteristics alone [21] . In that study, the investigators concluded that the added measurement of biomarkers outside of preoperative risk factors would be an unnecessary use of health care resources with little added benefit for predicting inhospital mortality.Although preoperative measurement of CRP may offer a refinement in the risk stratification of patients who present for surgical coronary revascularization, the therapeutic strategies directed at elevated CRP in this setting are still unclear.

Plant IDPs play critical roles in plant biology and often act as integrators of signals from multiple plant regulatory and environmental inputs. Binding promiscuity and plasticity allow IDPs to interact with multiple partners in protein interaction networks and provide important functional advantages in molecular recognition through transient protein-protein interactions. Short interaction-prone segments within IDPs, termed molecular recognition features, represent potential binding sites that can undergo disorder-to-order transition upon binding to their partners. In this review, we summarize the evidence for the importance of IDPs in plant biology and evaluate the functions associated with intrinsic disorder in five different types of plant protein families experimentally confirmed as IDPs. Functional studies of these proteins illustrate the broad impact of disorder on many areas of plant biology, including abiotic stress, transcriptional regulation, light perception, and development. Based on the roles of disorder in the protein-protein interactions, we propose various modes of action for plant IDPs that may provide insight for future experimental approaches aimed at understanding the molecular basis of protein function within important plant pathways.", "citation_paragraph": "Cryptochromes (CRYs) represent another example of intrinsic disorder playing an essential role in plant signaling. Found in plants, animals, and bacteria, CRYs have an N-terminal domain sharing sequence similarity to photolyases. CRYs are flavoproteins that catalyze the repair of UV light-damaged DNA but do not have photolyase activity (Sancar, 2003) . Both plant and animal CRYs possess a variable C-terminal domain, ranging from 30 to 250 amino acids beyond their photolyase homology regions (PHRs; ;500 amino acids) and mediate light signal transduction (Cashmore, 2003) . Despite their diverse functions, photolyases and CRYs preserve a common structural fold in their PHRs as well as having a similar dependence on flavin adenine dinucleotide and, therefore, a similar light-driven intramolecular electron transfer mechanism to initiate signaling (Zoltowski et al., 2011) . The signaling mechanisms of CRYs are often related to specific protein-protein interactions between CRYs and their associated effectors ( Figure 2D ).Arabidopsis CRYs (CRY1 and CRY2) interact with phytochromes in the regulation of photomorphogenic development and floral initiation and in the molecular circuitry of the circadian clock (Li and Yang, 2007) . CRYs also regulate inhibition of hypocotyl growth and induction of flowering in response to blue light through the lightdependent inhibition of COP1, which results in accumulation of TFs to initiate the photomorphogenic program (Lin and Shalitin, 2003) . Furthermore, At-CRYs act together with the blue light receptor phototropins to mediate blue light regulation of stomatal opening (Li and Yang, 2007) , which is also regulated by the interaction between CRYs and COP1, a repressor of stomatal opening (Mao et al., 2005) . Yeast two-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation studies have shown that CRYs interact directly with COP1 through the C-terminal domain of the CRYs in a light-independent manner (Wang et al., 2001; Yang et al., 2001) . Inhibition of COP1 function was achieved by regulating the conformation or accessibility of the C-terminal domain to COP1 in a light-dependent manner (Yang et al., 2000) , suggesting that the signaling mechanism of CRYs is driven by a light-dependent conformational rearrangement in the C-terminal domain. In an analogous animal system, the Drosophila melanogaster cryptochrome (dCRY) regulates the circadian clock by targeting the TIMELESS protein (TIM) for ubiquitin-mediated degradation in the presence of light (Koh et al., 2006) . Again, the C-terminal domain of dCRY is essential for light-dependent interaction between dCRY and TIM, whereas dCRY with its C-terminal domain removed exhibits lightindependent interaction with TIM, indicating that a lightmodulated interaction between the C-terminal domain and the PHR of dCRY is critical for proper regulation of the circadian clock (Busza et al., 2004; Dissel et al., 2004) .The recombinant C-terminal domains from both animal and plant CRYs have been experimentally demonstrated to be intrinsically disordered in solution (Partch et al., 2005) . These C-terminal domains interact directly with their PHRs, inducing stable tertiary structure in the C-terminal domains. Upon light exposure, a lightdependent structural rearrangement occurs in the latter part of the C-terminal domain of At-CRY1 that may subsequently be accessible and bind to COP1, resulting in the inhibition of COP1 function. This provides experimental evidence that intrinsic disorder can be involved in signaling mechanisms of the CRYs in response to light (Partch et al., 2005) . In further support of this lightdependent conformational change of the disordered C-terminal domain, time-resolved protein conformational changes in fulllength At-CRY1 reveal that light-dependent modulation of the interaction between the PHR and the C-terminal domain is critical for At-CRYs to transform a blue light signal into proteinprotein interactions and for the subsequent biological activity of At-CRY1 (Kondoh et al., 2011) . In darkness, the PHR and the C-terminal domain form a metastable tertiary structure by interdomain interaction. A conformational change in full-length At-CRY1 is dependent on light activation of the PHR through flavin reduction by intraprotein electron transfer. This conformational switch triggers the dissociation of the C-terminal domain from the PHR in full-length At-CRY1. Subsequently, this dissociation leads to exposure of the previously buried interfaces in both the PHR and the C-terminal domain. These newly exposed segments act as binding sites for other molecules or effectors, thereby activating signals in the photomorphogenic pathways (Kondoh et al., 2011) . These proposed signaling mechanisms of CRYs are further supported by the crystal structure of full-length dCRY (Zoltowski et al., 2011) . Compared with the long C-terminal domain of At-CRY1 (;200 amino acids), dCRY has a shorter C-terminal domain (;40 amino acids) that is loosely folded and packed against the PHR in its crystallized state. Most of the residues in the C-terminal domain of dCRY take turn and loop conformations with a helical tail formed by the last 10 residues. The C-terminal helical tail docks in the analogous groove that binds DNA substrates in the Drosophila photolyase. Importantly, the light-driven electron transfer in the PHR results in a reduced conformation of flavin adenine dinucleotide, which subsequently influences the extensive interactions between the binding pocket in dCRY and the C-terminal residues. In fact, two independent dCRY molecules in a crystallographic asymmetric unit within the crystal of full-length dCRY display significant variation in binding mode of the helical tail, reflecting the structural flexibility of the C-terminal domain, which is loosely bound in the crystal structure.The C-terminal domains of CRYs use their intrinsic disorder nature to assure their binding promiscuity and plasticity, which are required for efficient recognition of multiple partners and provide diverse binding sites for different partners ( Figure 2D ). Similar to other IDPs discussed in this article, we propose that the disordered C-terminal domains of CRYs may carry out bindinginduced folding to make high-specificity/low-affinity reversible interactions with various partners; in darkness, they may fold in a way that allows binding to the PHRs and upon light exposure be released and fold in another way to bind to various effectors, such as COP1. Disorder predictions on a set of animal and plant CRYs have shown some short and rigid segments distributed within the disordered C-terminal domains of most of CRYs analyzed (Partch et al., 2005) . These short rigid segments constitute potential MoRFs acting as nucleation sites for binding-induced folding. Among them, a potential a-MoRF corresponding to a short and rigid segment (residues 530 to 540) in the C-terminal domain of full-length dCRY has been verified to fold as an a-helix in binding to its PHR domain (Zoltowski et al., 2011) . Interestingly, it seems likely that the different lengths of the C-terminal domains of AtCRYs and dCRY render them capable of regulating their signaling differently. At-CRYs appear to use their longer C-terminal domains to interact directly with COP1 (Wang et al., 2001; Yang et al., 2001) or other effectors, though it cannot be excluded that other molecules may bind to the active site of the PHRs 10 of 17The Plant Cell Figure 3A, I ) Ts-DHN-1 and -2 undergo disorder-to-order transition upon binding to zinc ion to form mainly b-strand.", "citance": "Both plant and animal CRYs possess a variable C-terminal domain, ranging from 30 to 250 amino acids beyond their photolyase homology regions (PHRs; ;500 amino acids) and mediate light signal transduction (Cashmore, 2003) .", "claims": [{"text": "CRY proteins have variable C-terminal domains.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "CRY proteins mediate light signal transduction.

The TNF receptor superfamily (TNFRSF) member GITR is important for CD4+ T cell accumulation and control of chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). We found that type I interferon (IFN\u2010I) induced TNFSF ligands GITRL, 4\u20131BBL, OX40L, and CD70 predominantly on monocyte\u2010derived APCs and CD80 and CD86 predominantly on classical dendritic cells (cDCs).

GITR signals in CD4+ T cells occurred after priming to upregulate OX40, CD25, and chemokine receptor CX3CR1.

Thus the finding that GITR regulated CD25 is consistent with the requirement for IL-2 for CD4 + and CD8 + T cell expansion in the early stages of LCMV13 infection, and suggests that GITR contributes to the IL-2 response in the CD4 + T cells. IL-7 is important for maintaining naive and memory T cells (Schluns and Lefran\u00e7 ois, 2003) . Although IL-7R is normally downregulated on effector T cells (Schluns and Lefran\u00e7 ois, 2003) , it can nonetheless play a critical role in the outcome of LCMV13 infection (Nanjappa et al., 2011; Pellegrini et al., 2011) . Thus the finding that Tnfrsf18 \u00c0/\u00c0 T cells downregulated IL-7Ra more than Tnfrsf18+/+T cells may be of significance to T cell numbers and viral control. CX3CR1 was more highly upregulated on Tnfrsf18+/+compared to Tnfrsf18 \u00c0/\u00c0 CD4 + T cells at day 3 p.i. CX3CR1, the receptor for fractalkine, is associated not only with migration but also with anti-apoptotic signaling (Gautier et al., 2009; White and Greaves, 2012) . CX3CR1 is also a marker of CD8 + effector T cells (B\u00f6 ttcher et al., 2015) . CX3CR1 levels on CD8 + T cells are associated with distinct migratory properties: CX3CR1 hi CD8 + T cells patrol the vasculature, whereas CX3CR1 int CD8 + T cells enter the tissues (Gerlach et al., 2016) . CX3CR1 on Th2 cells promotes T cell survival and airway inflammation (Mionnet et al., 2010) . We also noted another monocyte marker, Ly6C, upregulated by GITR stimulation on CD4 + T cells. Of note, a Ly6C + population of CD4 + T cells is protective against Leishmania reinfection (Peters et al., 2014). Here we found that the Ly6C + Cx3CR1 + population represents the majority of Tnfrsf18 +/+ CD4 + SMARTA T cells at day 3 post-LCMV13 infection, whereas it is a minor proportion within its Tnfrsf18 \u00c0/\u00c0 counterpart. CX3CR1 expression on the T cells may facilitate T cell survival or colocalization with cells expressing membrane fractalkine, potentially allowing CD4 + T cells to provide help to the CD8 + T cells, although this remains to be investigated.Signals 1 and 2 (the peptide-MHC complex and the B7 family costimulatory signal, respectively) are critical for T cell priming (Schwartz, 1992) . A third signal, provided by cytokines such as IL-12 or IFN-I, provides an important signal 3 for T cell activation (Curtsinger and Mescher, 2010) . Here we have shown that the signal 3 cytokine IFN-I, through its differential effects on cDCs versus inflammatory APCs, sets up a dichotomy whereby the TNF family ligands are preferentially induced on the monocytederived inflammatory APCs to provide a post-priming survival checkpoint (signal 4) for T cell activation.

However, only few data are available focusing on the first seconds and minutes of Ca2+ microdomain formation and related signaling pathways in activated T-lymphocytes. In this review, we condense current knowledge on Ca2+ microdomain formation in T-lymphocytes and early Ca2+ signaling, function of Ca2+ microdomains, and microdomain organization. Interestingly, considering the first seconds of T cell activation, a triphasic Ca2+ signal is becoming apparent: (i) initial Ca2+ microdomains occurring in the first second of T cell activation, (ii) amplification of Ca2+ microdomains by recruitment of further channels in the next 5-10 s, and (iii) a transition to global Ca2+ increase. Apparently, the second messenger nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate is the first second messenger involved in initiation of Ca2+ microdomains. Ryanodine receptors type 1 act as initial Ca2+ release channels in CD4+ T-lymphocytes. Regarding the temporal correlation of Ca2+ microdomains with other molecular events of T cell activation, T cell receptor-dependent microdomain organization of signaling molecules Grb2 and Src homology [SH2] domain-containing leukocyte protein of 65 kDa was observed within the first 20 s. In addition, fast cytoskeletal changes are initiated. Furthermore, the involvement of additional Ca2+ channels and organelles, such as the Ca2+ buffering mitochondria, is discussed.

Taken together, high-resolution Ca2+ imaging techniques applied to T cell activation in the past years paved the way to detailed molecular understanding of initial Ca2+ signaling mechanisms in non-excitable cells.", "citation_paragraph": "Since in T cells, the endogenous NAADP concentration increases upon TCR/CD3 stimulation within seconds, there is good evidence that this Ca 2+ -mobilizing second messenger plays a major role in Ca 2+ microdomain formation. This is also evidenced by recent data showing that knockdown of the three isoforms of RyR (RyR1-3) in T cells largely abolished NAADP-evoked Ca 2+ microdomains (32 (19, 32, 33) . Regarding the amplification channels, it is interesting to note that full opening of IP3R and RyR depends on the presence of the co-agonist, free Ca 2+ , besides binding of the respective second messengers IP3 and cADPR (17, 35, 36) . Further amplification of T cell Ca 2+ signaling is then realized by ER Ca 2+ depletion, resulting in Ca 2+ entry mediated via SOCE (Stim1/Orai1) (16, 34) (Figure 1 ).

In CTLs, the release of lytic granules, cellular recognition, and apoptosis are initiated within the first 5 min of target cell recognition [reviewed in Ref (44 Table 1 . The TCR binds to its cognate antigen. In principle, this activates the SRC kinase LCK, which phosphorylates immunoreceptor tyrosinebased activation motifs (not shown) in the CD3 subunits of the TCR complex. These CD3 subunits recruit and activate Zap70, which phosphorylates LAT (1-2 min) and SLP76 (10 s). SLP76 is related to Src homology [SH2] domain-containing leukocyte protein of 65 kDa (SLP65) in B-lymphocytes but is not functionally identical (47) . LAT recruits SLP76 to the cell membrane and a multimolecular complex is formed recruiting, e.g., PLC\u03b3 or the guanine exchange factor VAV (not shown). Interestingly, SLP65 has already been recruited 10 s upon activation. The adaptor protein Grb2 is constitutively bound to exchange factor son of sevenless (SOS). LAT recruits Grb2 and SOS thus activates the GTPase Ras, a crucial activator of MAPK pathways (48) . The second messenger nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate is formed by an unknown enzyme and activation process 10 s post-TCR activation. IP3 rises consecutively, formed by PLC\u03b3. Both second messengers lead to Ca 2+ release on their respective receptors RyR1 and IP3R located on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (40, 42, 47-52). for c-fos and NFAT subtypes, which are both activated via Ca 2+ signaling. Under regulation of caveolin-1, Ca 2+ microdomains formed by CRAC opening may not only activate NFAT-mediated gene expression but also reduce c-fos-mediated transcription in RBL-1 mast cells (45) . In a subsequent study, the group of Parekh found that NFAT1 is activated by Ca 2+ microdomains, whereas NFAT4 is dependent on IP3R-mediated Ca 2+ mobilization (shown in HEK293 cells) (46) . These processes were observed 20-40 min post-activation (45, 46) .Taken together, the current picture of the mechanisms underlying initial Ca 2+ microdomains consists of three phases: (i) initial Ca 2+ microdomains occurring in the first second of T cell activation, (ii) recruitment of further channels within the next 5-10 s, and (iii) transition to global Ca 2+ signaling by massive Ca 2+ entry with tens of seconds (Figure 2) . Phases (i) and (ii) depend on NAADP and its target receptor RyR1, but not on TRPM2 (TRP channel, melastatin 2) (29) . Furthermore, an early Ca 2+ entry pathway appears to be involved in phases (i) and (ii), too (29) .Propagation of Ca 2+ microdomains in activated T-lymphocytes as well as characteristics and potential function of Ca 2+ microdomains is delineated in Figure 2 .", "citance": "In a subsequent study, the group of Parekh found that NFAT1 is activated by Ca 2+ microdomains, whereas NFAT4 is dependent on IP3R-mediated Ca 2+ mobilization (shown in HEK293 cells) (46) .", "claims": [{"text": "Ca 2+ microdomains activate NFAT1.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Ca 2+ microdomains inhibit NFAT1.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "NFAT4 activation requires IP3R-mediated Ca2+ mobilization.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 49869309, "title": "Peripherally administered melanocortins induce mice fat browning and prevent obesity", "abstract": "The browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) has been in the spotlight during the last years, becoming an attractive approach to combat obesity. Melanocortin neuropeptides, such as \u03b1-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (\u03b1-MSH), are well-known regulators of appetite at the central nervous system, but its role in adipocyte metabolism is poorly elucidated. This study sought to verify if \u03b1-MSH can induce transdifferentiation of white to brown/beige adipocytes and to determine whether it can ameliorate the obesity phenotype. The browning effect of \u03b1-MSH was determined in isolated adipocytes using the 3T3-L1 cell line and in inguinal subcutaneous adipose tissue (ingWAT) of diet-induced obese (DIO) mice by quantifying the expression of browning hallmark genes, oxygen consumption, and mitochondrial biogenesis. \u03b1-MSH protection from diet-induced obesity was evaluated by analyzing mice body weight, fat mass, and lipid and glucose serum profiles. Here, we report that \u03b1-MSH activates a thermogenic gene program and increases the mitochondrial respiratory rate in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and ingWAT of DIO mice. Without affecting food intake, peripheral administration of \u03b1-MSH decreases body weight and ingWAT mass, promoting a significant rise in the number of smaller adipocytes, whereas it lowered the larger ones. Additionally, there was an increase in the mass of brown adipose tissue. Browning activation occurs concomitantly with improvement on serum lipid profile, insulin resistance, and glucose homeostasis. This study highlights the anti-obesity properties of melanocortins by promoting ingWAT browning and provides new perspectives for future designing of more effective therapeutic strategies.", "citation_paragraph": "The browning of WAT has been considered a potential mechanism to enhance energy expenditure, contributing to the control of body weight and preventing metabolic disorders. In this study we present clear in vitro and in vivo evidence demonstrating that the melanocortin \u03b1-MSH activates a browning program in WAT. This mechanism occurs concomitantly with a decrease of body weight and adiposity and further improvement of the metabolic profile of obese mice.Beige adipocytes in WAT may arise from distinct mechanisms: transdifferentiation of pre-existing white mature cells or \"de novo\" formation from beige preadipocytes precursors [4, 32] . The meticulous work of Wu and colleagues [28] , based on microarray analysis of white and beige adipocytes differentiated from ingWAT isolated precursors, identified a set of genes that might function as beige adipocyte markers, including Tmem26, Cd137, Cd40, and Tbx1. The results here presented (Fig. 3b) show a lack of variation on the expression of those genes upon \u03b1-MSH stimulation. Similar studies in ingWAT mice exposed to cold also did not detect any variation in the expression of these beige-enriched genes [33] . Wu and colleagues also showed that adipocytes derived from beige precursors respond to CL 316,243 by promoting Ucp1 expression several fold higher, compared to adipocytes derived from white adipocyte transdifferentiation, indicating that \u03b2-adrenergic stimulus browns ingWAT mainly by recruiting beige adipocyte precursors [28] . Here we show that \u03b1-MSH has a lower capacity to upregulate Ucp1 expression comparatively to CL 316,243 (Fig. 3a) . Altogether, these results raise the possibility that browning induced by \u03b1-MSH may occur through the conversion of white into beige adipocytes rather than the differentiation of beige precursors. The fact that 3T3-L1 white adipose cell line also underwent a browning phenomenon when stimulated with \u03b1-MSH provides support to this white transdifferentiation hypothesis.The physiological relevance of having thermogenic adipocytes in WAT arising from different origins has not yet been elucidated. Several studies are now coming out suggesting that specific mechanisms for WAT browning depends on the age and metabolic status varying as well with different mouse strains and in a WAT depot-specific manner [33] [34] [35] [36] . Our data suggest that different thermogenic stimuli (\u03b1-MSH and CL 316,243) may also rely on different browning mechanisms. While the elucidation of the origin of beige cells will continue a fascinating biological issue, the means to modulate their presence and function bear the potential to be an acceptable way to approach obesity treatment.Roscovitine and rosiglitazone are other browning agents that seems to transdifferentiate white adipocytes into beige cells, expressing Ucp1 and Cox7a1 genes at levels several folds lower than those induced by CL 316,243 [34] . Although \u03b1-MSH-induced Ucp1 expression was mild compared to CL 316,243 effect, both compounds produced similar levels of mitochondrial respiratory rates. This finding suggests that the thermogenic mechanism could be in part independent from UCP1. In fact, brown-like adipocytes can activate a creatine-based substrate cycling to enhance mitochondrial respiration even when UCP1-dependent thermogenesis is ablated [37] . Additionally, in beige fat, Ca 2+ cycling was described as an UCP1-independent thermogenic mechanism that controls wholebody energy homeostasis [38] .The effects of melanocortins in adipose tissue have been commonly proposed to be mediated by the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) [12] . Although we cannot exclude that possibility, a direct effect of \u03b1-MSH on adipocytes is more likely, since its browning ability was observed in isolated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Supporting that, it has been recently demonstrated that melanocortins enhance lipolysis and thermogenesis in both white and brown adipocyte cell models, respectively, in a sympathetic outflow independent mechanism [9, 10, 17] . Our in vivo studies also suggest that i.p. administered \u03b1-MSH does not interfere with the melanocortinergic central mechanisms of regulation of appetite, since we did not observe any differences in food intake between controls and \u03b1-MSHtreated animals. These data indicate no or limited interference of the MC4R expressed in the hypothalamic neurons, even though it was proposed that peripherally administered melanocortins might cross the blood-brain barrier and act on central nervous system activating their well-recognized anorexigenic signals [39] .It is thus tempting to speculate that i.p. administered \u03b1-MSH may induce its effects on mice ingWAT by direct binding to MCRs expressed in the adipose tissue. In mice, all the five MCRs (MC1R-MC5R) have been described in adipocytes, depending on the origin of the samples [9, 10, [40] [41] [42] . Given their specificity and affinity for \u03b1-MSH, with exception of MC2R, all are putative targets to mediate this melanocortin action in adipose tissue [43] . However, previous results from our group described that \u03b1-MSH effect on lipolysis and re-esterification in 3T3-L1 adipocytes is indeed mediated by MC5R. Furthermore, i.p. administered \u03b1-MSH was shown to induce lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation in mice subcutaneous adipose tissue through a MC5R-dependent mechanism [42] . Consistent with this idea, it was also demonstrated that peripheral \u03b1-MSH regulates glucose homeostasis in skeletal muscle by activating MC5R independently of SNS innervations [44] . In conclusion, although in this manuscript we do not provide direct evidence, the browning effect induced by \u03b1-MSH in ingWAT is likely to be mediated by MC5R.Beyond the browning effect observed in ingWAT and the body weight loss, mice treated with \u03b1-MSH also exhibited improvement in the metabolic profile as evidenced by the favorable changes in circulating glucose. The effect of \u03b1-MSH on glucose uptake by cells is far from being clarified since both GLUT4-dependent and -independent mechanisms were reported [44, 45] . Our data indicate that \u03b1-MSH treatment of obese mice promoted a serum glucose clearance probably mediated by GLUT4, which corroborates the findings of Enriori's group [44] . Since GLUT4 is an insulin-sensitive glucose transporter, its downregulation in the adipose tissue is strongly associated to insulin-resistant conditions like obesity and type 2 diabetes. It was observed that knocking out GLUT4 expression in adipose tissue impaired glucose uptake, enhanced insulin resistance in both adipose tissue and muscle, and thus compromised the whole-body glucose metabolism [31] . By contrast, moderated GLUT4 overexpression in DIO mice was able to improve insulin sensitivity thereby preventing their hyperinsulinemia [46] . Notwithstanding the contribution of other sources (such as liver or muscle) to glucose clearance, the upregulation of GLUT4 in ingWAT also adds to the amelioration in insulin sensitivity found in obese mice treated with \u03b1-MSH.The therapeutic potential of melanocortins in the control of obesity was, so far, only attained by designing analogs of hypothalamic MC4R agonists. Despite successive failures of the pharmaceutical industry along the way, the combination drug (Naltrexona/Bupropion) that activates the central melanocortin system (in addition to the mesolimbic dopaminergic reward system) was approved in the United States (Contrave, NDA 200063) and Europe (Mysimba, EMEA/H/C/003687). The effectiveness of this drug is however limited, promoting less than 5% reduction in body weight within 3 months of treatment and, as for other antiobesity drugs, several unwanted effects were described [47] . Thus, we are convinced that a promising approach for generating more effective and safer drugs for the treatment of obesity may involve the management of the white adipose organ directly implicated in the regulation of fat storage, fat mobilization, and metabolic homeostasis. Given the promise of WAT browning as an important therapeutic approach to combat obesity, our findings on the peripheral role of melanocortins provide new perspectives for future designing of novel therapeutic interventions.

Currently, there are no effective strategies for treating accelerated arterial stiffness. This may indicate that once arterial stiffness or vascular calcification has developed, it may be less likely to stop the ongoing pathophysiology.

This dismal outcome is largely due to delayed diagnosis, early distant dissemination and resistance to conventional chemo-therapies. Kras mutation is a well-defined hallmark of pancreatic cancer, with over 95% of cases harbouring Kras mutations that give rise to constitutively active forms of Kras. As important down-stream effectors of Kras, p21-activated kinases (PAKs) are involved in regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion/migration and chemo-resistance. Immunotherapy is now emerging as a promising treatment modality in the era of personalized anti-cancer therapeutics. In this review, basic knowledge of PAK structure and regulation is briefly summarised and the pivotal role of PAKs in Kras-driven pancreatic cancer is highlighted in terms of tumour biology and chemo-resistance. Finally, the involvement of PAKs in immune modulation in the tumour microenvironment is discussed and the potential advantages of targeting PAKs are explored.", "citation_paragraph": "MDSCs, which include both granulocytic and monocytic subsets, are a heterogeneous mixture of activated immature myeloid cells, which can stimulate angiogenesis, promote tumour invasion and migration, and suppress T-cell activation [112] . Both circulating and tumourinfiltrating MDSCs, of the granulocytic subset (Lin-HLA-DR-CD33 + CD11b + CD15 + ), but not the monocytic subset (Lin-HLA-DR-CD14 + ), are markedly elevated in patients with pancreatic cancer compared to the healthy population. Moreover, MDSCs can also serve as an independent prognostic factor for patients' survival as one unit increase in MDSC percentage leads to a 22% greater risk of mortality [113, 114] . The report by Thomas et al [115] of a non-canonical role of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein in recruiting tumourigenic MDSC suggests that cancer cells can stimulate intra-tumoural MDSC accumulation by promoting granulocyte colonystimulating factor (G-CSF) production via an mTORdependent pathway. He and colleagues demonstrated the critical role of PAK4 in regulating mTOR signalling through the PI3K/AKT axis in breast cancer [116] . In addition, PAK1 can be activated by the mTOR/p70 S6 kinase pathway, and treatment with rapamycin, a mTOR inhibitor, leads to reduced PAK1 expression [117] . Interestingly, an early study on vascular smooth muscle cells indicated that G-CSF was involved in activation of the GTPase Rac1, a potent upstream activator of PAK1, and inhibition of Rac1 suppressed G-CSF-driven migration of vascular smooth muscle cells [118] . Previous studies also found that pancreatic cancer cells or stellate cells can attract and transform peripheral blood monocytes into MDSCs via STAT3 activation, which in turn will increase the stemcell properties and mesenchymal features of tumour cells [119, 120] . The role of PAK1 and PAK4 in regulating STAT3 signalling in pancreatic cancer cells has been clearly identified [67, 121] .

{"s2orc_id": 202550492, "title": "ACLY facilitates colon cancer cell metastasis by CTNNB1", "abstract": "BACKGROUND Colon cancer is the second leading cancer worldwide. Recurrent disease and chemotherapeutic drug resistance are very common in the advanced stage of colon cancer. ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY), the first-step rate-controlling enzyme in lipid synthesis, is elevated in colon cancer. However, it remains unclear about the exact role of ACLY in the development of colon cancer metastasis.   METHODS To evaluate the role of ACLY in colon cancer metastasis, we performed cell migration and invasion assays in two ACLY-deficient colon cancer cell lines. Colon cancer mouse model is used to examine ACLY's effects on colon metastasis potentials in vivo. We analyzed the correlation between ACLY and CTNNB1 protein in 78 colon cancer patients by Pearson correlation. To finally explore the relationship of ACLY and CTNNB1, we used western blots, migration and invasion assays to confirm that ACLY may regulate metastasis by CTNNB1.   RESULTS Our data showed that the abilities of cell migration and invasion were attenuated in ACLY-deficient HCT116 and RKO cell lines. Furthermore, we describe the mechanism of ACLY in promoting colon cancer metastasis in vitro and in vivo. ACLY could stabilize CTNNB1 (beta-catenin 1) protein by interacting, and the complex might promote CTNNB1 translocation through cytoplasm to nucleus, subsequently promote the CTNNB1 transcriptional activity and migration and invasion abilities of colon cancer cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of 78 colon cancer patients showed that the high expression levels of ACLY and CTNNB1 protein was positively correlated with metastasis of colon cancer.   CONCLUSIONS These results shed new light on the molecular mechanism underlying colon cancer metastasis, which might help in improving therapeutic efficacy.", "citation_paragraph": "Rapidly proliferating tumor cells are in great demand for macromolecules, such as lipids. Since circulating lipids cannot meet the demand, cancer cells dramatically increase de novo lipogenesis [29] . The excessive accumulation of intracellular fatty acids not only contributes to the synthesis of biologic membrane in tumor cells and signaling transduction, but also promotes the process of metastasis [18] . ACLY, the first-step rate-controlling enzyme, plays a critical role in the lipid synthesis. High ACLY protein level was correlated with advanced stages and lymph node metastasis in gastric adenocarcinoma [30] . Here, we illustrate that ACLY is imperative for the invasion and metastasis of colon cancer. Mechanistically, CTNNB1 might be involved in the process.Overexpression of ACLY has been reported in breast, prostate, bladder, lung, stomach, liver and colon cancers [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . High ACLY expression level is also connected with lymph node metastasis and advanced stages in gastric adenocarcinoma [30] . Phosphorylated ACLY expression levels are a significant factor for predicting a poor prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer, together with clinical stage and tumor size [32] . Silencing ACLY suppresses cancer cell proliferation, induces stemness [37] [38] [39] , and even promotes tumor cell differentiation and senescence [40] [41] [42] . However, there are few reports about the specific role of ACLY in the process of tumor metastasis. MicroRNA-22 abates tumor cell proliferation and invasion and promotes cell apoptosis by inhibiting ACLY [43] . Low molecular weight cyclin E upregulates ACLY enzymatic activity, subsequently promoting transformation, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells [44] .Here, we observe that higher expression level of ACLY in colon cancer cells corresponds with superior migration capability. Deficiency of ACLY results in decreasing total triglycerides and cholesterol synthesis, and reducing the formation of lipid droplet. Meanwhile, we inspect that compared with the control group, the area of metastatic lesion in the lungs and livers shows a significant reduction in the ACLY-knocked-out group. Furthermore, deficiency of ACLY results in changes of epithelial and mesenchymal markers in colon cancer cell lines and nude mouse tissue samples, as EMT is a crucial step in the invasion metastasis process [45] .Previous data demonstrates that AKT upregulates ACLY activity through phosphorylation serine 454 [46] . Interestingly, Hanai J et al. show that inhibition of ACLY \"reverses signals\" and attenuates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling. ACLY knockdown cells show diminished phosphorylation of AKT [38] . Additionally, the crosstalk between the WNT/CTNNB1 and PI3K/AKT signaling has been reported in the development and progression of tumor [47, 48] . Protein kinase glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) is not only a downstream of the PI3K/AKT pathway [49] , and GSK3\u03b2 is also a part of the multicomponent complex in the WNT/CTNNB1 pathway, which phosphorylates and subsequently promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of CTNNB1 [50] . Moreover, the nuclear accumulation of CTNNB1, a key member of WNT/CTNNB1 pathway, might indicate higher rate of metastasis in colon cancer [51] . We wonder if ACLY affects the WNT/CTNNB1 signaling pathway, especially CTNNB1, in colon cancer metastasis. Therefore, we detect the protein levels of ACLY and CTNNB1 in colon cancer pathological tissue. Results show that ACLY is positively relative to CTNNB1. This phenomenon is more pronounced in the metastasis subgroup. And patients with high levels of both ACLY and CTNNB1 have poorer prognosis. Coincidently, we find that ACLY combined with CTNNB1. The complex may increase the stability of CTNNB1 protein and facilitate the accumulation of CTNNB1 in the nucleus, subsequently promoting the CTNNB1 transcriptional activity and the migration and invasion abilities of colon cancer. However, this study has not yet clarified whether the ACLY-CTNNB1 complex could enter cellular nucleus and affect the formation of complexes in WNT/CTNNB1 pathway. Besides, a report has shown ACLY facilitates histone acetylation near double-strand breaks and promotes BRCA1 recruitment and homologous recombination when DNA damage [52] . It is valuable to detect whether ACLY promotes the acetylation of CTNNB1 and the relationship of its phosphorylation and acetylation.", "citance": "Since circulating lipids cannot meet the demand, cancer cells dramatically increase de novo lipogenesis [29] .", "claims": [{"text": "Cancer cells dramatically decrease de novo lipogenesis during rapid proliferation.", "subject": "Cancer cells", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Cancer cells dramatically increase de novo lipogenesis during rapid proliferation.", "subject": "Cancer cells", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 8130273, "title": "Exosomal miRNAs and miRNA dysregulation in cancer-associated fibroblasts", "abstract": "PURPOSE The present review aimed to assess the role of exosomal miRNAs in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), normal fibroblasts (NFs), and cancer cells. The roles of exosomal miRNAs and miRNA dysregulation in CAF formation and activation were summarized.   METHODS All relevant publications were retrieved from the PubMed database, with key words such as CAFs, CAF, stromal fibroblasts, cancer-associated fibroblasts, miRNA, exosomal, exosome, and similar terms.   RESULTS Recent studies have revealed that CAFs, NFs, and cancer cells can secrete exosomal miRNAs to affect each other. Dysregulation of miRNAs and exosomal miRNAs influence the formation and activation of CAFs. Furthermore, miRNA dysregulation in CAFs is considered to be associated with a secretory phenotype change, tumor invasion, tumor migration and metastasis, drug resistance, and poor prognosis.   CONCLUSIONS Finding of exosomal miRNA secretion provides novel insights into communication among CAFs, NFs, and cancer cells. MicroRNA dysregulation is also involved in the whole processes of CAF formation and function. Dysregulation of miRNAs in CAFs can affect the secretory phenotype of the latter cells.", "citation_paragraph": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a major class of small non-coding RNAs that mediate post-transcriptional gene silencing by binding to the 3\u2032-untranslated region (UTR) or open reading frames (ORFs) of target mRNAs, have been widely studied in various physiological and pathological processes [1, 2] . Similar to protein coding genes, most miRNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II to form terminal and poly-adenylated RNA precursors or primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) [3] . Stress-signals in cancer cells regulate the production of particular pri-miRNAs by controlling the functionality of certain transcription factors [4] . Established roles of miRNAs include the regulation of cell growth and tissue differentiation [5] .As both processes are dysregulated in cancer formation and development, miRNAs can participate in several processes of cancer, such as metastasis, tumorigenesis, and drug resistance [6] [7] [8] . Previous studies reported that miRNAs might serve as a tool for cancer diagnosis [9] , and dysregulation of miRNA expression could be used for patient prognosis [10] . In recent years, with the progress witnessed in exosome assessment, use of miRNA as a biomarker or therapeutic tool in clinical practice has become a reality [11, 12] .The microenvironment consists of different types of normal cells, including fibroblasts, endothelial cells, pericytes, immune cells, and local or bone marrow-derived stromal stem and progenitor cells, and the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) [13] . Tumor microenvironment heterogeneity can influence tumorigenesis, invasion, metastasis, and the therapeutic response [14, 15] . Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are vital constituents of the tumor microenvironment, and their interactions with cancer cells play a major role in mediating the formation and activation of CAFs [16] . In a mouse model of pancreatic insulinoma, it was found that 20-40% of CAFs originate from the bone marrow [17, 18] . Meanwhile, recent data indicated that stimulation of the u-PA/u-PAR system contributes to CAF activation during multiple myeloma (MM) progression [19] . In addition, cancer development depends not only on malignant cancer cells, but also on CAF activation [20] . The crosstalk between cancer cells and CAFs is responsible for cancer cell proliferation, metastasis, invasion, and other critical oncological behaviors [21, 22] . CAFs necessitate targeted treatment, which improves anti-cancer therapy in vitro and animal experiments [23, 24] .Accumulating evidence suggests that miRNAs play a critical role not only in cancer cells but also in the tumor microenvironment [25] . The dysregulation of miRNAs and exosomal miRNAs can influence the crosstalk between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment [26, 27] .This review focused on the bridging role that exosomal miRNAs play among CAFs, NFs, and cancer cells, exploring how exosomal miRNAs and miRNA dysregulation activate CAFs. We also demonstrated that miRNA dysregulation mediates functional changes in CAFs.Exosomal miRNAs constitute a bridge among CAFs, NFs, and cancer cells Previous studies demonstrated that CAFs and cancer cells regulate each other by secreting a variety of cytokines, chemokines, and extracellular matrix (ECM) [28] [29] [30] [31] . However, the mechanism underlying the communication among CAFs, NFs, and cancer cells remains unclear. Recent extracellular vesicle assessments demonstrated that cancer cells communicate with the neighboring cells via soluble factors secreted into the extracellular space [32, 33] . Extracellular vesicles can be classified into three main types according to size and biogenesis: exosomes (30-100 nm), microvesicles (100-1000 nm), and oncosomes (1-10 \u03bcm) [34] . Each of these three vesicle types plays crucial roles in cancer biology, with vesicular transport, particularly 'exosome' mediated transport standing out [35] [36] [37] .Exosomes contain a great variety of bioactive molecules, including signal peptides, microRNAs, lipids, and DNA [38] . A recent study demonstrated that a number of Rab family proteins, including Rab27a and Rab27b, act as key regulators of the exosome secretion pathway [39] . Exosome biogenesis is a very tightly regulated process governed by multiple signaling molecules, and begins with receptor activation that is unique to each cell type [40] . In cancer, tumor cells aberrantly secrete large amounts of exosomes to transport paracrine signals or to contribute to tumorenvironment interactions at a distance. Exosomal miRNAs were first identified in human serum, and have also been described in several biological fluids, including saliva, breast milk, and urine [41] . Therefore, EVs containing exosomal miRNAs can regulate tumorigenesis and cancer development by altering the vesicular content and supplying the tumor niche with molecules favoring the progression of oncogenic processes such as proliferation, invasion, cancer stem cell propagation, and even drug resistance [42] . Thus, exosomal miRNAs mediate cell to cell communication and play major roles in the crosstalk between cancer cells and the macro\u2212/microenvironment [43, 44] . More importantly, miRNAs are stably transferred by exosomes [45] . MicroRNAs in plasma exosome can be stably stored under different conditions, indicating that exosomal miRNAs are potential biomarkers or therapeutic tools [46] .", "citance": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are vital constituents of the tumor microenvironment, and their interactions with cancer cells play a major role in mediating the formation and activation of CAFs [16] .", "claims": [{"text": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are constituents of tumor microenvironments", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have no known interaction with cancer cells in the formation and activation of CAFs.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) interact with cancer cells to mediate formation and activation of CAFs.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Whereas lung and breast adenocarcinomas could invade the pleural space because of their anatomic proximity, \"distant\" cancers like ovarian or gastrointestinal tract adenocarcinomas may employ more active mechanisms to the same end. A pleural metastasis is often accompanied by a malignant pleural effusion (MPE), an unfavorable complication that severely restricts the quality of life and expectancy of the cancer patient. MPE is the net \"product\" of three different processes, namely inflammation, enhanced angiogenesis and vascular leakage. Current efforts are focusing on the identification of cancer cell autocrine (specific mutation spectra and biochemical pathways) and paracrine (cytokine and chemokine signals) characteristics as well as host features (immunological or other) that underlie the MPE phenotype. Herein we examine the pleural histology, cytology and molecular characteristics that make the pleural cavity an attractive metastasis destination for lung adenocarcinoma. Mesothelial and tumor features that may account for the tumor's ability to invade the pleural space are highlighted. Finally, possible therapeutic interventions specifically targeting MPE are discussed.", "citation_paragraph": "Lung cancer, the major killer cancer accounting for millions of deaths every year world-wide (http://seer.cancer.gov/ statfacts/html/lungb.html) is a heterogeneous disease group, divided into two major categories, non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). This distinction is based on the histologic features, response to conventional therapies and the biology of the cancer genome. More specifically, SCLC is generally associated with smoking-elaborated RB1 point mutations, whereas NSCLC includes three cell types (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma), further divided into various subtypes or variants. Lung adenocarcinoma is the most frequent type accounting for 40% of the cases (6) . The molecular trends of lung adenocarcinoma include a high mutation rate of 8.87 mutations per megabase DNA (predominantly C to A transversions) and tumors bearing 46% TP53, 33% KRAS and 14% EGFR mutations (7). Transversion-high groups correlate with a positive smoking history and mutations in the KRAS gene.Epidemiologically, gender differences exist because female non-smokers appear prone to transversion-low EGFR mutations (7, 8) . Additionally, lung cancer signatures in Asiatic populations are similar to that of Caucasian origin with transversions being predominant in smokers. However, in Asian populations the percentages of mutated EGFR and KRAS appear to be reversed when compared to Caucasians, with EGFR mutations accounting for 30-40% and KRAS for 10% or less of NSCLC cases (9) . Although the basis for this demographic difference is not known, genetic factors rather than smoking, second hand smoking or environmental carcinogens causing oxidative DNA damage probably account for the increased EGFR mutation percentages in Asian ethnicities (10) .KRAS and EGFR are key features in a receptor tyrosine kinase pathway (RTK, namely the EGFR signaling pathway) which is active in virtually all mammalian epithelia. EGFR (alternatively ERBB1 or HER1) encodes for a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase that, upon binding to a variety of extracellular ligands (TGF-\u03b1, amphiregulin, epigen, betacellulin, epiregulin and heparin-binding EGF), signals through two major axes in the cell cytoplasm (i.e., RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK/MAPK pathway and PIK3CA/AKT/ mTOR pathways) and thus controls every aspect of cellular life and death such as survival, growth, proliferation, and apoptosis. A staggering 75% of lung adenocarcinomas are caused by mutations appearing in the RAS/RAF/ MEK/ERK/MAPK pathway, whereas a minor 25% are attributed to PIK3CA/AKT/mTOR pathway mutations (7) . Evidently, autocrine EGFR signaling contributes to tumor cell proliferation, apoptosis evasion and metastasis whereas paracrine signaling contributes to cancer associated inflammation, angiogenesis and metastasis. Both mutations and deletions, as well as perturbations of gene copy numbers affecting mostly ten genes of the EGFR signaling pathway confer growth and evolutionary advantage to lung adenocarcinoma cells. These are the \"driver\" oncogenes, namely the RTKs, EGFR and HER2, the RAS family members KRAS and NRAS and the kinases ALK, BRAF, PIK3CA, AKT, ROS, and MAP2K1. Usually, a single overactive oncogene underlies the proliferation and survival of lung adenocarcinoma through a mechanism known as \"oncogene addiction\" (11) . With the exception of PIK3CA co-existing with mutations in EGFR and KRAS, other driver gene mutations are mutually exclusive in lung cancer. This is particularly exemplified between mutations of EGFR (~12-14%) and KRAS genes (~33-35%) that together account for the 47% of NSCLC cases in western countries. However, exceptions to this have been recently identified (12, 13) . The conceptual breakthrough of driver oncogene identification, oncogene addiction and the exclusivity of oncogenic mutations in lung cancer (in both cancer research and treatment) lead to the application of RTK inhibitors (TKI) targeting mutant EFGR, along with conventional chemotherapy in the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma.TKIs gefitinib and erlotinib are approved for NSCLC patients worldwide. Erlotinib significantly prolongs the survival time of patients with advanced NSCLC (14) . In recent years many studies reported that TKIs specifically benefit NSCLC patients bearing EGFR mutations.However, despite cytotoxic chemotherapy, which does not alter EGFR mutation status, TKI treatment confers improvement in the overall survival of patients bearing EGFR mutations, but on the other hand-shortly after initial lung cancer remission-frequently results in cancer resistance (15) . Cancers that initially benefit from EGFR targeted therapies subsequently become refractory by a plethora of mechanisms and the task to combat them becomes ever more difficult (16) . Additionally, due to evolutionary pressure posed by EGFR targeted therapies, tumors may select mutation spectra that predispose to new more aggressive forms that metastasize to the pleura or distant organs [(17) , and see below]. KRAS is downstream of EGFR in their common signaling pathway and mutations in KRAS would lead to cancer growth regardless of EGFR signal modulation via TKIs or antibodies against mutant EGFR. Indeed, KRAS mutations are negative predictive biomarkers of TKI therapies (18) . Wild type EGFR status and the presence of KRAS mutations should not necessarily be used to exclude cancer patients for treatment with TKIs as minor (but significant) benefits can be exerted to these patients predominantly by erlotinib (19) (20) (21) .", "citance": "Cancers that initially benefit from EGFR targeted therapies subsequently become refractory by a plethora of mechanisms and the task to combat them becomes ever more difficult (16) .", "claims": [{"text": "Cancers that initially benefit from epidermal growth factor receptor targeted therapies later become refractory through several mechanisms.

As expected, buff-breasted wrens exhibited smaller clutch sizes and higher annual adult survival than Carolina wrens. We found minimal support for the nest predation hypothesis, as nest survival and age-corrected provisioning rates to whole broods were similar between species, and number of breeding attempts and breeding season length were greater in temperate wrens. Critical predictions of the food limitation hypothesis were not supported; in particular age-corrected provisioning rates per nestling were higher in the tropical than temperate species. The adult survival and offspring quality hypothesis garnered the most support, as buff-breasted wrens exhibited greater age-corrected provisioning rates per nestling, a longer nestling period, longer re-nesting intervals following nest success, and lower annual fecundity than Carolina wrens. Despite similarly prolonged breeding seasons, reproductive strategies differ between species with buff-breasted wrens investing considerably in single broods to optimize first-year survival and Carolina wrens investing in multiple small broods to optimize annual fecundity.", "citation_paragraph": "Understanding the selective pressures that favor pace-oflife strategies across environmental gradients has been a central focus of studies of life-history evolution (Williams 1966 , Badyaev and Ghalambor 2001 , Martin 2004 , Robinson et al. 2010 . Among songbirds, a general pattern is that species from tropical and south-temperate regions exhibit smaller clutch sizes, higher adult survival, and an overall slower pace-of-life compared with species from more northerly latitudes, which lay larger clutches, have lower survival, and live at the 'fast' end of the life-history continuum (Moreau 1944 , Lack 1947 , Skutch 1949 , Martin 1996 , Ricklefs 2000 , Jetz et al. 2008 , Robinson et al. 2010 ). Each of the major hypotheses for life history evolution in birds (Table 1) predicts reductions in clutch size from northerly to southerly latitudes, therefore to advance lifehistory theory, data on additional traits that comprise relatively smaller proportions of reproductive effort are needed (Martin 1996 , Robinson et al. 2010 . Less is known about latitudinal variation in these other life history traits, such as duration of nestling care, nestling feeding rates, and number of breeding attempts per year (Martin 2004 , but see Martin 2002 , Schaefer et al. 2004 , Ferretti et al. 2005 , but many are predicted to respond differently to selection from food limitation, nest predation, and adult survival (Martin 1996 , Robinson et al. 2010 .In this study, we tested hypotheses for life-history evolution (Table 1) by comparing a suite of life-history traits and parental care strategies of two wren species (family Troglodytidae) that inhabit low-and high-latitude environments.

These are closely related species that inhabit different latitudes, but they share key intrinsic factors known to influence life-history evolution (Jetz et al. 2008) . Both species are small insectivores, which are non-migratory and defend year-round territories (Haggerty and Morton 1995, Gill 2011) . Moreover, both species exhibit genetic monogamy combined with long-term partnerships (Haggerty et al. 2001 , Gill and Stutchbury 2006 ; thus, the influence of sexual selection in shaping their life history traits is similar (Bonduriansky et al. 2008) . Differences in life-history traits between the two species should therefore be due primarily to differences in selection pressures between latitudes (Jetz et al. 2008) .

Inflammasome activation initiates the maturation and release of the inflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2 and the programmed cell death pathway pyroptosis in a caspase-1-dependent manner.

Cardiac glycoside-induced cellular cytotoxicity and IL-1\u03b2 signaling are likewise antagonized by inhibitors of the NLRP3 inflammasome or the IL-1 receptor-targeting biologic Anakinra. Our results inform on the molecular mechanism by which the inflammasome integrates the diverse signals that activate it through secondary signals like cation flux.

{"s2orc_id": 1618397, "title": "Targeting Trachoma Control through Risk Mapping: The Example of Southern Sudan", "abstract": "BACKGROUND Trachoma is a major cause of blindness in Southern Sudan. Its distribution has only been partially established and many communities in need of intervention have therefore not been identified or targeted. The present study aimed to develop a tool to improve targeting of survey and control activities.   METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS A national trachoma risk map was developed using Bayesian geostatistics models, incorporating trachoma prevalence data from 112 geo-referenced communities surveyed between 2001 and 2009. Logistic regression models were developed using active trachoma (trachomatous inflammation follicular and/or trachomatous inflammation intense) in 6345 children aged 1-9 years as the outcome, and incorporating fixed effects for age, long-term average rainfall (interpolated from weather station data) and land cover (i.e. vegetation type, derived from satellite remote sensing), as well as geostatistical random effects describing spatial clustering of trachoma. The model predicted the west of the country to be at no or low trachoma risk. Trachoma clusters in the central, northern and eastern areas had a radius of 8 km after accounting for the fixed effects.   CONCLUSION In Southern Sudan, large-scale spatial variation in the risk of active trachoma infection is associated with aridity. Spatial prediction has identified likely high-risk areas to be prioritized for more data collection, potentially to be followed by intervention.", "citation_paragraph": "Trachoma, caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis, is the most common infectious cause of blindness and the leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide [1, 2] . The disease is easily transmitted through transfer of ocular secretions infected with C. trachomatis to the eyes of an uninfected individual by flies, hands, towels or sharing of other personal items. Repeated infection with C. trachomatis leads to scarring of the conjunctiva and eventually entropion, causing the lashes of the inwardly-turned eyelid to abrade the corneal surface, a condition referred to as trichiasis [3, 4] . Unless eyelid deformation is managed surgically, trichiasis causes irreversible scarring of the cornea leading to corneal opacity and, eventually, blindness. Trachomatous trichiasis (TT) in children is an indication of high-intensity transmission.Like all other neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) trachoma is associated with poverty [5, 6] , as well as poor hygiene [7, 8] . Prevention is partly based on improving personal hygiene by promoting facial cleanliness and providing clean water for face washing, and promoting the safe disposal of human faeces, thereby reducing fly abundance [9] . Facial cleanliness and Environmental improvement form two of the four components of the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended ''SAFE'' strategy for trachoma control, which also includes Surgical correction of trichiasis and mass drug administration (MDA) of Antibiotics in endemic communities [10] .Studies have shown trachoma risk to be associated with attributes of the physical and social environment [8] . Risk factors include environmental aridity, nomadic pastoral livelihoods (i.e. predominantly livestock-rearing), increasing distance from water sources and household crowding [7, [11] [12] [13] . Given that environmental factors are important drivers of trachoma risk, it is plausible to predict the spatial distribution of trachoma using statistical associations between disease prevalence and environmental variables. Linkage of trachoma survey data to environmental variables can be performed in a geographical information system (GIS). Statistical models can then be used to estimate the relationship between trachoma risk and environmental variables, and to predict trachoma risk in non-sampled locations based on their environmental attributes. Schemann and colleagues used such (non-spatial) multivariate logistic regression model with trachoma data from Mali, finding that prevalence of active trachoma was negatively correlated with rainfall, in turn resulting in a north-south gradient of trachoma risk [14] .A major recent advance in risk mapping has been the development of model-based geostatistics, providing a statistically robust platform for prediction of disease risk based simultaneously on environmental covariates and functions of spatial autocorrelation [15] . The model outputs are distributions, rather than point estimates, which fully represent prediction uncertainties and enable flexible statistical inference, such as determining the probability that risk in a location is above a specific threshold [16] . Risk maps derived from model-based geostatistical predictions have been used to increase the efficiency of some NTD control programmes, such as for schistosomiasis and soiltransmitted helminths in sub-Saharan Africa, by allowing targeting of resources to areas where they were likely to have the greatest impact [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . However, to date these epidemiological advances have not been applied to the management of trachoma control programmes.Cataract and trachoma are the two most important causes of blindness in Southern Sudan [24] . Recent surveys have found both extremely high prevalence of active trachoma (trachomatous inflammation-follicular (TF) and/or trachomatous inflammationintense (TI)) and evidence of TT in children in some of the areas surveyed [25, 26] . These findings indicate that trachoma constitutes a major problem to public health in Southern Sudan [27] . However, not all of Southern Sudan is equally at risk, as indicated by recent surveys that identified areas where trachoma is not endemic [28] . Generating a better understanding of the geographical distribution of trachoma is therefore important so that the limited available resources can be better targeted. To provide the National Trachoma Control Programme with a tool to prioritise areas for SAFE intervention we develop a model that takes account of spatial correlation in the data, aiming to identify important environmental predictors of trachoma risk in Southern Sudan and to use these to develop a trachoma risk map.", "citance": "Cataract and trachoma are the two most important causes of blindness in Southern Sudan [24] .", "claims": [{"text": "Cataract and trachoma are the primary cause of blindness in Southern Sudan.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

We discuss in detail the intricate involvement of AAA+ protein complexes in controlling sporulation, the heat shock response and the role of adaptor proteins in these processes. The investigation of these protein complexes and their adaptor proteins has revealed their relevance for Gram-positive pathogens and their potential as targets for new antibiotics.", "citation_paragraph": "Endospore formation is a terminal cellular developmental process leading to two different types of cells in a structure termed the sporangium. This event begins with asymmetric cell division, after which the larger mother cell encloses the smaller forespore cell and supports its development into an endospore. This concerted cellular developmental process culminates in the release of the endospore from the lysing mother cell (Rudner and Losick, 2001; Higgins and Dworkin, 2012) . The endospore is metabolically inactive and highly resistant to most stressors and environmental extremes (Piggot and Hilbert, 2004) . Once the cell has committed to this developmental process, it is irreversible (Dworkin and Losick, 2005) . Consequently, half of the progeny will transform into an endospore, whereas the other half will die. It is therefore critical that this process is tightly regulated. Indeed, the decision whether or not to commit to this complex developmental process is controlled by multiple regulatory circuits that integrate several distinct signals (Higgins and Dworkin, 2012) . Interestingly, AAA+ protease complexes have several important roles at various stages of this complex decision-making process. The roles of ClpCP, ClpXP and FtsH sporulation have been elucidated in detail (Pan et al., 2001; Bradshaw and Losick, 2015; Tan et al., 2015) .One of the interesting aspects of sporulation is an asymmetric cell division that results in two unequally sized daughter cells a smaller forespore and a larger mother cell. Upon asymmetric division, both cells engage specific and distinct gene expression programs that ultimately determine their markedly different fates (Piggot and Hilbert, 2004) . The first cell type-specific genetic program is the activation of the alternative sigma factor F in the forespore, which depends on both a partner-switching mechanism involving the anti-sigma factor SpoIIAB and the antianti-sigma factor SpoIIAA, and also on the activity of the PP2C phosphatase SpoIIE (Stragier and Losick, 1996) . Sigma F and all factors required for its activation are produced at the onset of sporulation and thus are present in both cell compartments (Gholamhoseinian and Piggot, 1989) . For over two decades it was not understood how Sigma F is activated exclusively in the forespore. SpoIIE is the critical controller of the activation of Sigma F: it de-phosphorylates SpoIIAA, which can then activate Sigma F (Stragier and Losick, 1996) . Intriguingly, SpoIIE is expressed in both compartments but the protein is found only in the forespore (Gholamhoseinian and Piggot, 1989 ). Bradshaw and Losick recently implicated the AAA+ protease FtsH in the compartment specific regulation of SpoIIE stability during the early stages of sporulation (Bradshaw and Losick, 2015) .They showed that SpoIIE is subject to FtsH-dependent degradation in the mother cell, but is protected from proteolysis in the forespore. This specific stabilization results in the accumulation of active SpoIIE proteins in the forespore that lead to the forespore-specific activation of Sigma F (Figure 4A) . The stabilization of SpoIIE in the forespore is not linked to differences in FtsH expression or activity in the different compartments.Normally, SpoIIE is degraded by FtsH upon recognition of an N-terminal degradation tag. However, relocation of SpoIIE from the polar divisome to the cell pole results in stabilization of SpoIIE by a mechanism that is not yet fully understood but seems to involve SpoIIE oligomerization (Bradshaw and Losick, 2015 ; Figure 4A ). Nonetheless, the local control of SpoIIE degradation is a great example of how proteolysis can be a crucial regulatory mechanism in the control of cell polarity.Interestingly, FtsH is not the only AAA+ protease that is involved in the control of SigmaF activity. It has been shown that the ClpCP protease is responsible for the degradation of the anti-sigma factor SpoIIAB (Pan et al., 2001) . Under normal growth conditions, SpoIIAB interacts and thus inactivates Sigma F (Duncan and Losick, 1993) . This interaction is also thought to stabilize SpoIIAB. Upon de-phosphorylation of the anti-antisigma factor SpoIIAA by SpoIIE, SigmaF is liberated (Stragier and Losick, 1996) and SpoIIAB is subject to ClpCP-dependent degradation (Pan et al., 2001) . Although, this proteolytic mechanism is not directly involved in the activation of SigmaF, it is required to maintain the stability of free Sigma F (Pan et al., 2001) . Targeting of SpoIIAB for ClpCP-dependent degradation is enabled by the presence of the C-terminal amino acid sequence LCN (Pan et al., 2001; Pan and Losick, 2003) . Interestingly, none of the described ClpC adaptors are involved in the proteolysis of SpoIIAB, which implicates a hitherto unidentified adaptor or molecular mechanism in this process (Kirstein et al., 2009b) . Since artificially LCN-tagged proteins are also subject to degradation during exponential growth (Pan and Losick, 2003) , it is unlikely that this process depends on a sporulation-specific adaptor protein ( Figure 4B ).Regulated proteolysis is also involved in the control mechanisms ensuring proper spore formation. The ClpXP protease together with the adaptor protein CmpA are involved in the quality control of the spore envelope. In cells that produce spores with a proper spore envelope, CmpA is degraded through ClpXP-dependent proteolysis and sporulation continues. However, in cells that display defects in the spore envelope maturation, CmpA is stabilized and mediates ClpXPdependent degradation of the coat morphogenetic protein SpoIVA. This proteolytic event causes instability and subsequent lysis of the spore, thereby ensuring that only properly assembled spores are produced within the population. The presence of ClpXP and CmpA is required but not sufficient for degradation of SpoIVA and also of CmpA itself. The proteolytic activity of this regulatory circuit depends on the presence of a specific signal or component that is under the control of the cell typespecific Sigma K. However, the nature of this signal or component is unclear and requires further investigation (Tan et al., 2015 ; Figure 4C ).The three mechanisms described above are examples of how regulated protein degradation is involved in the control of sporulation. In addition, evidence exists that AAA+ proteases and their associated proteolytic events play even more roles in the control of sporulation. A recent global high-throughput genetic screen highlighted the pleiotropic function of ClpC in the control of sporulation. Meeske and colleagues showed that cells lacking clpC had a dramatic defect in sporulation efficiency and displayed different phenotypes, such as delayed entry, asymmetric engulfment, reduced or no Sigma G activity and a concomitant small forespore phenotype (Meeske et al., 2016) . This observation suggests that ClpC is specifically involved in the control of distinct but yet unknown regulatory events during sporulation.", "citance": "Meeske and colleagues showed that cells lacking clpC had a dramatic defect in sporulation efficiency and displayed different phenotypes, such as delayed entry, asymmetric engulfment, reduced or no Sigma G activity and a concomitant small forespore phenotype (Meeske et al., 2016) .", "claims": [{"text": "Cells lacking clpC have a defect in sporulation efficiency in Bacillus subtilis.

Animals subjected to MR, display changes in metabolic flexibility demonstrated by increases in energy expenditure, glucose tolerance, and lifespan. These changes have been well characterized in a number of model systems and significant progress has been made in understanding how hepatic fibroblast growth factor 21 links MR to several components of its metabolic phenotype. Despite these advances, a complete understanding of mechanisms engaged by dietary MR remains elusive. In this review, we offer a brief history of MR and its known mechanisms associated with stress, metabolism, and lifespan extension. We consider the role of epigenetics in the response of animals to MR and propose a novel epigenetic pathway involving the regulation of microRNAs during MR.", "citation_paragraph": "MicroRNAs are small endogenous 18-22 base pair nucleotide sequences (62) that play roles in mediating posttranscriptional gene silencing in mammals, plants, and invertebrate organisms (63, 64) . They are synthesized from primary miRNAs by two enzymes Drosha in the nucleus and Dicer in the cytoplasm (65) and are bound by Argonaute subfamily of proteins before integration into the RISC complex. After integration miRNAs have the ability to post transcriptionally regulate gene expression through the formation of RNA duplexes (62) . The miRNA profile changes with age and numerous miRNAs that are affected by age are also regulated by CR (66), suggesting these regulatory RNA molecules are associated with CR-induced extension of lifespan. Many of these miRNAs associated with the IGF-1 PI3K/AKT mTOR signaling pathways are important for nutrient sensing and subsequent physiological response during CR.Recent evidence also supports a role for miRNAs in the MR phenotype in teleosts and mammals. Rainbow trout myosatellite cells exposed to methionine-deficient cell media regulate miRNAs that reduce their capacity for differentiation (miR-133a, miR-206, and miR-210) (4). Rainbow trout fed an MR (0.775%) diet for 4 weeks had lower levels of miR-133a in the skeletal Physiological and Molecular Mechanisms of MR Frontiers in Endocrinology | www.frontiersin.orgMay 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 217 muscle at 4 weeks and increased glucose tolerance following a glucose challenge at 8 weeks (5). Mice consuming an MR diet (0.12%) exhibit increased expression of miR-133a, miR-335-5p, and miR-204 in the bone marrow as well as miR-31 in the plasma and liver (5, 6, 67, 68) . Although these studies did not directly investigate the aging response, they do indicate that miRNAs are regulated by methionine availability and potentially play a role in the metabolic phenotype. While miRNAs have traditionally been known to repress transcription, evidence suggests that cells undergoing an ISR, such as those under MR, may activate miRNAs to regulate a unique suite of mRNAs to maintain homeostasis (69) . As previously mentioned, a potential mechanism of MR is through the GCN2 amino acid deprivation pathway and the PERK/NRF2 (Figure 1) pathway. Both of these kinases phosphorylate eIF2\u03b1, which activates ATF4 and induces the formation of stress granules (70) containing miRNAs, mRNA targets, and Argonaute proteins (71) . Similar to MR, leucine deficiency activates GCN2/ ATF4 (72) , which increases expression of miRNA-212-5p that subsequently reduces lipid accumulation (72) and enhances gluconeogenesis (73) . Although the effect of leucine restriction on lifespan is opposite that of MR, activation of GCN2/ATF4 and subsequent regulation of specific miRNAs appears to be a common response to cellular stress induced by amino acid restriction.While the notion of miRNA involvement in the MR phenotype is new, it is well-known that a few miRNAs regulate cellular stress response in other situations. miR-211 is known as a pro-survival miRNA during ER stress activated by the PERK pathway (74) . In this circumstance, miR-211 is used to attenuate the amount of the pro-apoptotic transcription factor chop and keep the cell from initiating apoptosis during periods of short-term ER stress. miR-122 causes a repression of the cationic amino acid transporter-1 under normal conditions. Under varying conditions of stress, this miR can de-repress the mRNA transcript and cause it to be localized to the polysomes (75) . For a full review of how miRNAs are regulated during stress responses, see Leung and Sharp (76) . Because MR is known to activate the PERK pathway without induction of ER stress (47) the connection between MR and miRNAs must be interpreted carefully and warrants further study.", "citance": "While miRNAs have traditionally been known to repress transcription, evidence suggests that cells undergoing an ISR, such as those under MR, may activate miRNAs to regulate a unique suite of mRNAs to maintain homeostasis (69) .", "claims": [{"text": "Cells undergoing methionine restriction may activate miRNAs.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "miRNAs regulate a unique suite of mRNAs to maintain homeostasis in cells.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Emerging evidence suggests an intimate interplay between the circadian clock and another fundamental rhythmic process, the cell cycle. However, the precise mechanisms of this connection are not fully understood. Disruption of circadian rhythms has a profound impact on cell division and cancer development and, vice versa, malignant transformation causes disturbances of the circadian clock. Conventional knowledge attributes tumor suppressor properties to the circadian clock. However, this implication might be context-dependent, since, under certain conditions, the clock can also promote tumorigenesis. Therefore, a better understanding of the molecular links regulating the physiological balance between the two cycles will have potential significance for the treatment of cancer and associated disorders.", "citation_paragraph": "Circadian rhythms in cell division were documented in various biological systems, such as cyanobacteria and unicellular eukaryotes, suggesting a link between two oscillators [7] . Based on these observations, it was proposed that the circadian oscillator could act as an additional checkpoint, allowing (\"gating\") cell divisions only during certain time windows [53] . Indeed, in cyanobacteria, cell proliferation shows clear gating by the circadian clock, although the period of cell division cycles is much shorter than one day (around 10 h) [54, 55] . Studies in humans and mice also report circadian variations in DNA replication and rhythmic expression of cell cycle components in different tissues in vivo [56] [57] [58] [59] . Development of fluorescent circadian reporters allowed for investigation of circadian rhythms in isolated cells devoid of systemic cues. In NIH 3T3 cells, the incidence of cell division events relative to the circadian cycle is highly non-random and exhibits a trimodal frequency distribution, suggesting that cellular clocks predetermine the timing of mitosis [60] . Subsequent mathematical analyses confirmed the intimate link between both oscillators in NIH 3T3 cells [61, 62] . Interestingly, both experimental data and stochastic modelling defined the nature of this interaction as a 1:1 phase locking (i.e., oscillations with a common frequency) rather than a gating, as suggested earlier [53, 61, 62] . Another remarkable finding was reported by a recent study using complex tissue culture techniques such as 3D intestinal organoids. The authors revealed that intercellular coupling helps stem cells to synchronize their cell divisions with local circadian pacemakers residing in secretory Paneth cells. Rhythmic secretion of Wnt by Paneth cells entrains the cell cycle of adjacent stem cells and progenitor cells bearing weak circadian oscillators [63] .Similar to what is observed in cellular circadian clocks, genetically identical cells tend to show high variabilities in cell cycle durations [64] . Are the factors responsible for this variability stochastic and set randomly, independent of initial conditions, or deterministic and rely on certain inherited components? Recently, Sandler et al. addressed this issue in an elegant experimental approach comparing cell cycle durations among different lineages of cells. They found high correlations in pairs of sister and cousin cells, and no correlation between mother and daughter cells [65] . This property, termed the \"cousin-mother inequality\", suggests deterministic inheritance within the system. A \"kicked cell cycle\" model, built on this experimental data, assumes the existence of a certain independent oscillator, whose phase after each cell division would determine the duration of the next cell cycle. It is still unclear whether this underlying oscillator is the circadian clock, but some hints, such as inheritance of the circadian phase by the daughter cells upon division, point in this direction [60, 65, 66] .In contrast, certain cell types show a marked absence of coupling between the clock and the cell cycle. In rat1 fibroblasts, luciferase activity of the cell cycle reporter (CCNB1-dGluc) is rhythmic but not temperature compensated, and does not correlate with oscillations of the circadian Bmal1-dGluc reporter [67] . Similar phenomena are observed in Lewis lung carcinoma cells [68] . Taken together, both oscillators show robust coupling in vivo and in vitro; however, under certain conditions, immortalized or cancer cell lines uncouple their cell division from the circadian control.", "citance": "Subsequent mathematical analyses confirmed the intimate link between both oscillators in NIH 3T3 cells [61, 62] .", "claims": [{"text": "Cellular clocks are associated with mitosis timing in NIH 3T3 cells.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Cellular clocks are not predictive of mitosis timing in NIH 3T3 cells.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Mathematical analyses confirmed the link between circadian rhythm and cell division in NIH 3T3 cells.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

However, shortly afterwards it became obvious that in Saccharomyces pombe and all other higher organisms ARSs were not sufficient to initiate independent replication. Understanding the mechanisms of replication is a major challenge in modern cell biology and is also a prerequisite to developing application-oriented autonomous replicons for gene therapeutic treatments. This review will focus on the development of non-viral episomal vectors, their use in gene therapeutic applications and our current knowledge about their epigenetic regulation.", "citation_paragraph": "Over the last few years many clinical gene therapy trials with beneficial results for patients have taken place. However, during these trials severe problems became obvious with regard to safety aspects of the technologies used.In most gene therapy trials being virus-based vectors, such as adenoviral and retroviral vectors, have been mainly used for the delivery of genetic material to the cells (1) . Owing to their high transduction efficiency these vectors have been found to have broad applications in gene therapeutic treatments; even so, the appliance of these viral vectors is not without safety risks (2) . Despite their steady improvement they can still lead to insertional mutagenesis when integrating into the host genome or can induce immunological reactions in the recipient organism. Therefore, the use of viral vectors in gene therapy approaches is recommended only after a careful risk-benefit analysis.Non-viral, autonomous replicating vectors are considered to be a safe alternative but owing to their low efficiency they have not yet been used routinely in gene therapy trials (3) . Therefore, it is of immense importance to understand the underlying regulatory mechanisms involved in the establishment, replication and stability of autonomous replicons. Recently, the relevance of epigenetic parameters, such as chromatin structure, interplay between transcription and nuclear localization, has been analyzed in various organisms demonstrating that epigenetic factors play an important role in regulating DNA replication in higher organisms. In budding yeast, origin licensing is determined by the binding of the origin recognition complex (ORC) to a specific DNA sequence, which has been identified as autonomously replicating sequence (ARS). In contrast, the primary sequence of DNA alone is not sufficient for origin licensing in higher eukaryotic cells. Metazoan origins exhibit an extended structure and replication can be initiated at several different locations within (4) . Moreover, in these cells cell cycledependent alterations of histone modifications and nucleosomal remodeling have been shown to regulate prereplication factor assembly. Furthermore, recent studies provide evidence that cellular differentiation of embryonic stem cells is accompanied by controlled changes in replication timing, transcription and nuclear localization (5) .Therefore, understanding the epigenetic regulation of replication is essential for the rational design of episomally replicating vectors. This should not only lead to vector improvement but might also provide new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of replication. In this review, we will first summarize the main characteristics of eukaryotic origins of replication followed by discussing recent experiments that address progress towards understanding the epigenetic regulation of replication. We will then focus on advances in the construction of autonomous replicons used as model systems in basic cell and molecular biology, as well as in gene therapeutic applications.", "citance": "Furthermore, recent studies provide evidence that cellular differentiation of embryonic stem cells is accompanied by controlled changes in replication timing, transcription and nuclear localization (5) .Therefore, understanding the epigenetic regulation of replication is essential for the rational design of episomally replicating vectors.", "claims": [{"text": "Cellular differentiation of embryonic stem cells is accompanied by changes in replication timing, transcription and nuclear localization.", "subject": "Cellular differentiation", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Understanding epigenetic regulation of replication is essential for the reational design of episomally replicating vectors.", "subject": "epigenetic regulation", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 493279, "title": "Effect of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and Immunomodulator on Cytokines Levels: An Alternative Therapy for Patients with Major Depressive Disorder", "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a psychiatric illness that presents as a deficit of serotonergic neurotransmission in the central nervous system. MDD patients also experience alterations in cortisol and cytokines levels. Treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is the first-line antidepressant regimen for MDD. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of a combination of SSRIs and an immunomodulator-human dialyzable leukocyte extract (hDLE)-on cortisol and cytokines levels. Patients received SSRIs or SSRIs plus hDLE. The proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 \u03b2 , IL-2, and IFN- \u03b3 ; anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-13 and IL-10; and 24-h urine cortisol were measured at weeks (W) 0, 5, 20, 36, and 52 of treatment. The reduction in cortisol levels in the SSRI-treated group was 30% until W52, in contrast, the combined treatment induced a 54% decrease at W36. The decline in cortisol in patients who were treated with SSRI plus hDLE correlated with reduction of anti-inflammatory cytokines and increases levels of proinflammatory cytokines at the study conclusion. These results suggest that the immune-stimulating activity of hDLE, in combination with SSRIs, restored the pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine balance and cortisol levels in depressed patients versus those who were given SSRIs alone.", "citation_paragraph": "SSRIs also target cells of the immune system. A wide range of cytokineproducing cells constitutively express cortisol and the serotonin receptors 5-HT 1A, 5-HT 2A, 5-HT 1B, and 5-HT 3 [29, 45, 46] . Serotonin receptors activate cAMP-dependent pathways and mediate synthesis and release of cytokines and cellular proliferation [9] . Cortisol modulates cytokine gene transcription and lymphocyte proliferation. Studies of dexamethasone have reported alterations in GR in leukocytes of depressed patients, such as decreased nuclear translocation [47] and cellular proliferation [48] . In addition, lymphocytes from MDD patients have a lower density of 5-HTT [49] and impaired 5-HT 1A receptor functions [45, 46] .Variations in cortisol and serotonin concentrations can directly affect cytokine-producing cells and modulate the pattern of cytokine release [50] . We have reported an antiinflammatory cytokine profile in MDD patients before pharmacological treatment [20, 21] . In this study, MDD patients had significantly higher IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 levels at W0 versus healthy volunteers and lower proinflammatory cytokine levels (IL-1 , IFN-, and IL-2) .The immune system responds to stressful stimuli by secreting proinflammatory cytokines [51] , but when the rise in stress becomes chronic, the cytokines that are produced by immune cells activate the HPA axis, stimulating the adrenal cortex to synthesize and release glucocorticoids, which ultimately suppress proinflammatory gene expression [34] . For example, glucocorticoids upregulate IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 production and can induce immunosuppression with higher and sustained glucocorticoid secretion.Previous studies are consistent with our data, in which clinical assays have shown changes in the balance of pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines in patients with MDD without pharmacological treatment [21] and lower IFN-and IL-2 levels [52] . Moreover, suicidal depressed patients have a proinflammatory cytokine profile, whereas no such patients have an anti-inflammatory profile [53] ; in our study, an exclusion criterion was the presence of suicidal ideation. Notably, in vitro studies have reported that high levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-4, are associated with elevated cortisol and can impede the capture of 5-HT [32] , significantly downregulating cytokines, such as IL-2 and IFN-, in MDD patients [21] , acting primarily through immunological antagonism between pro-and antiinflammatory cytokines.Antidepressants increased serotonin levels in MDD patients, inducing clinical remission at W20, as assessed by HDRS and BDI scores. At this time point, IL-2 and IFN-levels rose significantly compared with W0 although there were no substantial changes in cortisol levels between SSRIs alone and SSRIs plus hDLEs, which increased the levels of these cytokines and decreased cortisol levels; this reduction was maintained until the end of treatment. The rise in proinflammatory cytokines might be attributed to the immunostimulatory action of serotonin. Studies have demonstrated that the effects of serotonin on the immune response are dose dependent-proinflammatory cytokine secretion and cellular proliferation occur at physiological serotonin concentrations (0.15 to 1.5 g/mL of serotonin), whereas such secretion declines at supraphysiological doses (15 g/mL) [50, 54] .These findings contrast with other reports, in which SSRIs decreased proinflammatory cytokine levels in MDD patients [55] , which might be due to the time of administration of SSRIs (our study followed up for 52 weeks versus 6 weeks in other studies), the patient demographics (gender, ethnic group, and family history), or depression subtypes [56] . Throughout the administration of SSRIs and SSRIs plus hDLEs, proinflammatory cytokine levels differed in MDD patients. At W20, the SSRI group and SSRI plus hDLE group experienced the largest increase of IFN-and IL-1 ; whereas the latter maintained such levels to W52, the levels in the SSRIs group were comparable with those of healthy volunteers.In contrast, IL-1 levels in the SSRIs group remained higher until the end of treatment, and IL-1 decreased, approximating levels in healthy volunteers. IL-2 levels climbed in the SSRI and SSRI plus hDLE groups until W36, which remained elevated until the end of treatment. At W52, the SSRI group had lower IL-1 levels versus at W0.As discussed, SSRIs increase circulating levels of plasma serotonin [35] , the physiological doses of which can upregulate IL-1 and IFN-secretion [50] . This evidence could explain the rise in proinflammatory cytokines in both patient groups.DLEs have immunomodulatory and immunostimulatory effects in various infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, and cancers [57] [58] [59] . The coadministration of SSRIs and hDLEs increased IL-1 , IL-2, and IFN-levels. In addition, in vitro studies have shown that hDLEs induce IFN-secretion in Jurkat cells [23] . The mechanism underlying the effects of hEDL still not elucidate, but certain peptides are recognized by innate immune receptors, such as TLRs, on macrophages, B cells, and dendritic cells [60, 61] . These antigen-presenting cells might present hEDL peptides to T cells and induce the release of proinflammatory cytokines.In our study, MDD patients had an anti-inflammatory cytokine profile that was associated with increased cortisol levels before treatment. Healthy volunteers had undetectable levels of IL-4. SSRIs and SSRIs plus hDLEs downregulated IL-10 and IL-13, but SSRIs failed to reduce the increased levels of IL-4. Notably, in vitro studies have linked high levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-4, to elevated cortisol, which can inhibit the capture of 5-HT [32] , causing a significant decrease in cytokines, such as IL-2 and IFN-, in MDD patients. In the SSRI-plus-hDLE group, IL-4 levels were not detected during clinical followup.At W52, patients who were given SSRIs and hDLEs experienced a decline in IL-10 and IL-13 to comparable levels in healthy volunteers. In contrast, SSRI-treated patients showed significant variations in IL-10 and IL-13 levels versus healthy volunteers at W52.Limitations. The limitations of our study are the small sample size and open-label study design without placebo control group. In addition the total scores of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) showed no significant changes between treatments but will be necessary to analyze if the assessment of each \"symptom cluster of HDRS\" (anxiety, affective, or somatic symptoms) is associated to molecular variations detected in this study.Clinical and Developmental Immunology 9", "citance": "The mechanism underlying the effects of hEDL still not elucidate, but certain peptides are recognized by innate immune receptors, such as TLRs, on macrophages, B cells, and dendritic cells [60, 61] .", "claims": [{"text": "Certain immunomodulator-human dialyzable leukocyte extract (hDLE) peptides are recognized by toll-like receptors (TLRs) on macrophages and dendritic cells.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 58632886, "title": "Developments in bile salt based therapies: A critical overview", "abstract": "Graphical abstract Figure. No Caption available. ABSTRACT Bile acids, amphipathic molecules known for their facilitating role in fat absorption, are also recognized as signalling molecules acting via nuclear and membrane receptors. Of the bile acid\u2010activated receptors, the Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) and the G protein\u2010coupled bile acid receptor\u20101 (Gpbar1 or TGR5) have been studied most extensively. Bile acid signaling is critical in the regulation of bile acid metabolism itself, but it also plays a significant role in glucose, lipid and energy metabolism. Activation of FXR and TGR5 leads to reduced hepatic bile salt load, improved insulin sensitivity and glucose regulation, increased energy expenditure, and anti\u2010inflammatory effects. These beneficial effects render bile acid signaling an interesting therapeutic target for the treatment of diseases such as cholestasis, non\u2010alcoholic fatty liver disease, and diabetes. Here, we summarize recent findings on bile acid signaling and discuss potential and current limitations of bile acid receptor agonist and modulators of bile acid transport as future therapeutics for a wide\u2010spectrum of diseases.", "citation_paragraph": "The role of TGR5 in glucose metabolism, energy expenditure and inflammation renders it a potential therapeutic target for the metabolic syndrome and T2D, which stimulated the development and patented registration of hundreds of selective TGR5 agonists [133] . Especially the compound INT-777 has been studied extensively with remarkable in vivo effects on GLP-1 secretion, glycemic control, energy expenditure, and adiposity thereby attenuating obesity and T2D in mice [61, 134] . However, to date only one selective TGR5 agonist has been tested in a clinical trial, executed almost 10 years ago (NCT00733577). In this study the compound SB-756050, was administered daily to subjects with T2D for 6 days [135] . Based on earlier results in (diabetic) rats and dogs, dose-dependent increases on GLP-1 and peptide YY (PYY) were expected, consequently resulting in an overall improvement of the glucose profiles of the subjects. In contrast, subjects administered with the two lowest doses of 15 and 50 mg SB-756050 had increased fasting glucose levels and higher glucose levels during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Subjects administered with the high doses of 100 and 200 mg did not show any changes on glucose levels and OGTT performance. GLP-1 and PYY levels were only changed at the higher doses, potentially via activation of the L-cells in the distal ileum and colon by the unabsorbed part of the drug. No adverse events were reported, but the high variability of the study outcomes and activation site of the drug needs further investigation.The plant-derived triterpenoid OA, which was reported to be a TGR5 agonist, improved glycemic control in obese mice [124] and attenuated plasma triglycerides in hyperlipidemic patients [127] . However, the triterpenoids are not selective TGR5 agonists, which warrants careful interpretation of these studies.The question rises why clinical application of TGR5 targeted therapy has thus far not been realized, despite abundant positive reports of pharmacological TGR5 activation in rodents. The reason for this restraint are several major drawbacks considered to be associated with TGR5 activation, namely increased gallstone formation, pruritus, cardiovascular side effects and tumorigenesis. Genetic deletion of TGR5 has been reported to protect mice against gallstones [36] and pancreatitis [136] , whilst administration of TGR5 agonists has been demonstrated to stimulate gallbladder filling, likely caused by TGR5-dependent relaxation of smooth muscle cells [137] . It is uncertain whether TGR5 stimulation directly predisposes to cholesterol gallstone formation, but decreased gallbladder motility has been associated with the presence of gallstones [7] . Bile acid-induced pruritus has also been linked to TGR5, as was shown by itch and analgesia transmitter release by mouse dorsal route ganglia and spinal cord neurons in response to bile acids and a TGR5-selective agonist, as well as by increased scratching and spontaneous pruritus in TGR5 transgenic mice [138] . Furthermore, one study reported on a prominent reduction in blood pressure and reflex tachycardia in dogs after infusion with several different TGR5 agonists, likely caused by TGR5 activation in endothelial cells [139] . The final major drawback of TGR5 agonism might be the controversial role of TGR5 in proliferation and tumorigenesis. In both in vitro and in vivo models it was shown that TGR5 plays a key role in cholangiocyte proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis, thereby increasing the risk of cholangiocarcinoma [140] . Furthermore, TGR5 expression has been linked to esophageal adenocarcinoma in patients [141] and in vitro studies demonstrated increased growth rates of both esophageal adenocarcinoma cells and gastric cancer cells upon TGR5 activation [142, 143] . Although most deleterious effects associated with TGR5 have been observed in vitro or in animal studies, and therefore might not accurately predict the effects in humans, the predicted risks presumably influences the slow transition of selective TGR5 agonists towards clinical practice.Instead of synthetic TGR5 agonists bile salts themselves have been employed to stimulate GLP-1 release via TGR5 activation. Several clinical trials have been executed with the bile salts ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), CDCA, and taurocholic acid (TCA) (NCT01337440, NCT01666223). UDCA treatment for 12 weeks augmented the sitagliptin-induced boost of GLP-1 secretion and reduced body weight and HbA1c levels in T2D patients [144] . Rectal infusion of TCA promptly stimulated GLP-1 and PYY secretion [145] , and intragastric infusion of CDCA increased GLP-1 and glucagon levels [146] . Both CDCA and UDCA stimulated GLP-1 release in patients after bariatric surgery [147] .The ability of bile acids to increase energy expenditure in brown adipose tissue via TGR5 activation [60] is also emerging as potential therapeutic target. Preclinically, both CA and CDCA feeding reversed obesity via TGR5-mediated enhanced energy expenditure in brown adipose tissue [60, 148] . In humans, CDCA treatment of healthy volunteers for 2 days increased brown adipose tissue activity which resulted in increased whole-body energy expenditure [149] . Although it might be discussed if these study results can selectively be ascribed to TGR5 agonism alone, especially CDCA is in fact a stronger FXR agonist, these studies do highlight the potential of bile acid based therapies as treatment of the metabolic syndrome and T2D.", "citance": "In humans, CDCA treatment of healthy volunteers for 2 days increased brown adipose tissue activity which resulted in increased whole-body energy expenditure [149] .", "claims": [{"text": "Chenodeosycholic acid treatment increases whole-body energy expenditure.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Chenodeosycholic acid treatment reduces whole-body energy expenditure.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Chenodeoxycholic acid treatment decreases brown adipose tissue activity.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Chenodeoxycholic acid treatment increases brown adipose tissue activity.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

To address this two cross-sectional surveys in 2015\u20132016: one among genitourinary medicine (GUM) and non-GUM HCPs (n = 109) and the other among YP attending a GUM clinic in England (n = 195). For both, questions were designed to measure awareness of NCSP guidance and whether respondents acted on that knowledge. This included questions about YP\u2019s most recent test(s) (if ever) and the time since first and last sex with their most recent partners. Knowledge of NCSP testing guidelines varied among both GUM and non-GUM HCP respondents. However, lack of knowledge of the guidelines did not preclude HCPs from recommending testing in line with NCSP recommendations in practice. While most YP were not aware of NCSP recommendations, around two-thirds had tested for Chlamydia at least once in the last year. However, testing seldom appeared to coincide with partnership change. There is a knowledge gap and a discord between testing recommendations and practice. Interventions are needed to encourage appropriate testing patterns to maximise the individual and public health benefits of testing.", "citation_paragraph": "Chlamydia trachomatis is the most commonly diagnosed bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the UK with over 200,000 people diagnosed in 2016. 1 The greatest prevalence of infection is found among sexually-experienced 16-24 year olds (3.1% in women; 2.3% in men) 2 with the majority of those infected experiencing no symptoms. 3 Left untreated, Chlamydia can cause significant and costly adverse reproductive health problems including ectopic pregnancy and infertility. 3 Transmission may also occur to sexual partners and to the neonate. 3 In England, the National Chlamydia Screening Programme (NCSP) was introduced in 2003 with the aims of preventing and controlling Chlamydia through the detection and prompt treatment of infection in people aged 15-24 years. Reinfection among young people (YP) who have been treated for Chlamydia is estimated to be 10-30%. 4 As a result, the NCSP advises that all sexually-active men and women under the age of 25 are tested annually, on change of sexual partner and three months following treatment. 5 Adherence to NCSP guidelines is monitored through local, regional and national audit and surveillance systems.NCSP aims to deliver high volume, high-quality screening to YP by embedding Chlamydia screening within primary care and sexual health services. The NCSP encourages commissioners and providers to use core services including: sexual and reproductive health services; internet testing; general practice; abortion services and community pharmacies.Appropriate testing in accordance with the NCSP recommendations may require knowledge of these recommendations among healthcare professionals (HCPs) and YP as well as the feeling that a test is needed in relation to sexual activity. There is little understanding of the testing patterns of YP in relation to the timing of sex with partners. For example, during a sexual health consultation, sexually-active YP will be asked when they last had sex, and the number of partners in the last three months will be documented. However, the timing of sexual health screens in relation to changes in partners is often undocumented. Individuals may have two or more sexual partnerships at a time (concurrency) which further adds to the challenges of understanding patterns of testing in relation to sexual partner change. 2 Timing of testing is crucial for the prevention of transmission and prevention of sequelae, as treatment after transmission events, or after upper reproductive tract damage has occurred, will have much less benefit for the same cost.

{"s2orc_id": 1653230, "title": "Addressing the Future Burden of Cancer and Its Impact on the Oncology Workforce: Where Is Cancer Prevention and Control?", "abstract": "The need for cancer professionals has never been more urgent than it is today. Reports project serious shortages by 2020 of oncology health care providers. Although many plans have been proposed, no role for prevention has been described. In response, a 2-day symposium was held in 2009 at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to capture the current status of the cancer prevention workforce and begin to identify gaps in the workforce. Five working groups were organized around the following topic areas: (a) health policy and advocacy; (b) translation to the community; (c) integrating cancer prevention into clinical practice; (d) health services infrastructure and economics; and (e) discovery, research, and technology. Along with specific recommendations on these topics, the working groups identified two additional major themes: the difficulty of defining areas within the field (including barriers to communication) and lack of sufficient funding. These interdependent issues synergistically impede progress in preventing cancer; they are explored in detail in this synthesis, and recommendations for actions to address them are presented. Progress in cancer prevention should be a major national and international goal. To achieve this goal, ensuring the health of the workforce in cancer prevention and control is imperative.", "citation_paragraph": "Poor communication affects the cancer prevention workforce in several ways. First, awareness of the career opportunities in the field of cancer prevention is lacking among both students and those who provide career advice to them. Most students are aware of careers in medicine, nursing, and public health practice, as well as of careers in biological, public health, and behavioral science research, but many may not connect these careers with opportunities in cancer prevention. Research on the Millenial generation suggests that young people obtain information about careers and make career decisions differently than previous generations, with a focus on initial searches through the Internet, a preference for \"branded\" employers and direct contact with decision-makers in target organizations, and a strong preference for individualized, tailored career development assistance. Because students ignorant of career opportunities in cancer prevention will not seek them out, raising the profile of cancer prevention careers is vital. Unfortunately, exposure of health professional students to cancer prevention careers during training remains low. For example, over the past 20 years since efforts by the American Association for Cancer Education have sought to assess and integrate cancer prevention education into undergraduate medical education, and in spite of recommendations by the IOM [13] , recent review of medical school curricula suggests only modest success achieved [14] . Improved efforts to raise awareness among medical students could have potent impact, as 57% of entering oncology fellows surveyed by ASCO reported deciding to pursue oncology before residency [15] . Medical school represents a critical window of opportunity for influencing physician career choices, as oncology competes with other subspecialties for those boarded in internal medicine [16] . Using a variety of strategies, including new methods of communication (e.g., social media), students must be engaged more effectively and exposed to cancer prevention careers earlier in their education.For those already interested in cancer prevention careers, part of the problem may be structural, in that no clear career path into the field exists for students to follow. For example, no specialty or subspecialty is currently dedicated to providing training in cancer prevention. Medical students hoping to pursue accredited post-graduate medical training relevant to clinical cancer prevention are limited to choosing either preventive medicine specialty, which does not focus exclusively on cancer, or internal medicine subspecialty in oncology, which does not focus exclusively on prevention.Some learn about cancer prevention later in their careers, sometimes after years of practice in basic science and clinical work in oncology. If knowledge of careers in cancer prevention comes later during the training trajectory, fatigue from lengthy training or lack of interest in returning to status as students or trainees may deter some, even if they are interested in careers in cancer prevention.

{"s2orc_id": 14676967, "title": "Eating the Dead to Keep Atherosclerosis at Bay", "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is the primary cause of coronary heart disease (CHD), ischemic stroke, and peripheral arterial disease. Despite effective lipid-lowering therapies and prevention programs, atherosclerosis is still the leading cause of mortality in the United States. Moreover, the prevalence of CHD in developing countries worldwide is rapidly increasing at a rate expected to overtake those of cancer and diabetes. Prominent risk factors include the hardening of arteries and high levels of cholesterol, which lead to the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. However, cell death and efferocytosis are critical components of both atherosclerotic plaque progression and regression, yet, few currently available therapies focus on these processes. Thus, understanding the causes of cell death within the atherosclerotic plaque, the consequences of cell death, and the mechanisms of apoptotic cell clearance may enable the development of new therapies to treat cardiovascular disease. Here, we review how endoplasmic reticulum stress and cholesterol metabolism lead to cell death and inflammation, how dying cells affect plaque progression, and how autophagy and the clearance of dead cells ameliorates the inflammatory environment of the plaque. In addition, we review current research aimed at alleviating these processes and specifically targeting therapeutics to the site of the plaque.", "citation_paragraph": "Historically, the role of VSMCs in atherosclerosis has been simple: their proliferation promotes plaque formation and their production of collagen, which expands the extracellular matrix of the endothelium and forms the fibrous cap (99) . However, recent studies suggest a far more complex role for these cells in the progression of atherosclerosis. Several studies have shown that cultured VSMCs could gain a macrophage-like phenotype while losing expression of characteristic VSMC markers as evidenced by co-staining of smooth muscle actin (SMA) and CD68 (macrophage marker) in human atherosclerotic lesions (100-103). However, these studies were unable to determine if these cells were of smooth muscle origin or not. A genetic inducible fate-mapping study using ApoE null mice in which smooth muscle cells and their progeny exhibited \u03b2-galactosidase activity used both Western blot and tissue staining to demonstrate the upregulation of macrophage markers MAC-2 and CD68 and downregulation of smooth muscle cell markers SMA and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain with concomitant \u03b2-galactosidase activity in cultured VSMCs derived from atherosclerotic aortas compared to non-atherosclerotic aortas (104) . A second smooth muscle cell lineage tracing study showed that over 80% of VSMCs, approximately 30% of total cells, within atherosclerotic lesions are undetectable using conventional SMA staining. These cells undergo a phenotypic transition within the lesion to a more macrophage-like phenotype. Furthermore, the loss of KLF4 within SMCs resulted in a reduction of VSMCs with a macrophage-like phenotype within the lesion in addition to reduced lesion size and reduced fibrous cap thickness. This study also elucidated a role for VSMCs in foam cell formation. Upon cholesterol loading, KLF4 expression and expression of macrophage markers were induced in VSMCs resulting in phagocytic behavior and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (105) . Much like macrophages, these phenotypically altered VSMCs exhibit expression of SR-As, CD36, and LOX-1 and downregulation of ABCA1 and ABCG1 indicating increased oxLDL uptake and reduced cholesterol efflux resulting in foam cell formation (106) (107) (108) . Furthermore, oxLDL has been shown to activate the TLR4-mediated inflammatory signaling pathway in VSMCs. This results in the upregulation of ACAT1 expression further promoting intracellular lipid accumulation and foam cell formation (109) . These lipid-laden VSMCs can also undergo cholesterol-induced cell death resulting in the release of MCP-1, fractalkine, and other pro-inflammatory cytokines that recruit monocytes, promoting further VSMC phenotype switching, and enhancing plaque development (110) . Given the similarities between these phenotypically altered VSMCs and macrophages, it is probable that the same mechanisms lead to cell death, namely ER stress, and dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism and autophagy. Furthermore, VSMCs likely play a significant role in plaque progression by contributing to the foam cell formation, cell death, and necrotic core formation within the plaque.", "citance": "Upon cholesterol loading, KLF4 expression and expression of macrophage markers were induced in VSMCs resulting in phagocytic behavior and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (105) .", "claims": [{"text": "Cholesterol loading induces KLF4 expression in VSMCs, resulting in phagocytic behavior.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Cholesterol loading induces KLF4 expression in VSMCs, resulting in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Cholesterol loading suppresses KLF4 expression in VSMCs.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}

The cellular and molecular factors underlying this observation are only partially understood. Recent studies suggest that chronic Plasmodium falciparum exposure may induce functional exhaustion of lymphocytes, potentially impeding optimal control of infection. However, it remains unclear whether the \"atypical\" memory B cells (MBCs) and \"exhausted\" CD4 T cells described in humans exposed to endemic malaria are driven by P. falciparum per se or by other factors commonly associated with malaria, such as coinfections and malnutrition. To address this critical question we took advantage of a \"natural\" experiment near Kilifi, Kenya, and compared profiles of B and T cells of children living in a rural community where P. falciparum transmission is ongoing to the profiles of age-matched children living under similar conditions in a nearby community where P. falciparum transmission ceased 5 y prior to this study. We found that continuous exposure to P. falciparum drives the expansion of atypical MBCs. Persistent P. falciparum exposure was associated with an increased frequency of CD4 T cells expressing phenotypic markers of exhaustion, both programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) alone and PD-1 in combination with lymphocyte-activation gene-3 (LAG-3). This expansion of PD-1-expressing and PD-1/LAG-3-coexpressing CD4 T cells was largely confined to CD45RA(+) CD4 T cells. The percentage of CD45RA(+)CD27(+) CD4 T cells coexpressing PD-1 and LAG-3 was inversely correlated with frequencies of activated and classical MBCs. Taken together, these results suggest that P. falciparum infection per se drives the expansion of atypical MBCs and phenotypically exhausted CD4 T cells, which has been reported in other endemic areas.", "citation_paragraph": "L ongstanding and compelling evidence points to a critical role for Abs (1, 2) and CD4 T cells (3) (4) (5) in mediating naturally acquired immunity to the erythrocytic stages of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in humans. However, immunity to P. falciparum infection is relatively slow to develop and is probably never sterile (6) (7) (8) . The mechanisms underlying these observations are only partially understood. Additionally, it is unclear why otherwise promising experimental malaria vaccine candidates (9-11) subsequently fail to protect, or only partially protect, residents of malaria-endemic areas (12) . Although it is likely that antigenic variation and allelic diversity play an important role in these observations (13) (14) (15) , recent studies suggest that chronic P. falciparum exposure induces qualitative changes in B and T cell responses that may also play a role in P. falciparum immune evasion.Indeed, functional \"exhaustion\" (immune dysfunction) among T and B cell subsets is a well-described feature of chronic viral infections, such as hepatitis B and C and HIV viruses (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) . T cell exhaustion was initially described for CD8 T cells in mice chronically infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus clone 13 (21) . In the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus mouse model, repeated Ag stimulation through the T cell Ag receptor drives the sustained expression of T cell inhibitory receptors, including programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3), on virus-specific CD8 T cells. Sustained signaling through these inhibitory receptors directly and indirectly induces transcriptional changes that negatively regulate proliferation and the expression of proinflammatory cytokines by virusspecific CD8 T cells (22, 23) . T cell exhaustion was subsequently described in humans in the context of chronic viral infections, such as HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) as well as in the context of cancer (16, 17, 19) .Regarding B cell exhaustion, Moir et al. (24) recently demonstrated that HIV viremia is associated with an expanded subset of memory B cells (MBCs) that had previously been defined by the expression of the inhibitory receptor FcR-like-4 (FCRL4) (25) , representing on average 19% of total peripheral blood B cells, compared with ,4% in healthy individuals. B cells with a similar phenotype have also been identified in individuals infected with HCV (26) . It was demonstrated that this subset of B cells in HIVinfected individuals had undergone isotype class switching and somatic hypermutation, but compared with naive B cells and classical MBCs, FCRL4 + MBCs proliferated less well in response to BCR crosslinking and/or CD40L and TLR9 agonist CpG and showed a decreased ability to differentiate into Ab-secreting cells in response to CpG and the polyclonal activator Staphylococcus aureus Cowan (24) . FCRL4 + MBCs in HIV-viremic individuals (24) also express high levels of inhibitory receptors and a profile of lymphoid-homing receptors similar to what is expressed on exhausted CD8 T cells during chronic viral infections (27) . Owing to the relative hyporesponsiveness of these MBCs and their altered expression of inhibitory and homing receptors that together are signatures for virus-induced exhaustion of T cells (27) (28) (29) , Moir et al. (24) referred to this subset of MBCs as \"exhausted.\" Exhausted MBCs were disproportionately HIV-specific as compared with the classical MBC compartment; in contrast, influenzaspecific MBCs were more prevalent in the classical MBC compartment. These authors proposed that chronic HIV stimulation of B cells leads to their premature exhaustion, contributing to the poor Ab responses in HIV-infected individuals (30) . In contrast, Ehrhardt et al. (25) , who first described FCRL4 + \"tissue-like\" MBCs in lymphoid tissues of healthy individuals, suggested that these cells might play a protective role during infection.It is conceivable that chronic P. falciparum exposure in malariaendemic areas would also be associated with T and B exhaustion and thus contribute to the protracted acquisition of malaria immunity, but few studies have explored this possibility. Butler et al. (31) recently reported that natural P. falciparum infection in Malian children resulted in higher expression of the inhibitory receptor PD-1 on CD4 T cells. In the same report it was shown that nonlethal Plasmodium yoelii infection induces CD4 T cell exhaustion and that in vivo blockade of the PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) and the inhibitory receptor LAG-3 restored CD4 T cell function, amplified the number of follicular helper T cells and germinal center B cells and plasmablasts, and enhanced protective Abs and rapid clearance of blood-stage malaria in mice (31) , thus suggesting that the increase in PD-1-expressing CD4 T cells in P. falciparum-exposed Malian children may reflect functional exhaustion, but that has yet to be determined. Recent studies in Mali, Gambia, and Peru also indicate that P. falciparum exposure is associated with an expansion of a phenotypically distinct population of MBCs identified by the cell surface markers CD19+ CD20 + CD21 2 CD27 2 CD102 (32-36), similar to the exhausted MBCs described in individuals infected with HIV (24) and HCV (26) . Similar to HIV, this MBC subset in the context of malaria expresses high levels of inhibitory receptors and a profile of lymphoid-homing receptors (35) . Given that the function of FCRL4 + MBCs in P. falciparum-exposed individuals remains unknown, this B cell subset has been referred to as \"atypical\" rather than exhausted in the context of malaria (35) .Importantly, in the absence of P. falciparum Ag-specific B and T cell data, it remains unclear whether the atypical MBCs and putatively exhausted CD4 T cells reported from P. falciparumendemic areas are driven by P. falciparum infection per se or by other factors commonly associated with P. falciparum transmission, such as coinfections, malnutrition, or genetic polymorphisms (34, 35) . To address this critical question, we took advantage of a \"natural\" experiment near Kilifi, Kenya, and compared B and T cell profiles of children living in a rural community where P. falciparum transmission is ongoing to those of age-matched children, living under similar conditions in a nearby community where P. falciparum transmission ceased 5 y prior to this study. We observed a higher frequency of atypical MBCs and PD-1/ LAG-3-coexpressing CD4 T cells in children exposed to ongoing P. falciparum transmission, thus providing the strongest evidence yet that P. falciparum infection per se drives the phenotypic changes in B and T cells that may be indicative of functional exhaustion.", "citance": "These authors proposed that chronic HIV stimulation of B cells leads to their premature exhaustion, contributing to the poor Ab responses in HIV-infected individuals (30) .", "claims": [{"text": "Chronic HIV stimulation of B cells leads to the premature exhaustion of B cells.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Exhaustion of B cells contributes to poor Ab response in HIV-infected individuals.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 10659658, "title": "Cytochrome P450-generated metabolites derived from \u03c9-3 fatty acids attenuate neovascularization.", "abstract": "Ocular neovascularization, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), is a primary cause of blindness in individuals of industrialized countries. With a projected increase in the prevalence of these blinding neovascular diseases, there is an urgent need for new pharmacological interventions for their treatment or prevention. Increasing evidence has implicated eicosanoid-like metabolites of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) in the regulation of neovascular disease. In particular, metabolites generated by the cytochrome P450 (CYP)-epoxygenase pathway have been shown to be potent modulators of angiogenesis, making this pathway a reasonable previously unidentified target for intervention in neovascular ocular disease. Here we show that dietary supplementation with \u03c9-3 LCPUFAs promotes regression of choroidal neovessels in a well-characterized mouse model of neovascular AMD. Leukocyte recruitment and adhesion molecule expression in choroidal neovascular lesions were down-regulated in mice fed \u03c9-3 LCPUFAs. The serum of these mice showed increased levels of anti-inflammatory eicosanoids derived from eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. 17,18-epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid and 19,20-epoxydocosapentaenoic acid, the major CYP-generated metabolites of these primary \u03c9-3 LCPUFAs, were identified as key lipid mediators of disease resolution. We conclude that CYP-derived bioactive lipid metabolites from \u03c9-3 LCPUFAs are potent inhibitors of intraocular neovascular disease and show promising therapeutic potential for resolution of neovascular AMD.", "citation_paragraph": "We have shown that the primary \u03c9-3 LCPUFAs, EPA and DHA, promote vascular regression in a manner dependent in part on the CYP epoxygenase pathway. The \u03c9-3 LCPUFAs (and their CYP-generated metabolites) reduced disease severity by suppressing conditions favorable to both angiogenesis and leukocyte recruitment (Fig. S7) . Mice fed \u03c9-3 LCPUFAs showed generally increased circulating levels of EPA-and DHA-derived CYP eicosanoids (EEQs and EDPs), whereas the levels of AA-derived proangiogenic EETs were reduced significantly. We identified two specific bioactive products (17,18-EEQ and 19,20-EDP) as being important for disease resolution in a mouse model of neovascular AMD. We also show that mice fed an \u03c9-3 LCPUFA diet manifest greater Ppar\u03b3 expression and activity in the retina or choroid than seen in their counterparts fed \u03c9-6 LCPUFA and that the effect of \u03c9-3 LCPUFAs on the size of CNV lesions is blocked by a specific inhibitor of Ppar\u03b3. The recruitment of circulating immune cells to CNV lesions was dampened significantly in mice receiving \u03c9-3 LCPUFAs. In these mice, expression of the key endothelial adhesion molecules Icam-1 and E-selectin was downregulated significantly in the choroidal vasculature, and the ICAM-1 ligand CD11b-CD18 was suppressed on circulating PBLs.We found that administration of the CYP- and vascular leakage, indicating that enrichment of these metabolites in serum by dietary supplementation can reduce choroidal neovessel growth and pathology significantly. Up-regulation of these CYP-generated metabolites in serum was observed previously in rats and man after dietary EPA/DHA supplementation (21, 23) . EETs, EDPs, and EEQs are synthesized by the same CYP enzymes in both hepatic and extrahepatic tissues and act as second messengers with potent biological activities (7-9). Although we identified several CYP family members localized to the retina, further investigation is needed to determine how these enzymes are modulated both locally in the retina and systemically. This information should give us greater insight into how these CYPderived lipid metabolites are regulated in response to disease. Three distinct enzyme classes are responsible for the metabolism of LCPUFAs: CYP, COX, and LOX. EPA and DHA compete with AA for binding to and metabolism by these enzymes, with such competition affecting the production, bioactivity, and bioavailability of epoxides, prostanoids, and leukotrienes, respectively. Chronic aspirin administration recently was shown to be associated with an increased risk of neovascular AMD (31) . Given the ability of aspirin to affect the formation of both \u03c9-3 and \u03c9-6 LCPUFA metabolites, such long-term aspirin use may influence leukocyte recruitment and angiogenesis.The bioactive \u03c9-3 LCPUFA-derived mediators neuroprotectin D, resolvin D1, and resolvin E1 suppress angiogenesis (16) . Neuroprotectin D, a potent anti-inflammatory molecule, was found to reduce the extent of clinically relevant vascular leakage in a mouse model of CNV (17) . Resolvin D1 and E1 dampen leukocyte responses and facilitate the resolution of inflammation (13) , and they also have been shown to attenuate angiogenesis associated with oxygen-induced retinopathy (16) . We have now identified additional \u03c9-3 LCPUFA derivatives, 17,18-EEQ and 19,20-EDP, that reduce the size of CNV lesions and suppress vascular leakage in a mouse model of CNV. CYPgenerated metabolites of \u03c9-3 LCPUFAs thus not only promote CNV resolution but also facilitate vascular repair and regression.Immune cell recruitment plays a key role in innate host responses including local inflammation (32) , neovascularization (33) , and wound healing (34) as well as in various diseases including inflammatory neurodegeneration (35) , atherosclerosis (36) , and cancer (13) . Our data now suggest that dietary intake of \u03c9-3 LCPUFAs results in functional down-regulation of both Icam-1 on endothelial cells and the ICAM-1 ligand on the surface of leukocytes and also suppresses macrophage invasion into CNV lesions.The results of three randomized, controlled, prospective cohort trials (37-39), four case-control studies (40) (41) (42) (43) , and two crosssectional studies (44, 45) showed that high dietary \u03c9-3 fatty acid intakes were associated with a 38% reduction in the risk of late AMD [odds ratio (OR): 0.62; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.48-0.82]. Eating fish at least twice a week was associated with a reduced risk of both early AMD (OR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.64-0.90) and late AMD (OR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.53-0.85) (46) . In contrast, two recent randomized, prospective, placebo-controlled, clinical trials tested the efficacy of \u03c9-3 supplementation on late AMD development and found no beneficial effect (47, 48) . In the National Institutes of Health-initiated Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) subjects were given supplements containing lutein plus zeaxanthin, \u03c9-3 LCPUFAs [DHA (350 mg) + EPA (650 mg) from ethyl esters], or both on top of the original AREDS formulation. It was found that \u03c9-3 supplementation did not reduce the 5-y risk of progression from early to late AMD (progression of either geographic atrophy or neovascular AMD was assessed) (47) . The Nutritional AMD Treatment 2 (NAT2) study found no effect with 3-y \u03c9-3 supplementation [DHA (840 mg) and EPA (270 mg) from fish oil] on neovascular AMD development in the unaffected eye from the patients with CNV in the contralateral eye (48) .We were able to impose strict dietary controls on our subject animals so that they had access only to either \u03c9-3 (DHA and EPA) or \u03c9-6 LCPUFAs during the experimental window (before disease onset and through the experimental end point). This dietary restriction to only \u03c9-3 or \u03c9-6 lipids was not possible in the supplemented AREDS2 and NAT2 study (47, 48) . Collectively these results indicate that dietary sources alone might not be sufficient to alter an individual's systemic lipid profile. Indeed, identification and subsequent administration of potent bioactive lipid metabolites may be critical to therapeutic treatment for a large majority of the population. Last, the AREDS2 and NAT2 studies comprised a population that generally consisted of highly educated and well-nourished individuals with an overall incidence of late AMD lower than expected from observational studies, and this study population already may have had adequate \u03c9-3 levels. The elevated \u03c9-3 serum levels of the placebo groups in both trials suggest this possibility and also might suggest that trial effects (e.g., self supplementation) might have reduced the power of the statistics in both randomized trials.A recent study showed that patients who were able to achieve a high EPA+DHA content in their red blood cell membranes (RBCM) had a significant (48%) reduction in the odds of developing neovascular AMD (43) . Interestingly, this effect also was observed in a subset of individuals in the NAT2 study, which found that patients with high EPA+DHA content in their RBCM were significantly protected from progression of neovascular disease (48) . The authors correctly conclude that RBCM lipid content is a more valid reflection of long-term incorporation of these lipids into tissues, because these lipids likely are introduced during hematopoiesis, whereas serum lipid profiles largely reflect recent, short-term dietary changes (43) . Unfortunately only serum profiles were assessed in AREDS2, so tissue incorporation could not be assessed (47) . These results suggest that incorporation of these lipids is vital to overall bioavailability and that therapeutic treatment with the downstream bioactive lipid metabolites could be of significant importance in individuals who are unable to achieve an elevated level of \u03c9-3s. However, given the high variability among individuals with different tissue-specific levels of EPA/DHA, dietary intake of \u03c9-3 LCPUFAs alone may not be sufficient to achieve protection against neovascular AMD. Therefore, identifying the bioactive lipid metabolites with antiangiogenic and anti-inflammatory functions, as defined in this study, is of significant interest for dietary nonresponders who may not be able to alter their tissue lipid metabolite profiles despite supplementation. In our animal models, we can regulate the diets tightly and therefore are able to draw strong conclusions on the actions of individual eicosanoids. Moreover, dietary incorporation of these lipids into tissues seems to occur largely in an age-dependent manner. This dependence is illustrated by our inability to shift the retinal tissue profile in the adult mice in our current study, in contrast with our earlier work, in which these lipids were incorporated readily into the retinas of neonatal mice (16) . Similarly, age-dependent alterations have been identified in a number of CYP isoforms (49) and could reflect how downstream lipid metabolite formation might change drastically with age, thereby providing an important clue into the pathogenesis of AMD development.In conclusion, we have found that CYP-generated metabolites of dietary \u03c9-3 LCPUFAs are responsible, at least in part, for attenuation of pathological angiogenesis in vivo. Importantly, this beneficial effect can be achieved with physiologically relevant increases in the dietary content of \u03c9-3 LCPUFAs. Although our studies were performed with a mouse model of AMD, our findings also may be relevant to other diseases in which angiogenesis and inflammation play key roles, including atherosclerosis, arthritis, and cancer.", "citance": "Chronic aspirin administration recently was shown to be associated with an increased risk of neovascular AMD (31) .", "claims": [{"text": "Chronic asprin administration is associated with a higher risk of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD).", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Chronic asprin administration is associated with a lower risk of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD).", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}

Although cilia house a number of oncogenic molecules (including Smoothened, KRAS, EGFR, and PDGFR), their precise role in cancer remains unclear. We have interrogated the role of cilia in acquired and de novo resistance to a variety of kinase inhibitors, and found that, in several examples, resistant cells are distinctly characterized by an increase in the number and/or length of cilia with altered structural features. Changes in ciliation seem to be linked to differences in the molecular composition of cilia and result in enhanced Hedgehog pathway activation. Notably, manipulating cilia length via Kif7 knockdown is sufficient to confer drug resistance in drug-sensitive cells. Conversely, targeting of cilia length or integrity through genetic and pharmacological approaches overcomes kinase inhibitor resistance. Our work establishes a role for ciliogenesis and cilia length in promoting cancer drug resistance and has significant translational implications.", "citation_paragraph": "Primary cilia are microtubule-based sensory organelles that detect mechanical and chemical stimuli, and are formed by nearly all vertebrate cells (Garcia-Gonzalo and Reiter, 2012) . These antenna-like organelles house a number of oncogenic molecules including Smoothened, KRAS (Lauth et al., 2010) , epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) (reviewed in Christensen et al., 2012) . Although loss of cilia has been associated with the onset of malignancy in some human tumors (reviewed in Basten and Giles, 2013) , in others, cilia appear to be necessary for cancer cell survival (Han et al., 2009; Wong et al., 2009; Li et al., 2016) . In fact, depending on the nature of the driver oncogenic lesion, cilia can have opposing roles in tumorigenesis even in the same tumor type. For example, removal of cilia inhibited tumor growth in a mouse model of medulloblastoma (MB) driven by constitutively active Smoothened (SMO). However, cilia depletion in a GLI2-driven model of MB accelerated tumor growth (Han et al., 2009) . Therefore, the role of cilia in cancer remains unclear and is likely to be context dependent. Furthermore, characterization of primary cilia in glioblastoma cells suggests that cancer-associated cilia may be structurally distinct (Moser et al., 2009; Sarkisian et al., 2014; Moser et al., 2014) .A number of cancer drugs inhibit proteins that have been shown to localize to cilia, such as EGFR and PDGFR (Christensen et al., 2012) . These drugs (e.g., the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib) promote significant tumor regressions in appropriate patient populations (e.g., EGFR mutant non-small cell lung carcinoma patients). However, these responses are invariably followed by the emergence of lethal drug-resistant disease. Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of drug resistance has facilitated the design and deployment of second-line therapies that can target drug-resistant tumors (Awada et al., 2015) . However, the characterization of these mechanisms (particularly those that do not involve mutation of the drug target itself) has been limited, and specific to the individual target or drug. Thus, drug resistance remains the main obstacle in delivering long-lasting therapeutic benefit. The identification of cell biological processes that facilitate and support the emergence of drug resistance may provide new therapeutic opportunities with broad applicability.In this study, we report that the number and length of primary cilia are upregulated both in de novo and acquired kinase inhibitor resistance (KIR). These changes are associated with distinct molecular and structural features at the cilium, including (1) failure to control cilia length, (2) increased Hedgehog pathway activation, and (3) cilia fragmentation. Cilia elongation via Kif7 knockdown is sufficient to increase survival in the presence of kinase inhibitors, thus suggesting that cilia elongation has a critical role in promoting drug resistance.

We performed a time series of RNA-seq experiments at five developmental stages during pollen development and three different time points after pollination in Brassica rapa and identified 12 051 putative lncRNAs. A comprehensive view of dynamic lncRNA expression networks underpinning pollen development and fertilization was provided. B. rapa lncRNAs share many common characteristics of lncRNAs: relatively short length, low expression but specific in narrow time windows, and low evolutionary conservation. Gene modules and key lncRNAs regulating reproductive development such as exine formation were uncovered. Forty-seven cis-acting lncRNAs and 451 trans-acting lncRNAs were revealed to be highly coexpressed with their target protein-coding genes. Of particular importance are the discoveries of 14 lncRNAs that were highly coexpressed with 10 function-known pollen-associated coding genes. Fifteen lncRNAs were predicted as endogenous target mimics for 13 miRNAs, and two lncRNAs were proved to be functional target mimics for miR160 after experimental verification and shown to function in pollen development. Our study provides the systematic identification of lncRNAs during pollen development and fertilization in B. rapa and forms the foundation for future genetic, genomic, and evolutionary studies.", "citation_paragraph": "Although an increasing number of lncRNAs have been identified in plants, such as in A. thaliana (Matsui et al., 2008; Ben Amor et al., 2009; Song et al., 2009; Swiezewski et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2012; Jin et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014) , Medicago truncatula (Wen et al., 2007) , rice , Zea mays (Boerner and McGinnis, 2012; Li et al., 2014) , wheat (Xin et al., 2011) , Populus trichocarpa (Shuai et al., 2014) , and cotton , the identification of the function of lncRNAs in the reproduction processes in plants is in the early stages, even in model plants . Here, a time series of RNA-seq experiments was performed from the beginning of floral bud formation to the early fertilization stages in plants, with systematically identified lncRNAs associated with sexual reproduction. The only difference between the sterile and fertile plants of the 'Bcajh97-01A/B' GMS line, the plant material we used in this study, is the pollen abortion resulting from male meiosis cytokinesis in sterile plants (Huang et al., 2008) . This makes the material a good system to study gene expression during pollen development. Differences in the expression of transcripts including protein-coding genes and miRNAs had been revealed between fertile and sterile floral buds in our previous studies, and many candidate genes had been characterized (Huang et al., 2008 (Huang et al., , 2009a Jiang et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2014 Lin et al., , 2018 . Here, the discovery of a set of differentially expressed lncRNAs between fertile and sterile plants provides an additional important intriguing clue to understand the regulation of male fertility in B. rapa. Moreover, as one of the most important vegetable crops worldwide, B. rapa is considered an ideal candidate to act as a reference species for Brassica genomic studies . The genome-wide characterization of lncRNAs in B. rapa will provide a unique annotation resource for the B. rapa genome.The lncRNAs identified in this study showed a developmentally regulated expression manner (stage or tissuespecific). According to studies in mammals, the temporal expression profile of lncRNAs revealed that lncRNAs are expressed in narrower time windows than protein-coding genes (Pauli et al., 2012) . A similar conclusion could be drawn from our results. Quite a few B. rapa lncRNAs were expressed in one tissue exclusively. It has been proposed that lncRNA expression signatures may be able to accurately determine the developmental lineage and tissue origin because of their more tissue-specific expression pattern (Derrien et al., 2012) . The further exploration of those lncRNAs that are specific to a given developmental stage discovered in our study may achieve a breakthrough leading to a better understanding of the molecular control of sexual reproduction in plants.LncRNAs could regulate gene expression either in cis or in trans (Fatica and Bozzoni, 2014) . Cis-acting lncRNAs were first reported to control the expression of genes that are positioned in the vicinity of their transcription sites (Orom et al., 2010; Marquardt et al., 2014) . Later, more and more trans-acting lncRNAs were discovered that could regulate gene expression at independent loci (Rinn et al., 2007; Tian et al., 2010; Ng et al., 2012; Hu et al., 2014; Yuan et al., 2014) . Additionally, studies showed that some of the cis-and trans-acting lncRNAs also overlapped , highlighting the complexity of the molecular roles of lncRNAs. Given that lncRNAs have tissue-specific expression patterns and are often coexpressed with their targetcoding genes, a method to infer putative biological function based on correlation in expression between lncRNAs and coding genes was also developed (Huarte et al., 2010) . In this study, we predicted the cis-and trans-target proteincoding genes of lncRNAs and performed a coexpression analysis between them. A group of cis-and trans-acting lncRNAs together with their target genes were found to be strongly coexpressed, including 10 target protein-coding genes orthologous to the function-known pollen or pollen tube-associated genes in A. thaliana. To date, with the exception of LDMAR, which was found to control photoperiod-sensitive male sterility in rice (Ding et al., 2012) , no lncRNA was characterized in male reproductive processes. Further investigation of these lncRNAs that are highly coexpressed with those function-known coding target genes may be the first step to elucidate the gene expression regulation pathway involving lncRNAs in the male reproductive process. Interestingly, we found a higher proportion of positive correlations among cis correlations than among trans correlations (46 of 47 highly related pairs for cis versus 1011 of 2025 highly related pairs for trans). A similar situation was found in the expression feature of human lncRNAs annotated by GENCODE (Derrien et al., 2012) and in a study regarding the transcriptional landscape that regulates human lymphoid commitment during postnatal life (Casero et al., 2015) . Studies in humans have questioned that some positive correlations may arise from lncRNAs being unannotated UTRs of neighboring protein- coding genes (Derrien et al., 2012) or may be due to shared upstream regulation between lncRNAs and their neighboring genes (Ma et al., 2012) . To confirm whether the higher positive correlations among cis correlations are mainly resulted from these presumptions, full-length cloning and further functional elucidation of these lncRNAs are needed. Many cis-acting lncRNAs have been demonstrated to activate the expression of flanking genes. For example, enhancer RNAs could activate corresponding genes in cis via their products (Orom et al., 2010) . These lncRNAs that are significantly coexpressed with nearby protein-coding genes thus represent interesting candidates to be tested in future experimental studies. Recently, lncRNAs were demonstrated to be involved in a newly identified miRNA regulation mechanism termed target mimicry (or natural miRNA sponge) that initially was studied in A. thaliana (Franco-Zorrilla et al., 2007; Ivashuta et al., 2011; Rubio-Somoza et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2013) . Several lncRNAs, such as ath-eTM160-1, ath-eTM166-1, osa-eTM160-3, and nta-eTMX27, showed effective inhibition ability on the corresponding miRNA activities in A. thaliana and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) . In this study, we predicted the eTMs of miRNAs that were previously identified in B. rapa floral buds, and 15 potential eTMs for 13 miRNAs were identified. The eTM-binding sites for the same miRNAs were found to be well conserved in B. rapa and A. thaliana. Therefore, we proposed that certain interactions between these potential eTMs and miRNAs may exist and play a fundamental role in pollen development. By overexpressing the eTMs in B. rapa, we demonstrated that braeTM160-1 and bra-eTM160-2 had inhibitory ability on bramiR160-5p and participated in pollen formation and male fertility through upregulating ARF genes, especially BrARF17. A previous study had shown that ARF17 is essential for primexine formation and pollen development in A. thaliana, as primexine was absent in the arf17 mutant, which leads to pollen wall-patterning defects and pollen degradation . Plants with increased ARF17 mRNA levels upon expressing a miR160-resistant version of ARF17 also showed male sterility (Mallory et al., 2005) , but the reason for the sterility was unknown. In this study, the reason that increased ARF17 mRNA levels induced sterility was discovered in B. rapa. It is interesting that a potential dosage-dependent regulation may render eTMs as an endogenous modulator for plant miRNA functions. Among the transgenic plants overexpressing braeTM160-1, only the plants with the higher level of braeTM160-1 expression showed phenotype. A similar result was found in a previous study, which aimed to identify the eTM osa-eTM160-3 for rice miR160. Only one-half of the transgenic plants that expressed osa-eTM160-3 at higher levels showed visible phenotypes , suggesting that the expression of eTMs has to reach a certain level to effectively saturate the corresponding miRNAs. However, for bra-eTM160-2, transgenic plants overexpressing bra-eTM160-2 at a moderate level could show visible phenotypes, indicating that the efficiency of the two eTMs for miR160 in B. rapa is different. Variations in efficiency of eTMs were also reported in other studies. For example, the efficiency of a rice eTM for miR160 was higher than that of an A. thaliana eTM when they functioned in A. thaliana . As these two eTMs are highly conserved in sequences complementary to miR160, but the majority of their sequences is very diverse outside of the target mimicry region, the author suggested that the backbone sequences of eTMs may contribute to their functional differences . Similarly, Bra-eTM160-1 and bra-eTM160-2 are conserved only in the regions that are complementary to miR160, while other regions are very different. Although further experiments are needed to verify this hypothesis, differences in efficiency of eTMs might be common in plants. In addition, one miRNA usually has more than one eTM. Some eTMs showed great variation in expression among tissues . The expression of bra-eTM160-1 and bra-eTM160-2 among tissues is different. The potential dosage-dependent regulation, variation in expression and functional efficiency among eTMs may help to fine-tune miRNAs in a more temporal-or cell type-specific manner.In addition to the functionality, the evolution of lncRNAs is still largely unexplored. A recent study in tetrapods indicated that most lncRNAs evolve rapidly in terms of sequences and expression levels, but tissue specificities Figure 9 . Anther transverse sections of transgenic Brassica rapa overexpressing bra-eTM160-1 or bra-eTM160-2. Sections of anthers at tetrad stage, uninucleate pollen stage, binucleate pollen stage, and trinucleate pollen stage in wild-type plants (WT) and transgenic plants overexpressing bra-eTM160-1 or bra-eTM160-2. Scale bars, 50 lm. are often conserved (Necsulea et al., 2014) . For plant lncRNAs, such analyses remain scarce. A recent blast search of strawberry lncRNAs against the lncRNAs identified in several non-Rosaceae plant species yielded none or very few homologs (Kang and Liu, 2015) , suggesting limited evolutionary conservation in plant lncRNAs. Here, we compared the sequence similarity of lncRNAs in B. rapa and its closely related species A. thaliana and found that only approximately 5% (624 out of 12 051) had homologs in A. thaliana. Interestingly, the expression of these conserved lncRNAs was tissue-specific. These results indicated that lncRNAs might have similar evolution mechanisms in terms of tissue specificities in both plants and animals. All in all, genome-wide screening and functional analysis enabled the identification of a set of lncRNAs and their functional links with neighbors, and may reveal a more general mechanism for the regulation of the sexual reproduction process in B. rapa.(a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) (h) (i) (j) (k) (l) (m) (n)", "citance": "Cis-acting lncRNAs were first reported to control the expression of genes that are positioned in the vicinity of their transcription sites (Orom et al., 2010; Marquardt et al., 2014) .", "claims": [{"text": "Cis-acting lncRNAs control the expression of genes that are positioned in the vicinity of their transcription sites.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 833416, "title": "New Aspects on the Structure of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and In Vitro Generation", "abstract": "Polymorphonuclear neutrophils have in recent years attracted new attention due to their ability to release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). These web-like extracellular structures deriving from nuclear chromatin have been depicted in ambiguous roles between antimicrobial defence and host tissue damage. NETs consist of DNA strands of varying thickness and are decorated with microbicidal and cytotoxic proteins. Their principal structure has in recent years been characterised at molecular and ultrastructural levels but many features that are of direct relevance to cytotoxicity are still incompletely understood. These include the extent of chromatin decondensation during NET formation and the relative amounts and spatial distribution of the microbicidal components within the NET. In the present work, we analyse the structure of NETs found in induced sputum of patients with acutely exacerbated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) using confocal laser microscopy and electron microscopy. In vitro induced NETs from human neutrophils serve for purposes of comparison and extended analysis of NET structure. Results demonstrate that COPD sputa are characterised by the pronounced presence of NETs and NETotic neutrophils. We provide new evidence that chromatin decondensation during NETosis is most extensive and generates substantial amounts of double-helix DNA in 'beads-on-a-string' conformation. New information is also presented on the abundance and location of neutrophil elastase (NE) and citrullinated histone H3 (citH3). NE occurs in high densities in nearly all non-fibrous constituents of the NETs while citH3 is much less abundant. We conclude from the results that (i) NETosis is an integral part of COPD pathology; this is relevant to all future research on the etiology and therapy of the disease; and that (ii) release of 'beads-on-a-string' DNA studded with non-citrullinated histones is a common feature of in vivo NETosis; this is of relevance to both the antimicrobial and the cytotoxic effects of NETs.", "citation_paragraph": "The results of the present study deliver direct new morphological evidence that NETs are a major component in the sputa of patients with exacerbated COPD. Equally importantly, the present results also provide new knowledge of the structure of NETs and their possible biological functions.The combined evidence from CLSM, SEM and TEM strongly supports the conclusion that relevant amounts of the PMNs known to invade the airways of COPD patients undergo NETosis, thereby generating functional NETs, specifically during the exacerbation episodes. Accordingly, the sputa of such patients were commonly characterised by the pronounced presence of both NETs ( Figs. 2A-F, 4A -E,H, 6A-C,F) and NETotic PMNs (Fig. 3) , in strong contrast to the absence or extremely limited presence of such structures in almost all of the control sputa (Fig. S1A) . COPD sputum NETs could be clearly identified by comparison with in vitro induced NETs (Figs. 4F,G, 5A-D, 6D ,E,G,H) and according to the typology provided by the key literature to date [1, 2] . The PMNs contained in these sputa (Fig. 3 ) represent all steps of the NETotic cascade as defined in the recent literature [2, 13, 15] . These include undisturbed normal sized globular cells with smooth membranes, well defined lobulated nuclei and a clear separation of NE positive cytoplasmic granules and nuclear chromatin, cells at various stages of progressing cytoplasmic and nuclear swelling, vacuolisation and pseudopodial membrane protrusion, chromatin decondensation and histone citrullination, and cells exhibiting membrane rupture and NET release (eg. Figs. 3, 4A) . Similarly, the morphology of the NETs contained in COPD sputa is in all relevant aspects, including those of bacterial entrapment (Fig. 4C ) and DNase sensitivity (Fig. 2G-I ), similar to that of in vitro generated NETs as shown in the literature (eg. [36] and by our own present experimentation. High congruence is also evident in comparison to NETs from other chronic inflammatory disorders in the airways and elsewhere. COPD NETs correspond in detail to those found in the sputa of patients with CF [5, 17] and in subgingival plaques from patients with periodontis [37] . This relates also to the features of immunolocalisation of NE, citH3 and PAD4 during the NETotic process and in the generated NETs themselves [2] . The unexpected finding that staining for PAD4 and citH3 at cytoplasmic sites of activated PMNs is just as common as at nuclear sites (Figs. 3C-F) conforms with the principal characteristics of PAD4 localisation in neutrophils and other cell of the innate immune system [38] , and with the observation by [39] that H3 deimination during NETosis occurs to a relevant extent in the cytoplasm. The resulting overall picture of COPD sputum NETs is in close agreement with the 'NET release during pseudopodial crawling' model of [15] . Examination of COPD NETs collected by bronchoscopy may, as a next step, serve to further determine their direct interaction with airway epithelia and role in loss of respiratory function.Regarding the general micromorphology of NETs, the present results expand upon the previous (ultra)structural analyses in a number of ways. Perhaps the most important finding in this direction is that TEM of negative stained specimens reveals -to our understanding for the first time in a clear way -that nuclear chromatin decondensation during NETosis is most extensive (Figs. 5, 6 ) and involves unstacking of nucleosomes down to dimensions much smaller than the 15-17 nm chromatin stretches described by [6, 1, 4] . The present results provide evidence that relevant proportions of the DNA fibres in COPD NETs are comprised of nucleosome-bearing single double-helix molecules in 'beads-on-a-string' conformation (Fig. 6G,H) , as known from previous experimental TEM analyses of chromosomal DNA [34, 35] and recent atomic force microscopy based models of chromatin structure [40] . 'Beads-on-a-string' DNA has as yet been only shown in the dilated perinuclear spaces and cytoplasmic vesicles of human neutrophils during a rapid form of NETosis in response to in vitro induction by Staphylococcus aureus [32] . The present results, however, suggest that 'beads-on-a-string' DNA is routinely released in relevant quantities during 'normal type' NETosis, both in vitro and in vivo, and is thus a common feature of NETs. The additional finding that the nucleosomes on such DNA strings remain all unlabelled after immunogold staining for citH3 (Fig. 6H) indicates that their histone octamers are unaffected by PAD4 mediated arginine deimination. This in turn would mean that the citrullination of histone proteins, a molecular feature regarded as essential for NET formation [9] , is in fact a nonquantitative process. This may provide a starting point for exciting new work into the structures and dynamics of NETosis.Another set of findings from the present work that consolidate and improve the present knowledge on NET structure and its functional implications relates to the abundance of bactericidal proteins and their location within the NETs. The serine protease NE is one of the most powerful molecular weapons that PMNs keep available to degrade engulfed bacteria in the phagolysosome [41] . NE has been shown to contribute to nuclear chromatin decondensation during NETosis [42] and is characteristically found in NETs (eg. [1] including those contained in CF sputum [17, 43] ). The present CLSM and immunogold TEM results confirm that NE is indeed also a bulk constituent of NETs derived from COPD sputum. It occurs in high densities in nearly all of the amorphous 'grid point' aggregates of these NETs (Fig. 6A ), but also at many other, probably non-DNA-associated positions in the sputum matrix (Fig. 2D-F) . This pattern is similar to that found for in vitro generated NETs (Fig. 6D) . However, ambiguity still remains surrounding the extent of the noxious effects of NET-bound NE, especially in the light of recent evidence that experimental NE inhibition does not inhibit the cytotoxicity of NETs [44] . This requires further research.A similarly ambiguous picture is seen for histones. Being highly cationic, histones have long been attached with an extracellular bactericidal role, specifically in NETs [1, 45] . In this direction, the present results show that citrullinated histone H3 (citH3) positive sites are much less frequent in NETs than NE positive sites (Figs. 6A,B,D,E) . This is, to our knowledge, the first experimental evidence of a rather limited occurrence of citH3 in NETs and suggests a similarly limited role in the functions and effects of NETs. This would reaffirm the previous finding that PAD4-mediated citrullination decreases the bactericidal activity of histones, thus confining its role to chromatin decondensation during NET formation instead of improving bacterial killing [8] . However, there is increasing evidence that citrullinated proteins externalised in NETs also act indirectly to reinforce and perpetuate the inflammatory cycle via induction of autoantibodies [46] [47] [48] , thus revaluing the contribution of citH3 to the cumulative effects of histones in NETs. These effects may be further strengthened by the finding that NETs are likely to contain a substantial quantity of non-citrullinated histones on 'beads-on-astring' DNA (Fig. 6G,H) . This indicates that the bactericidal capability of NETs, just as their histone-dependent cytotoxicity [44] , may be enhanced by a relevant amount of non-citrullinated histones. As these histones are freely exposed on fully dispersed DNA, they are best enabled to establish tight surface contact with both pathogens and epithelial cells (Fig. 6C) . This is in agreement with the experimental results of Saffarzadeh and coworkers. [44] showing that histones are main inductors of NET-mediated epithelial and endothelial cell death. This is also in agreement with, and strengthens, the previous finding that the bactericidal effects of NETs are largely eliminated by DNase treatment, and are therefore likely to require microbe entrapment by the extracellular chromatin and exposure to high local concentrations of bactericidal agents [13, 44] .", "citance": "However, there is increasing evidence that citrullinated proteins externalised in NETs also act indirectly to reinforce and perpetuate the inflammatory cycle via induction of autoantibodies [46] [47] [48] , thus revaluing the contribution of citH3 to the cumulative effects of histones in NETs.", "claims": [{"text": "Citrullinated proteins externalized in neutrophil extracellular traps act indirectly to disrupt the inflammatory cycle.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Citrullinated proteins externalized in neutrophil extracellular traps act indirectly to perpetuate the inflammatory cycle via induction of autoantibodies.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Externalized citrullinated proteins in NETs induce autoantibodies that indirectly prolong inflammation.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

In this study, we have newly generated a monoclonal antibody (mAb), Pa65-2, which specifically binds to pancreatic cancer cells and tumor blood vessels. The target protein of Pa65-2 is identified as human clathrin heavy chain (CHC). In vitro and In vivo study showed that suppression of CHC either by shRNA or by Pa65-2 inhibited tumor growth and angiogenesis. One of the key functions of CHC was to bind with the hypoxia-inducing factor (HIF)-1\u03b1 protein, increasing the stability of this protein and facilitating its nuclear translocation, thereby regulating the expression of VEGF. Taken together, our findings indicate that CHC plays a role in the processes of tumorigenesis and angiogenesis. Pa65-2 antibody or CHC shRNA can potentially be used for pancreatic cancer therapy.", "citation_paragraph": "About 95% of pancreatic cancer cases are adenocarcinomas. The overall five-year survival rate of pancreatic adenocarcinoma is about 5%. It is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States [1] . Pancreatic cancer often recurs after initial treatment despite the use of chemotherapy or radiation therapy [2] . At present, there is no effective treatment for pancreatic cancer. The most commonly used medicine to treat pancreatic cancer is gemcitabine (GEM), a pyrimidine nucleoside drug, but it is only moderately effective [3] .Two monoclonal antibody (mAbs) drugs currently in clinical trial for targeted therapy against pancreatic cancers are cetuximab [4] and bevacizumab [5, 6] , targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), respectively. However, clinical trial data showed that using either cetuximab or bevacizumab, in combination with small molecule drugs had no significant improvement in the overall survival of pancreatic cancer patients [4] [5] [6] [7] . Since EGFR and VEGF may not be suitable target for pancreatic cancer treatment, it is important to identify a suitable target for targeting therapy of pancreatic cancer.We have generated several mAbs recognizing pancreatic cancer cells. One of these mAbs, Pa65-2, can recognize clathrin heavy chain (CHC). Clathrin, encoded by the CLTC gene at 17q23.2, is a trimer of heavy chains ($190 kDa each), each paired with a light chain (25) (26) (27) . The basic unit of its assembly is the triskelion, which has a flexible, three-armed polyhedral cage-like structure [8] . Clathrin plays a crucial role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) pathway, a major route for membrane trafficking. It is involved in the ubiquitous uptake of ligand-receptor complexes, membrane transporters, and adhesion molecules [9] . Clathrin also stabilizes the fibers of the spindle apparatus during mitosis [10] . However, the main mechanism of CHC in tumorigenesis remains unknown.In this study, we found that CHC may regulate the stability of the a subunit of hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1a). When cells are exposed to hypoxic conditions, HIF-1a is stabilized, which subsequently upregulates several downstream genes to promote cell survival in low-oxygen conditions. HIF-1a accumulation mediates cellular and systemic adaptive responses to maintain oxygen homeostasis. It also upregulates hypoxia-inducible genes, which are involved in angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, energy metabolism as well as cell survival decisions in all metazoan species [11] . In cancerous conditions, cells within rapidly growing solid tumors are exposed to chronic or intermittent hypoxia. Therefore, tumor cells encounter powerful selective pressure from hypoxia during their progression, invasion, and metastasis [12] . An elevated expression of hypoxia-responsive proteins is a poor prognostic sign in many types of solid tumors [13] [14] [15] , and the results from several studies suggest that agents acting directly or indirectly against the expression of HIF-1a have anticancer effects [16, 17] .In the present study, we found that CHC associates with the HIF-1a, increases the stability of this protein, and facilitates its nuclear translocation, thereby regulating VEGF gene expression in cancer cells.

{"s2orc_id": 16515311, "title": "Congenital Malformations among Babies Born Following Letrozole or Clomiphene for Infertility Treatment", "abstract": "CONTEXT Clomiphene citrate (CC) is the first line drug for ovulation induction but because of its peripheral antiestrogenic effect, letrozole was introduced as the 2nd line drug. It lacks the peripheral antiestrogenic effect and is associated with similar or even higher pregnancy rates. Since letrozole is a drug for breast cancer, its use for the purpose of ovulation induction became controversial in the light of studies indicating an increased incidence of congenital malformations.   AIMS To evaluate and compare the incidence of congenital malformations among offsprings of infertile couples who conceived naturally or with clomiphene citrate or letrozole treatment.   SETTINGS AND DESIGN A retrospective cohort study done at a tertiary infertility centre.   METHODS AND MATERIAL A total of 623 children born to infertile women who conceived naturally or following clomiphene citrate or letrozole treatment were included in this study. Subjects were sorted out from medical files of both mother and newborn and follow up study was done based on the information provided by parents through telephonic conversations. Babies with suspected anomaly were called and examined by specialists for the presence of major and minor congenital malformations. Other outcomes like multiple pregnancy rate and birth weight were also studied.   RESULTS Overall, congenital malformations, chromosomal abnormalities were found in 5 out of 171 (2.9%) babies in natural conception group and 5 out of 201 babies in the letrozole group (2.5%) and in 10 of 251 babies in the CC group (3.9%).   CONCLUSIONS There was no significant difference in the overall rate of congenital malformations among children born to mothers who conceived naturally or after letrozole or CC treatment.   KEY MESSAGES Congenital malformations have been found to be comparable following natural conception, letrozole and clomiphene citrate. Thus, the undue fear against letrozole may be uncalled for.", "citation_paragraph": "Letrozole has been used for ovarian stimulation since the late 1990s. Studies have shown that it is an effective oral agent for this purpose. It has no significant active metabolites and has a half-life of approximately 45 hours (range 30-60 hours) and should be cleared from the body completely by the time of embryo implantation when used in early follicular phase, for the purpose of ovulation induction.The study presented by Biljan et al (2005) at ASRM meeting in which they compared 130 letrozole pregnancies with over 36,000 low risk spontaneous pregnancies, reported that letrozole might increase the risk of cardiac and bone anomalies in the newborns [6] however, the overall rate of major malformations did not differ between the two groups. This study, which brought letrozole into disrepute, had many flaws. First and foremost being the heterogeneity between the two groups. Study group included infertile population who by virtue of their infertility are at high risk for having babies with congenital malformations both after spontaneous conception or following infertility treatment [11] . This high-risk population was compared with a low-risk fertile population who had spontaneous conception. Secondly, age of the control population at a standard hospital would likely include a high percentage of younger women (mean age: 30.5 years) who, by nature have a lesser chance of having a malformed baby than a study population of older age (mean age: 35.2 yrs in letrozole group). Thirdly, the reported malformation rate of 1.8% in the ''control'' population in this study appears to be low as the rate of birth defects in the general population is 3% for major malformations and 6% when minor malformations were included [12] . It is probably because babies with major abnormalities diagnosed on prenatal ultrasound were delivered at a tertiary care hospital rather than a community hospital leading to under- reporting of defects in the ''control'' population. Moreover, multifetal pregnancy rate was higher in the study group, and it is well known that congenital malformations are more common in multiple births than in singletons. Lastly, there was a huge disparity between the sizes of the two study groups (130 vs 36,000). Thus, comparing two unmatched populations makes the study design as well as its results questionable. Our work focused on comparing the rate of congenital malformation between three groups of infertile women conceiving either naturally or with CC or letrozole. Women of like demographic profile were studied thereby representing a true controlled study. In our study, data of only 4 letrozole babies could be retrieved for the year 2007 (Table 1) , because it was being prescribed sparingly at that time and its usage increased in the subsequent years after approval from the drug controller of India. In our study overall rate of congenital malformation is nonsignificantly higher in natural conception group and CC group compared to letrozole group. The incidence of congenital heart disease among children born following natural conception is comparable to that with letrozole group. Three babies of CC group with congenital heart disease were excluded as they were born to diabetic mothers.Our results are comparable with that of Tulandi et al, a large retrospective multicentre study done on 911 babies born after ovulation induction with either letrozole (n = 514) or CC (n = 397). In their study, the congenital malformations and chromosomal abnormalities were comparable between the two groups (2.4% in the letrozole group; 4.8% in the CC group) but the rate of all congenital cardiac anomalies were significantly higher (P = 0.02) in the CC group (1.8%) compared to the letrozole group (0.2%) [13] . A recent study looking at birth defects with assisted reproduction also found an increased risk for birth defects in babies born to mothers using CC. After adjusting for confounding factors the odds ratio for CC use and any birth defect was 3.19 (1.32-7.69) [14] .Forman et al, observed lower malformation rate in letrozole group (0%) compared with CC group (2.6%) or spontaneous conception (3.2%) [15] . In a randomized study by Badawy et al comparing 129 deliveries each in CC, letrozole and spontaneous pregnancy groups, authors reported the similar malformation rate in each group [16] . They reported one case of complete cleft palate and one case of major congenital heart problem in the letrozole group and 2 cases of talipus equinovarus in CC and spontaneous pregnancy group. In our study, three cases of hypospadias were found in CC group, out of which 2 had severe (penoscrotal) variety. Our finding is similar to the study done by Meijer et al., who reported high association (OR = 6.08) of severe hypospadias with clomiphene usage [17] . In contrast, Sorenson et.al in their study didn't find any increased risk of hypospadias with clomiphene [18] .Besides congenital malformations, we also studied mean birth weight and multiple pregnancy rates in all three groups. Mean birth weight was found to be significantly lower in CC group. Our results are similar to study by Forman et al who also reported lower birth weight in CC group compared to the letrozole group, after excluding twin pregnancies [15] . However, other workers have not reported any difference in the birth weight among letrozole, CC and spontaneous pregnancies [16] . It is well established that letrozole diminishes the incidence of multiple gestations because of monofollicular development. We also observed a higher prevalence of twins in CC group than in the letrozole group though the difference was not statistically significant.Research in animals has shown that letrozole may be teratogenic when used during pregnancy but it does not have any adverse effects when used as an ovulation induction (OI) drug. A study done by Luthra et al (2003) showed that when aromataseoverexpressing mice were treated with high doses of letrozole for 6 weeks and allowed to conceive 2 weeks later, there was no difference between treated and control animals in terms of litter size, birth weight, and anomalies [19] . In another study done at our institute, superovulation in mice with letrozole was shown not to increase the risk to spindle assembly and blastocyst formation in oocytes as evidenced by the birefringent characteristics of the meiotic spindle and preimplantational development of the embryos using Polscope imaging. Study concluded that the risk of aneuploidies or chromosomal defects appears to be low with letrozole [20] . However, regarding its use during pregnancy, animal data has suggested that gestational exposure of letrozole was associated with embryo and fetal toxicity at a concentration much lower than 1% of the human dose [21, 22] . Tiboni et al (2008) observed that exposing rats to letrozole at a dose lower than the recommended human therapeutic dose during pregnancy resulted in a marked increase in intrauterine lethality. The authors concluded that letrozole should not necessarily be regarded as a safe agent for OI although it may not adversely affect morphogenesis when administered before fertilization [23] .A population-based multicenter case control study of major birth defects found an increase in cardiac malformations in the pregnancies following CC [24] . In a review article by Casper et al letrozole seems to be atleast as effective as CC for induction of ovulation and live birth, with some potential advantages over CC [25] . Ongoing, large randomized multicenter studies by clinics in the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Reproductive Medicine Network are underway that could potentially provide definitive evidence of the efficacy and safety of Letrozole compared with CC for infertility treatment [26] .Regarding the limitation of our study, 47 children were born outside our institute so we had to rely on the information provided by their parents to rule out the presence of anomaly. Moreover, our study is a retrospective study with a relatively small study group; we suggest a large multicentre prospective trial before letrozole is phased out, which can be a valuable addition to the armamentarium of ovulation inducing agents.

Approximately 80% of patients have a cytogenetic aberration. Interphase FISH panels have been the gold standard for cytogenetic evaluation, but conventional cytogenetics allows detection of additional abnormalities, including translocations, complex karyotypes and multiple clones. Whole genome copy number assessment, currently performed by chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA), is particularly relevant in CLL for the following reasons: (1) copy number alterations (CNAs) represent key events with biologic and prognostic significance; (2) DNA from fresh samples is generally available; and (3) the tumor burden tends to be relatively high in peripheral blood. CMA also identifies novel copy number variants and copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity (CN-LOH), and can refine deletion breakpoints. The Cancer Genomics Consortium (CGC) Working Group for CLL has performed an extensive literature review to describe the evidence-based clinical utility of CMA in CLL. We provide suggestions for the integration of CMA into clinical use and list recurrent copy number alterations, regions of CN-LOH and mutated genes to aid in interpretation.", "citation_paragraph": "Clonal diversity, a surrogate marker for clonal evolution, is defined as the presence of two or more clonal populations of cells at different levels of tumor involvement as detected by CMA.

{"s2orc_id": 4708263, "title": "Implementing the Bounce Back Trauma Intervention in Urban Elementary Schools: A Real-World Replication Trial", "abstract": "The current study provides the first replication trial of Bounce Back, a school-based intervention for elementary students exposed to trauma, in a different school district and geographical area. Participants in this study were 52 1st through 4th graders (Mage = 7.76 years; 65% male) who were predominately Latino (82%). Schools were randomly assigned to immediate treatment or waitlist control. Differential treatment effects (Time \u00d7 Group Interaction) were found for child-reported posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and parent-reported child coping, indicating that the immediate treatment group showed greater reductions in PTSD and improvements in coping compared with the delayed group. Differential treatment effects were not significant for depression or anxiety. Significant maintenance effects were found for both child-reported PTSD and depression as well as parent-reported PTSD and coping for the immediate treatment group at follow-up. Significant treatment effects were also found in the delayed treatment group, showing reductions in child-reported PTSD, depression, and anxiety as well as parent-reported depression and coping upon receiving treatment. In conclusion, the current study suggests that Bounce Back is an effective intervention for reducing PTSD symptoms and improving coping skills, even among a sample experiencing high levels of trauma and other ongoing stressors.", "citation_paragraph": "and 5.8% had witnessed family violence (Finkelhor, Turner, Shattuck, & Hamby, 2015) . Although many children show resilience after traumatic exposure, one large longitudinal study found that rates of psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, and disruptive behavior were almost double among youth exposed to trauma compared with nontraumatized youth (Copeland, Keeler, Angold, & Costello, 2007) . Furthermore, children with exposure to multiple types of trauma are at increased risk for developing symptoms of posttraumatic stress (Copeland et al., 2007) .Not surprisingly, trauma exposure exerts a negative impact on academic outcomes (Porche, Fortuna, Lin, & Alegria, 2011) . Trauma exposure, particularly when it is chronic or occurs early in development, has a direct negative impact on neurobiology, attention, and cognitive processes (Shonkoff, 2010) . In addition, psychological symptoms disrupt children's ability to effectively regulate their emotions and behaviors and focus in the classroom (Porche et al., 2011) . Given widespread trauma exposure and its impact on school performance, educational settings have increasingly recognized the need for trauma-informed strategies to increase identification of students who may be showing early signs of distress and prevent subsequent academic impact (Cole, Eisner, Gregory, & Ristuccia, 2013) . The provision of mental health services in schools increases the likelihood that students will receive needed treatment because it reduces common barriers to accessing treatment, such as transportation, cost, and stigma (Overstreet & Mathews, 2011) . This is particularly important for low-income, minority youth, who are both more likely to experience trauma and less likely to receive mental health treatment (Crouch, Hanson, Saunders, Kilpatrick, & Resnick, 2000) .A school-based intervention with a strong evidence base is the Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Trauma in Schools (CBITS). CBITS has been shown to reduce symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression in one randomized controlled trial (RCT; Stein et al., 2003) and a quasi-experimental design conducted with Latino immigrant students . Although CBITS is a promising school-based intervention for 5th-through 12th-grade students, there are limited evidencebased trauma interventions for elementary students designed for and tested in the school setting. Trauma-focused cognitivebehavioral therapy (TF-CBT) has a strong evidence base for use with younger children, but it has not been formally evaluated in schools (Cohen, Mannarino, & Deblinger, 2006) . Thus, Bounce Back was created as a developmentally modified adaptation of CBITS that integrated some components of TF-CBT (Langley, Gonzalez, Sugar, Solis, & Jaycox, 2015) . Bounce Back is structured similarly to CBITS, although activities and content are tailored for 5-to 11-year-old children and parent involvement is a core component because parents may play a more central role in helping younger students practice and generalize new coping skills. In a previous RCT, students who received Bounce Back showed significant reductions in posttraumatic stress and anxiety symptoms compared with waitlist students (Langley et al., 2015) .Despite the initial support provided by Langley et al. (2015) , more research is needed to establish Bounce Back as an evidencebased treatment and support continued dissemination. To classify a treatment as well established, efficacy must be demonstrated as significantly superior to a waitlist control or placebo treatment in at least two research settings by two independent research teams (Southam-Gerow & Prinstein, 2014) . In addition to increasing the evidence base for Bounce Back, there is continued need to demonstrate that interventions are effective in multiple real-world settings serving diverse populations (Weisz, Sandler, Durlak, & Anton, 2005) . There remains a substantial gap in evidenced-based treatments and their implementation and sustainability in realworld community settings, often due to difficulty matching the characteristics and resources of community care (Atkins, Rusch, Mehta, & Lakind, 2016) . The first RCT was designed to close this gap by developing Bounce Back in partnership with the community and conducting a mixed efficacy-effectiveness trial with a school setting while still providing some supports from research staff (e.g., staff support for screening, materials; Langley et al., 2015) . Building on this foundation, subsequent trials delivered in community settings with \"usual care\" providers and resources are needed to ensure that Bounce Back is effective in the settings where it will be disseminated.", "citance": "CBITS has been shown to reduce symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression in one randomized controlled trial (RCT; Stein et al., 2003) and a quasi-experimental design conducted with Latino immigrant students .", "claims": [{"text": "Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Trauma in Schools (CBTIS) is not effective at surpressing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in Latino immigrant students.", "subject": "Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Trauma in Schools (CBTIS) ", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Trauma in Schools (CBTIS) suppresses depression in Latino immigrant students.", "subject": "Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Trauma in Schools (CBTIS) ", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Trauma in Schools (CBTIS) suppresses posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in Latino immigrant students.", "subject": "Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Trauma in Schools (CBTIS) ", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 21669291, "title": "NREM parasomnias: a treatment approach based upon a retrospective case series of 512 patients", "abstract": "BACKGROUND Non-REM parasomnias are not uncommon conditions in the general population. Current treatment options are based on small case series and reports. In this study, we aimed to present the clinical experience from a large cohort of patients.   PATIENTS Five hundred and twelve patients with Non-REM parasomnia or parasomnia overlap disorder (POD), who had undergone a video polysomnography and were exposed to treatment, were retrospectively identified. Treatment outcome was assessed based on patients' reports, and treatment approach on a locally accepted hierarchy of interventions.   RESULTS Forty percent of patients were diagnosed with sleepwalking, 23.8% with mixed-phenotype and 10% with POD. Ultimately, 97.2% reported adequate control of their symptoms. Moreover, 60.1% were treated with pharmacotherapy and 32.0% without, consistent across all phenotypes (p = 0.09). Benzodiazepines were the most common drugs prescribed (47.1%, p < 0.05). In the end, 37.7% of our patients were receiving a benzodiazepine as part of their successful treatment, 11.7% an antidepressant, 9.2% a z-drug, and 10.7% melatonin. Finally, 13.2%, 12.1%, and 5.8% of our patients reported good control of their symptoms with sleep hygiene, management of sleep-disordered breathing, and psychological interventions (cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT] or mindfulness-based stress reduction [MBSR]), as monotherapy, respectively.   CONCLUSION The treatment approach to effective treatment of the patients with Non-REM parasomnias or POD offering first sleep hygiene advice, next treatment of concurrent sleep disorders and management of other priming factors like stress and anxiety, and lastly pharmacotherapy for Non-REM parasomnia is supported by our results. Non pharmacological interventions were effective in one third of our patients, and CBT/MBSR and melatonin appeared promising new treatments.", "citation_paragraph": "Non rapid eye movement (NREM) parasomnias are abnormal behaviors arising primarily but not exclusively during non-REM stage three (N3) sleep. Phenotypes include sleepwalking, sleep terrors, confusional arousals, sexsomnia, and sleep-related eating disorder (SRED). Patients may also present with concurrent REM parasomnia, in a subtype of REM behaviour disorder (RBD) termed parasomnia overlap disorder (POD) [1e3] .Whilst the exact mechanism underlying NREM parasomnias is unknown, a number of predisposing, priming, and precipitating factors have been identified [4] . The mainstays of management of the NREM parasomnias are modulation of these factors and ensuring safety. Predisposing factors are thought to be primarily genetic, with many patients reporting a family history, and more recently genetic covariation between different phenotypes has been confirmed [5e8] . Thus, these factors are problematic to address. Priming factors typically increase the proportion and depth of N3 sleep or make arousal from it more difficult. It is postulated that these priming factors create a favourable environment for internal or external stimuli (precipitating factors) to trigger a partial arousal of the brain, manifesting as complex behaviors accounting for NREM parasomnia phenotypes. Potent priming factors are thought to include sleep deprivation, medications such as hypnotic drugs, and stress [4] . Precipitating factors include noise, touch from a bed partner, sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS) [4, 9] .Standard management strategies include a safety plan, reassurance and general measures to improve sleep hygiene. Patients should be advised on avoidance of sleep deprivation, caffeine and alcohol consumption (especially close to bed-time), moreover, medications should be reviewed for known interactions [4, 10, 11] .Treating co-morbid sleep disorders offers an alternative strategy to improving NREM parasomnias. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), even of mild severity, or upper airway resistance syndrome, can precipitate these nocturnal phenomena, and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment, mandibular advancement devices or upper airway tissue reduction surgeries have proven to be effective especially in patients with sleep walking [12] . Restless legs syndrome (RLS) and PLMS have been particularly associated with SRED, and dopaminergic agents and alpha-2-delta ligands are considered first-line treatments [13, 14] . Insomnia can also be effectively treated with cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia(CBTi) [15, 16] .Situational stress frequently triggers NREM parasomnias, and cognitive behavioral therapy for stress and anxiety (CBTs-a) can effectively alleviate this factor [17] . Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) has been in the spotlight over the past few years, and there is evidence that it can improve sleep, especially when it is practiced regularly [18, 19] . Traditionally, hypnotherapy has been used to treat patients with NREM parasomnias, especially with sleep walking [20] . Anticipatory awakening before the time that NREM parasomnia events are expected to occur has also been utilised therapeutically [21] .In severe cases however, or those refractory to initial management, pharmacotherapy is valuable. Although presently the evidence basis for these approaches consists primarily of a limited number of case reports and case series, with small numbers of patients and often contradictory results [14, 22] . Commonly prescribed medications include benzodiazepines or benzodiazepine receptor agonists, and antidepressants. A major issue is that these classes of medications can exacerbate NREM parasomnias, worsen precipitating factors for parasomnias (such as SDB and PLMS), and can increase daytime somnolence [4,23e25] . Clonazepam is commonly the first-line pharmacotherapy both for NREM parasomnias and RBD [14,22,26e28] . Antidepressants, including the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclics (TCAs) and the related drug trazodone may be of use in treating NREM parasomnias [4, 24] . Additionally, melatonin can effectively re-align a delayed circadian rhythm, treat insomnia and RBD, and potentially improve sleep terrors and sleep walking based on a handful of case reports in children [16,28e30] .The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of various treatments prescribed to a large unselected cohort of patients with a diagnosis of NREM parasomnia with or without coexisting RBD. In the absence of large prospective studies, we intended to expand the evidence base of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions in these conditions.", "citance": "Insomnia can also be effectively treated with cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia(CBTi) [15, 16] .Situational stress frequently triggers NREM parasomnias, and cognitive behavioral therapy for stress and anxiety (CBTs-a) can effectively alleviate this factor [17] .", "claims": [{"text": "Cognitive behavioral therapy is an ineffective treatment for insomnia", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Insomnia can be effectively treated with cognitive behavioral therapy.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 24844259, "title": "Silica dioxide nanoparticles combined with cold exposure induce stronger systemic inflammatory response", "abstract": "Growing concern has been raised over the potential hazard of nanoparticles (NPs) on human health from ambient particulate air pollution. Silicon dioxide (SiO2) NPs are one of the most widely used nanoparticles in many sectors of industry. Research on NPs has focused mainly on their toxicity in organs. Meanwhile, NPs are present in the air year-round, but are more serious in winter. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the inflammatory response to SiO2 NPs using in vivo test systems. The composition of particulate matter is complicated; however, elemental silicon accounts for a significant proportion. Cold exposure can induce many kinds of systemic reactions. Thus, the second aim of this study was also to evaluate the combined effect of NPs and cold exposure on human health. There is little research on the combined effects of nanoparticles and cold on inflammation. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: those exposed to SiO2 NPs by intratracheal instillation, those exposed to at 4 \u00b0C 4 h/day for 4 weeks, a combined SiO2 NPs and cold exposure group, and a control group. Inflammatory cell infiltration in the lungs was mainly observed after exposure to SiO2 NPs or cold. Hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed that inflammation of the lungs was more serious in the combined group. In the white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue of the combined groups, the mRNA expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines were upregulated. In conclusion, SiO2 NPs combined with cold exposure induced a stronger systemic inflammatory response, accompanied by more serious health hazards.", "citation_paragraph": "The present study demonstrated that the SiO 2 NPs could induce an inflammatory response when delivered by intratracheal instillation. After intratracheal instillation exposure, NPs accumulate in the lung, leading to phagocytosis and, depending on the atmospheric concentration, particle overload (Fabian et al. 2008) . Target organ toxicity, especially pulmonary toxicity, following exposure via inhalation has been the focus of several studies in the last decade. However, NPs can reach different organs of the body, such as the liver, spleen, kidney, and brain, through the blood circulation after inhalation exposure (Donaldson et al. 2005; Oberdorster et al. 2002) . Upon inhalation, they have been associated with a variety of adverse biological and physiological responses, including inflammation, fibrosis, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity (Hubbs et al. 2011) . Their systemic effects might also be the result of direct interaction of translocated NPs with the surrounding biological milieu (Jackson et al. 2013) . Indeed, the inflammatory response was the overwhelming biological effect observed in our transcript profiles, supporting previously observed phenotypic changes (Bourdon et al. 2012) . Thus, the SiO 2 NPs could induce a systemic inflammatory response. However, additional experiments that effectively bypass the pulmonary system, or those involving transgenic mice that are deficient in their ability to induce acute phase and/or immune response, are required to conclusively rule out the potential involvement of lung neuronal signaling, which is known to induce a systemic immune response (Husain et al. 2013) . Direct particle translocation is proposed to play a role in inducing these systemic effects; however, none of the above studies have confirmed the presence of particles in the tissues where an effect was observed (Husain et al. 2015) . The recent demonstration of the presence of brown fat in adult humans and the link between the thermogenic activity of this tissue and body weight control considerably increased research interest in the development and function of this tissue (Enerback 2010, Nedergaard and Cannon 2010) . Thus, we focused on the inflammatory response in adipose tissue. Error bars represent SEM. Significant differences compared with controls is indicated by *P < 0.05. Significant differences compared with the nano-SiO 2 group is indicated by \u25b2 P < 0.05. Significant differences compared with the cold exposure group is indicated by# P < 0.05We evaluated the role of exposure to SiO 2 nanoparticles and cold on the inflammatory response, as well as changes in inflammatory gene profiles in both the WAT and BAT in rat. Meanwhile, we combine SiO 2 NPs with cold exposure to assess the effects on eWAT and iBAT in the systemic inflammatory response. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the changes in inflammatory gene expression in adipose tissue treated with a combination of inhaled NPs and cold exposure. Studies suggested that NPs readily infiltrate deeper pulmonary regions, are capable of interacting with subcellular structures such as DNA, and are able to move readily across cellular and tissue barriers (Bourdon et al. 2012) . Thus, we accomplished the research aims by testing relative mRNA expressions. In adipose tissue, only a handful of cytokines have been studied, notably TNF-\u03b1 and various interleukins, including IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1\u03b2. The expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes IL-6, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 were significantly increased (P < 0.05) in the SiO 2 NPs and combined groups compared with the control in the WAT. Similarly, in the BAT, we found that the mRNA levels of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 were upregulated by SiO 2 NPs exposure, especially when SiO 2 NPs and cold exposure were combined. Our results clearly demonstrated that intratracheal instillation of SiO 2 NPs combined with cold exposure could induce a significant inflammatory response. The results further implied that translocation of particles might have played a direct role in the observed systemic effects in both the BAT and WAT. TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 inhibit lipoprotein lipase, and TNF-\u03b1 additionally stimulates hormone-sensitive lipase and induces uncoupling protein expression (Coppack 2001 ). IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 also reduce adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase activity (Hardardottir et al. 1994 ). IL-6 has also been linked to adipose tissue inflammation (Eder et al. 2009 ). IL-10, in contrast, attenuates inflammation and is decreased in obesity and the metabolic syndrome (Esposito et al. 2003) . IL-10 expression was downregulated in the BAT; perhaps IL-10 was mainly secreted by the WAT. However, cold exposure can induce a WAT browning effect (Diaz et al. 2014) . For purposes of discussion, cytokines may be considered as having \"metabolic\" effects, \"trophic\" effects, and effects on other regulatory systems within the adipose tissue, although such divisions are somewhat artificial and arbitrary, and do not reflect physiology. Our results were consistent with previous studies, which showed that intermittent cold exposure increases BAT recruitment (Dong et al. 2013 ). However, NPs affect energy metabolism via brown/white fat remodeling (Lin et al. 2016) . Thus, the effects of cold exposure are inhibited by silica dioxide nanoparticle. Therefore, our study demonstrated that nanoSiO 2 could upregulate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes, thus influence their secretion and metabolism. In the combined treatment, the SiO 2 NPs had a dominant effect on the SD rats. However, the combined factors demonstrated synergy to produce a stronger systemic inflammatory response. Therefore, we have reason to believe that inhaling ultrafine particles in the winter is the greater health hazard.In conclusion, the results of our study clearly demonstrated that SiO 2 NPs induce an inflammatory response when inhaled through the lungs. Together, SiO 2 NPs and cold influenced lung plasticity and metabolism in white/ brown adipose tissue by upregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, we speculated that humans would show similar responses. We believe that these findings will contribute to further understanding the potential health risks of a combination of haze and winter conditions.", "citance": "Our results were consistent with previous studies, which showed that intermittent cold exposure increases BAT recruitment (Dong et al. 2013 ).", "claims": [{"text": "Cold exposure increases BAT recruitment.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Cold exposure reduces BAT recruitment.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}
{"s2orc_id": 32092629, "title": "Concussion in Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy", "abstract": "Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that occurs in association with repetitive mild traumatic brain injury. It is associated with a variety of clinical symptoms in multiple domains, and there is a distinct pattern of pathological changes. The abnormal tau pathology in CTE occurs uniquely in those regions of the brain that are likely most susceptible to stress concentration during trauma. CTE has been associated with a variety of types of repetitive head trauma, most frequently contact sports. In cases published to date, the mean length of exposure to repetitive head trauma was 15.4 years. The clinical symptoms of the disease began after a mean latency of 14.5 years with a mean age of death of 59.3 years. Most subjects had a reported history of concussions with a mean of 20.3. However, 16 % of published CTE subjects did not have a history of concussion suggesting that subconcussive hits are sufficient to lead to the development of CTE. Overall, the number of years of exposure, not the number of concussions, was significantly associated with worse tau pathology in CTE. This suggests that it is the chronic and repetitive nature of head trauma, irrespective of concussive symptoms, that is the most important driver of disease. CTE and exposure to repetitive head trauma is also associated with a variety of other neurodegenerations, including Alzheimer disease. In fact, amyloid \u03b2 peptide deposition is altered and accelerated in CTE and is associated with worse disease. Here, we review the current exposure, clinical, and pathological associations of CTE.", "citation_paragraph": "In cases that come to autopsy within 6 months of a concussion, there is multifocal axonal injury that can occur in the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brainstem that is often associated with neuroinflammation, including increased microglia and reactive astrocytes [20] [21] [22] . Similar pathology is found in military veterans exposed to blast injury [16, 23] . This axonal injury and inflammatory response is markedly perivascular (reviewed in [22] ). In addition, in a subset of subjects exposed to blast injury (four of six) examined at the BU CTE Program, there was perivascular accumulation of phosphorylated tau [22] . This perivascular distribution of pathologies and accumulation of abnormal tau after blast exposure is strikingly reminiscent of the pathology seen in CTE years after impact injury. Whether the presence of perivascular tau after blast is related directly to blast exposure, a consequence of previous injury, or a consequence of impact injury secondary to the blast is not known [12\u2022\u2022] .The association of concussions with CTE has not been rigorously studied. While it is clear that a single concussion is not sufficient to lead to CTE, the precise threshold, if present, is unknown and likely varies depending on the severity of the injury and between individuals. In the published cases with concussion data, the majority of subjects with CTE have a reported history of concussion (84 %, n=92). The mean number of concussions was 17.0 (SEM=3.4, range=0-200; n=92; Table 1 ) overall and was 20.3 (SEM=3.9, range=1-200; n= 77) in those CTE subjects whose family members endorsed concussion [24\u2022\u2022] . The large number of concussions found in the majority of individuals with CTE suggests that multiple concussions are associated with this disease. However, there is great variability in the reported number of concussions, and subjective estimates may not correlate with the degree of RTBI exposure. Indeed, concussion is not always well defined and not always recognized. When given the current definition of concussion [25] , athletes will significantly increase the number of self-reported concussions [26] . Moreover, given the nature of a brain bank there is a retrospective bias as well as a reliance on recall information from family members, which may lead to erroneous numbers. Large prospective studies with clearly defined parameters for diagnosing concussion and follow-up pathological diagnoses or a yet to be developed in vivo diagnostic test will be necessary to firmly establish the association between concussions and CTE.Many head impacts do not result in a recognized concussion and may not be associated with any symptoms. Such injuries are considered Bsubconcussive^injuries and can be substantial in some sports. For instance, it has been reported that an offensive lineman in American football can experience over 1000 subconcussive hits over the level of 10g in the course of a single collegiate season [27] . NCAA Division I collegiate offensive linemen develop more postimpact symptoms than other playing positions but do not report these symptoms as a concussion, suggesting that offensive linemen experience more subconcussive injury compared to other positions [28] . A recent study of collegiate football players compared to healthy controls showed decreased hippocampal volume as well as slower reaction times regardless of concussion history but inversely related to the number of years played [29] . Other imaging studies have shown biochemical and cerebral blood flow abnormalities in contact sport athletes without a history of concussion. For instance, magnetic resonance spectroscopy demonstrated increases in choline, a putative marker of membrane turnover, and myo-inositol, a marker of glial activation, in former professional soccer players without a history of concussion [30] . In addition, a study of high school American football players showed alterations in neurochemistry with MR spectroscopy after a single season of play despite no documented concussions [31] . High school football players also showed alterations in cerebral blood flow that persisted postseason although no abnormalities in cognition were detected and any potential functional consequences of these alterations are unknown [32, 33] . Neuropsychological studies following a period of subconcussive injury in soccer have shown mixed results with some studies showing deficits [34] [35] [36] and others not [37] [38] [39] .Repetitive subconcussive injury can lead to the development of CTE. Despite a history of contact sports play and head impacts, symptoms associated with concussion are not always endorsed in subjects with CTE. In 16 % of subjects diagnosed postmortem with CTE, next-of-kin reported no concussions, suggesting that subconcussive head injury can be sufficient for development of disease. In our reported series of 92 cases of CTE [24\u2022\u2022] , multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that CTE tauopathy stage was significantly predicted by years of contact sports play (\u03b2=0.252, p=0.005) and age (\u03b2=0.505, p<0.001), but not the number of concussions (\u03b2=0.096, p= 0.284) or history of substance abuse (\u03b2=\u22120.111, p=0.223). This suggests that a prolonged period of subconcussive head injury drives the progressive development of CTE tau pathology. It further suggests that the recognition of concussion, while important, is not sufficient for properly identifying individuals at risk for CTE.", "citance": "A recent study of collegiate football players compared to healthy controls showed decreased hippocampal volume as well as slower reaction times regardless of concussion history but inversely related to the number of years played [29] .", "claims": [{"text": "College football players show decreased hippocampal volume and slower reaction times regardless of concussion history.", "subject": "College football players", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 197746713, "title": "Can the use of varenicline improve the efficacy of pharmacotherapy for nicotine addiction?", "abstract": "Abstract Introduction: Smoking is a huge medical and social problem in Poland, with as many as about 24% of Poles being addicted to nicotine. Approximately 6 million people worldwide die every year from conditions that are closely related to tobacco addiction, such as cancer and cardiovascular, metabolic or lung diseases. The difficulty in combatting nicotine dependence is largely due to the complex mechanism of this addiction. The motivation of a patient to quit smoking is of great importance in the difficult withdrawal process. Strengthening this motivation is one of the most important tasks of physicians and addiction therapists. Overview of literature: Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) has been the most widely known way to break away from smoking addiction for many years now. It involves delivering nicotine to the body in ways that are less harmful than through tobacco smoke. As a consequence, the cravings for nicotine are reduced, making it easier for the patient to break with the addiction. Clinical trials have shown that the use of NRT is associated with a 50-70% increased chance of maintaining abstinence from smoking compared to placebo. There are many NRT products, including nicotine chewing gum, nicotine patches, lozenges, dissolvable nicotine sticks, or inhalers. Bupropion is a selective dopamine\u2013noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor. This drug is one of the most commonly used in the pharmacotherapy of depression in the United States. At the same time, it has been found to have a positive effect on people trying to break up with the habit of smoking cigarettes. The mechanism of action remains unknown in this case, but studies clearly indicate the efficacy of bupropion, which is comparable to the efficacy of NRT. Varenicline is a partial agonist selective for \u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. It has a higher affinity for these receptors than nicotine. By stimulating them, it causes an increase in dopamine secretion (but to a lesser extent than cigarette smoking), helping in this way ease withdrawal symptoms. Conclusions: Varenicline has higher efficacy than bupropion and NRTs. Simultaneous use of two NRT forms increases the effectiveness of this method to a level comparable to varenicline. Contrary to previous reports, it seems that varenicline does not increase self-aggressive behaviour and the risk of suicide. The effectiveness of antinicotinic drugs depends on the sex of the patient. For both sexes, the most effective drug is varenicline. It is slightly more effective in women than in men. By contrast, NRT and bupropion show greater therapeutic potential in men.", "citation_paragraph": "There are many ways which combine pharmacological methods to help patients stop smoking. The best-known and most widely used combination therapies involve the use of various NRTs with varenicline or bupropion.Patients also readily opt for combination NRT. During such treatment, nicotine patches are used along with another aid such as chewing gum, tablets or inhalers. The action is based on the combination of a long-acting product that maintains a constant concentration of nicotine in the body, with a short-acting form taken as the need arises. The use of a combination of two NRTs is associated with a 30% greater chance of successful smoking cessation than in the case of monotherapy [40] .Replacement therapy can also be used together with bupropion. Studies have demonstrated that bupropion combined with nicotine patches shows greater efficacy than when it is used on its own. There are few reports on the combined use of bupropion and varenicline. One study showed that such combination therapy was more efficacious after 12 and 26 weeks of treatment than varenicline monotherapy, however, this was not associated with significantly higher long-term abstinence rates at 52 weeks of follow-up [41] . Studies of combination therapy using varenicline and NRT have so far yielded conflicting results, so their simultaneous use is not recommended [42, 43] . At the current state of knowledge, it seems that the only recommendable combination therapy is the use of two forms of NRT. It is an effective method, and its side effects are not stronger than those of nicotine monotherapy. Due to the limited number of studies, combining NRT with bupropion should be considered with great caution.", "citance": "One study showed that such combination therapy was more efficacious after 12 and 26 weeks of treatment than varenicline monotherapy, however, this was not associated with significantly higher long-term abstinence rates at 52 weeks of follow-up [41] .", "claims": [{"text": "Combination nicotine replacement therapies with varenicline or bupropion are not associated with significantly higher long-term abstinence rates at 52 weeks than varenicline monotherapy.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Data from 339 singleton pregnancies were retrospectively reviewed. HbA1c values were measured preconception and in each trimester. In a secondary analysis, use of CSII pre-pregnancy was compared with initiation of CSII during pregnancy.   RESULTS MDI was used in 140 pregnancies (41.3%) and CSII was used in 199 (58.7%), including 34 pregnancies (10.0%) during which the women switched to CSII. In pregnancies during which CSII was used duration of diabetes [median (interquartile range) 16.0 (8.0-23.0) years vs 11.0 (5.5-17.5) years; P<0.001] was longer, and the Institute of Medicine recommendations for appropriate weight gain were exceeded more often (64.8% vs. 50.8%; P=0.01). CSII use and pre-pregnancy BMI were independent predictors of excess weight gain. There was no difference in glucose control, but CSII was associated with higher birth weight [median (interquartile range) 3720 (3365-4100) g vs 3360 (3365-4100) g; P<0.001] and higher large-for-gestational-age (LGA) rate (44.7% vs. 33.6%; P=0.04) than MDI. HbA1c concentration in the third trimester and excess weight gain were predictive of LGA infants [odds ratio 2.33 (95% CI 1.54-3.51); P<0.001 and 1.89 (95% CI 1.02-3.51); P=0.04]. In pregnancies where CSII therapy was initiated in the first trimester and in those with pre-pregnancy use, similar glucose control and outcome was achieved.   CONCLUSIONS There was no advantage of CSII with respect to glycaemic control and neonatal outcomes. The rate of LGA neonates was higher in the CSII group, possibly mediated by excess maternal weight gain, which was more frequent than in women treated with MDI.", "citation_paragraph": "The present retrospective cohort of women using CSII or MDI in pregnancy comprised a larger proportion of CSII users compared with previous studies. We analysed maternal glucose control in each trimester and maternal and neonatal pregnancy outcomes. In addition, we evaluated a subgroup of women who changed to an insulin pump (CSII) in early pregnancy, which until now has rarely been addressed. We did not detect differences between women on MDI or CSII regarding glucose control as measured by HbA 1c levels before pregnancy and in each trimester. Both groups started with similar HbA 1c levels, which improved throughout pregnancy and most women achieved recommended HbA 1c targets from the second trimester onwards. Most randomized or retrospective cohort studies in pregnancy also found similar glycaemic control within treatment groups [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] ; however, others have reported significantly lower HbA 1c levels for women treated with CSII throughout the whole pregnancy [19, 20] . In one study the effect was limited to pregnancies of women with complicated diabetes [15] . The previous study with the largest number of CSII users in pregnancy came from Canada (CSII, n=113 vs MDI, n=218) and was conducted in the period 2006-2010 [19] . HbA 1c values were significantly higher in the MDI compared with the CSII group, leading the authors to conclude that insulin pumps had an advantage; however, in that study, women on MDI began pregnancy with a higher pre-conception HbA 1c , and this difference continued throughout pregnancy, although both groups improved their glucose control. We also note that there were baseline differences in the women by treatment group that may have influenced glucose control (significantly more smokers, less pre-conception care and less post-secondary education among women treated by MDI). A more recent study in a different cohort reported the opposite of the Canadian study, although only 40 women with CSII were involved [13] . In a comment on the study, the authors stated that a 0.5% difference between groups in maternal HbA 1c would require at least a sample size of 64 women in each arm and, for infant outcomes, a minimum sample size of 266 women (133 per arm) to demonstrate a reduction in the LGA rate from 50% to 30% [21] . The present study was large enough to examine glucose control, but we did not detect an advantage of CSII regarding the quality of glucose control. Despite similar glucose values, newborns from women with insulin pumps had higher birth weight and were more often LGA. HbA 1c in the third trimester and weight gain higher than the recommendation of the Institute of Medicine were predictive of LGA neonates. In turn, the risk of excess weight gain was determined by pre-pregnancy BMI and CSII use. Consequently, the high LGA rate with CSII use may be mediated by excess weight gain. Findings of higher LGA rates comparable to those of our study were previously seen in the study by Neff et al. [20] , with 31% vs 20% LGA neonates in 40 vs 424 pregnancies (P=0.03) in women receiving CSII vs MDI therapy, respectively. A similar effect observed in the Canadian study [19] (55.0% vs 39.2%; P=0.007) was attributed to confounding by parity. The relationship between fetal growth and glycaemic control appears to be quite complex and, even with good glycaemic control, LGA rates are still higher in pregnancies complicated by diabetes [22] . Numerous other factors must be also taken into account. Acceleration of weight gain, which had previously been shown to be a trigger for LGA neonates in women with Type 1 diabetes [23, 24] , might be a crucial side effect of the use of insulin pumps in pregnancy. With the exception of one study [18] , previous studies have reported similar weight gain between women using MDI and CSII [14, 15, 17, 19, 20] ; however, these studies did not report how many women gained weight in excess of the Institute of Medicine guidelines, which is a more relevant measure. The latter takes into account the maternal BMI at the beginning of pregnancy. A greater or lesser weight gain than that recommended in the Institute of Medicine guidelines has been shown to be associated with higher risks of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, with excess weight gain being associated with risk of LGA neonates [25] .Weight gain is a common issue in intensive insulin regimens. We speculate that a possible reason for the higher weight gain in CSII users might be higher carbohydrate intake and insulin dosage as a result of greater flexibility in insulin application and dietary freedom. In addition, in our experience, women on CSII tend to liberally correct even moderately elevated postprandial glucose values, which may increase the risk of subsequent hypoglycaemia and compensatory carbohydrate supply. We do not have accurate data to confirm this observation. Our finding of an association of excess weight gain with LGA neonates highlights the importance of providing counselling to women on CSII to carefully observe their weight gain, as well as regular dietary and physical activity coaching [26] . We also note that the adverse impact of excess weight gain may contribute to maternal and childhood obesity that may increase disease risk in later life [27] .Another focus of the present study was the concern that women might not be able to learn the effective handling of insulin pumps fast enough to attain optimal control when they change from MDI to CSII in early pregnancy; however, women who made this switch did reach similar glycaemic control throughout pregnancy. Data on this topic are scarce. Cyganek et al. [18] included 70 women who switched from MDI to CSII in the first trimester. No differences were observed in HbA 1c from the first to the third trimester or in birth weight between treatment groups (MDI vs CSII vs MDI/CSII), while higher weight gain rates were observed in both CSII groups. Despite the limitation of a small sample size, our findings may indicate that a change to CSII treatment in first trimester in women with inadequate control using MDI treatment can be safe and potentially beneficial.The main limitations of the present study concern its retrospective design. The insulin administration method was not randomly allocated but rather chosen according to patient and physician preference, thereby causing a potential selection bias. We also collected data from three tertiary centres specializing in diabetes in pregnancy, where a greater proportion of women might be very motivated to keep diabetes-related pregnancy complications to a minimum; however, these women may also have a higher risk profile. The present study population therefore might not be representative of women with less intensive care. Even though we cross-checked different data sources in order to complete participant data there were consistent gaps in some measurements, which affected the study's statistical power. Finally, as we did not have information on the quantity of insulin that women needed in pregnancy, we can only speculate on the potential influence of nutrition and insulin doses on weight gain in our study group. Outside pregnancy, the insulin dosage was 14% lower with CSII use [28] .In conclusion, in our large cohort of women with Type 1 diabetes, we did not observe an advantage of CSII over MDI in achieving either better glucose control or improved neonatal outcomes. In fact, LGA rates were higher with CSII use, and this was presumably related to excess weight gain. Our data provide important information to help women, clinicians and healthcare organizations to make an informed choice regarding insulin treatment in pregnancy. The additional cost of CSII for the healthcare system and the burden for the women who do not feel comfortable with an insulin pump should be given serious consideration because of both the lack of data showing benefit and the potential harm attributable to increased gestational weight gain. Use should be recommended on a case-by-case basis, as stated in the recent audit of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), which summarized the evidence up to the year 2017 [29] . Combined use of CSII and continuous glucose monitoring or closed-loop systems may contribute to more effective insulin pump use [30] .", "citance": "Combined use of CSII and continuous glucose monitoring or closed-loop systems may contribute to more effective insulin pump use [30] .", "claims": [{"text": "Combining use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and continuous glucose monitoring or closed-loop systems contributes to more effective insulin pump use.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Combining use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and continuous glucose monitoring or closed-loop systems reduces the effectiveness of insulin pump use.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}

They are transmitted by mealybugs and a few species by aphids in a semi-persistent manner. They are one of the most important plant virus groups and have emerged as serious pathogens affecting the cultivation of several horticultural crops in the tropics, especially banana, black pepper, cocoa, citrus, sugarcane, taro, and yam. Some badnaviruses are also known as endogenous viruses integrated into their host genomes and a few such endogenous viruses can be awakened, e.g., through abiotic stress, giving rise to infective episomal forms. The presence of endogenous badnaviruses poses a new challenge for the fool-proof diagnosis, taxonomy, and management of the diseases. The present review aims to highlight emerging disease problems, virus characteristics, transmission, and diagnosis of badnaviruses.", "citation_paragraph": "Commelina yellow mottle virus (ComYMV) is the type member of the genus Badnavirus. It infects the monocot weed, Commelina diffusa (day flower). The complete genome of the virus consists of 7489 bp with the three typical badnavirus ORFs capable of encoding proteins of 23, 15, and 216 kD [11] . Antibodies raised against the C-terminus of ORF I protein detected a 20 kD virus-specific protein at the surface of virions. This association was confirmed by immunosorbent electron microscopy and immunogold labeling. An antiserum raised against the putative ORF II gene product detected a 15-kD virus-specific protein confirming that also this one is virion-associated [26] . Through mutation studies, Tzafrir et al. [129] demonstrated that the N-terminal region of ORF III is required for systemic movement but not for replication of ComYMV. A construct containing 1.3 copies of the ComYMV genome was infective when introduced into C. diffusa through Agrobacterium-mediated infection. Analysis of the viral transcript indicated that the virus encodes a single terminally redundant genome-length-plus-120-nucleotide transcript [11, 129] . The ultrathin sections of infected plants showed the presence of tubular structures containing virions. The exterior of these tubules reacted with antibodies to ComYMV movement protein but not with antibodies to coat protein, indicating that they play a role in the cell-to-cell movement of virions [130] , as reported for several other plant viruses [131] .Medberry et al. [132] reported that the ComYMV promoter drives expression of GUS in transgenic tobacco primarily in the phloem, the phloem-associated cells, and the axial parenchyma of roots, stems, leaves, and flowers including anthers. Compared with the duplicated CaMV 35S promoter, the ComYMV promoter is 30% as active in tobacco and up to 25% in maize suspension cells. A study involving the transgenic expression of GUS driven by the ComYMV promoter in oats revealed that GUS expression was primarily localized in the vascular tissues of shoots, leaves, floral bracts, and roots [133] . Deletion analysis and functional studies of the ComYMV promoter in transgenic tobacco revealed the region between\u00b4870 bp and\u00b4232 bp to be responsible for the main promoter activity and the region downstream of it for tissue-(phloem-) specific expression [134] . Matsuda et al.

No metabolic biomarker is known and the mechanisms underlying premature aging are not fully understood. The present work aims to evaluate the metabolic alterations in HGPS using high resolution mass spectrometry. The present study analyzed plasma from six HGPS patients of both sexes (7.7 \u00b1 1.4 years old; mean \u00b1 SD) and eight controls (8.6 \u00b1 2.3 years old) by LC\u2013MS/MS in high-resolution non-targeted metabolomics (Q-Exactive Plus).

Our data show significant alterations in cellular energy use and availability, in signal transduction, and lipid metabolites, adding new insights on metabolic alterations associated with premature aging and suggesting novel putative biomarkers.", "citation_paragraph": "Aging is a complex biological process poorly understood at the molecular level. HGPS is a rare fatal disease where an extremely accelerated aging process is observed leading to premature death mainly related to cardiovascular complications. Despite great effort to increase knowledge about HGPS, biological biomarkers for this disease are not yet available, detailed disease mechanisms are still being investigated and there is currently no cure .The diagnosis of HPGS nowadays is based on signs and symptoms characteristic of the syndrome, such as impaired growth, baldness and skin alterations. Doctors usually identify HPGS children by abnormal growth curve chart, however, due to its low incidence, many doctors are not familiar with the syndrome. A genetic test for LMNA mutations can confirm the diagnosis of HPGS . Novel biomarkers that could diagnose HPGS prior to the establishment of the pathological process could potentially alter disease course. In the present work, we created ROC curve models to identify putative metabolic HPGS biomarkers. Biomarkers found to be statistically different between the HGPS and control groups are likely to be associated with premature aging based both on specificity and sensitivity. Targeted analysis using high purity standards of the metabolites of interest, previously identified in the non-targeted experiments, showed similar results in terms of statistical significance, reinforcing the likelihood of these metabolites representing biomarkers for HGPS.A number of investigations used this methodology to study the mechanisms underlying the aging progression, and whether strategies such as exercise training and hormonal treatment can revert the metabolic changes induced by aging. In a recent study by Houtkooper et al., metabolomic hallmarks of aging were demonstrated, including affected pathways in both liver and muscle tissues, indicating a significant modification in fatty acid metabolism (Houtkooper et al. 2011) . Aging metabolomic studies showed an increase in lactate and glucose suggesting changes in glucose/pyruvate and glycogen metabolism (Houtkooper et al. 2011) , in accordance with our data using HGPS plasma, where we observed an increase in glucose and lactide, a dimer of lactic acid (Table 1 ). Metabolomic studies in diabetic patients also demonstrate glucose and lactate increase (Crawford et al. 2010 ). In addition, we observed an increase in a long chain carnitine family molecule, Acetyl-l-Carnitine, associated with fatty oxidation. Interestingly, children in earlystage type 1 diabetes present elevated Acyl-Carnitine. Adult patients with type 2 diabetes may also present dysregulation of fatty acid oxidation, characterized by glucolipotoxicity (Mihalik et al. 2010) . In this context, it is interesting to note that a recent study demonstrated that metformin, a popular anti-diabetic biguanide, alleviates the nuclear defects and premature aging phenotypes in HGPS fibroblasts, perhaps constituting a promising therapeutic approach for life extension in HGPS (Park and Shin 2017) . Furthermore, insulin resistance has been described in children with HGPS (Rosenbloom et al. 1983) .Mitochondria are affected by several metabolic inborn errors as well as by the aging process, resulting in a decline in mitochondrial respiration (Houtkooper et al. 2011 , Thompson Legault et al. 2015 Dietzen et al. 2016) . Carnitine metabolites are important to mantein optium rate of fatty acid oxidation in the mitochondria, where the decline in carnitine precursors can decline the oxidation capacity, in the other hand, accumulation of carnitine metabolites can indicate pathological incomplete fatty acid oxidation processes. We found an 11 fold increase in Acetyl-l-Carnitine and also in L-carnitine in HGPS patients reflecting a broad dysfunction in \u03b2-oxidation, indicating a diminished lipid transport capacity in the mitochondria (Houten and Wanders 2010; Adams 2011) . Accordantly, we found that Beta-oxidation products of carnitine metabolites decreased in the plasma of HGPS, such as Decanoylcarnitine. Interestingly, fetal congenital disorders are associated with decreases in some carnitines, such as decanoylcarnitine among others (Bahado-Singh et al. 2014; Yu et al. 2018) . Collectively, these findings highlight the multiplicity of perturbations in lipid metabolism related to mitochondrial dysfunctions in HGPS. These metabolic alterations may be related to the growth abnormalities observed in HGPS children (Gordon et al. 2012) .During aging as well as in systemic metabolic dysfunction, amino-acid metabolism is significantly modified, including lterations in the levels of essencial amino acids such as valine and leucine, as well as, altered catabolic processes (Wang et al. 2011; Katz and Gerszten 2018) . Previous publications demonstrate that branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) as well as methionine content in the diet changes mice lifespan. In the present work, we identified altered amino acid availability in HGPS patients' plasma that was further investigated by targeted metabolomics. Our experiments showed a decrease in the levels of methionine and histidine, but in contrast levels of arginine and cystine were increased. Interestingly, Cheng and coworkers demonstrated that amino acids concentrations, such as histidine, might be related to human longevity (Cheng et al. 2015) . Regarding BCAA no changes were observed, as well as in other important amino-acids such as proline and alanine. In agreement with our findings, Houtkooper et al. showed that methionine is decreased in the plasma of aged mice and no changes were observed in BCAA (Houtkooper et al. 2011) .Altered metabolic processes can lead to the formation of toxic metabolites as well as alterations in acid-base equilibrium. Interestingly, the 4,6-dioxoheptanoic acid, also known as Succinylacetone, a medium-chain keto acid, and derivative metabolite, was found in higher levels in HGPS plasma. Succinylacetone can rise due to abnormal activity of the enzyme fumarylacetoacetase, being suggested as an acidogenic, oncometabolite and a metabotoxin. Of note, aging and progeria course with a hypertrophic cardiac process, that dramatically increases the risk of severe cardiac complications. In this context, patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are reported to have an increased level of this metabolite (Cyr et al. 2006; Adam et al. 2009 ).Our study has limitations imposed by the cohort size used. As indicated in methods/results, we analyzed only 6 HGPS patients' samples, a small number for a biomarker investigation. However, HGPS is an extremely rare disease, as emphasized by the fact that in a 200 million people country like Brazil, only two children with the disease have been identified. The five other samples from our cohort were donated by The Progeria Research Foundation which collects patients' samples worldwide. These samples come from children with different genetic backgrounds, most probably contain different contaminants, were subject to distinct sample handling procedures and time of storage. Human genome databases show that the interindividual differences are very extensive between distinct populations. From the 40.000.000 variant polymorphic DNA sites predicted, some are rare and present only in a person or his family, ethnicity or country, which may reflect in their plasma metabolome (Bouchard 2015) . Remarkably, in view of the expected variability and the great possibility that the diverse genetic backgrounds might influence the metabolic plasma levels, our approach based in the multivariate analysis of multiple metabolites was capable to clearly separate patients from controls, generating an important putative biomarker profile related to the disease, even using this very small sample size. Future work, analyzing serial plasma samples from HGPS patients obtained at different stages of disease progression may allow us to identify biomarkers that are related to disease progression. Availability of samples from patients treated with lonafarnib (a drug that decreases disease progression) may further improve identification of these biomarkers.In summary, the present work applied a powerful metabolomics pipeline based in liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry along with multivariate statistics and pathway analysis to identify putative circulating biomarkers for HGPS that may be interesting targets for pharmacological treatment, nutritional supplementation and for diagnosis and follow up of HGPS patients.", "citance": "Interestingly, Cheng and coworkers demonstrated that amino acids concentrations, such as histidine, might be related to human longevity (Cheng et al. 2015) .", "claims": [{"text": "Concentration of histidine is related to human longevity.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Concentration of histidine is uncorrelated with human longevity.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}
{"s2orc_id": 73510186, "title": "iPS-Cell Technology and the Problem of Genetic Instability\u2014Can It Ever Be Safe for Clinical Use?", "abstract": "The use of induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSC) as a source of autologous tissues shows great promise in regenerative medicine. Nevertheless, several major challenges remain to be addressed before iPSC-derived cells can be used in therapy, and experience of their clinical use is extremely limited. In this review, the factors affecting the safe translation of iPSC to the clinic are considered, together with an account of efforts being made to overcome these issues. The review draws upon experiences with pluripotent stem-cell therapeutics, including clinical trials involving human embryonic stem cells and the widely transplanted mesenchymal stem cells. The discussion covers concerns relating to: (i) the reprogramming process; (ii) the detection and removal of incompletely differentiated and pluripotent cells from the resulting medicinal products; and (iii) genomic and epigenetic changes, and the evolutionary and selective processes occurring during culture expansion, associated with production of iPSC-therapeutics. In addition, (iv) methods for the practical culture-at-scale and standardization required for routine clinical use are considered. Finally, (v) the potential of iPSC in the treatment of human disease is evaluated in the light of what is known about the reprogramming process, the behavior of cells in culture, and the performance of iPSC in pre-clinical studies.", "citation_paragraph": "Despite a large literature base supporting the view that single-nucleotide polymorphisms and CNV are not a threat [34, 109, 111, 113, 130, 131] , genomic aberrations are increasingly reported in hESC and iPSC-lines, and raise the possibility of de novo emergence of malignant neoplasia, particularly following receipt of autologous hiPSC-derived cells [132] . High-depth WGS of iPSC-lines revealed concentrations of SNV and CNV in stem-cell regulatory elements and binding sites of transcription factors, characterizing a regulatory landscape quite distinct from that of the founding cells [133] . Furthermore, WES of iPSC with ultra-deep amplicon sequencing of the parental fibroblasts, indicated that approximately 75% of mutations found in iPSC were acquired during cellular reprogramming and could be the result of oncogenic reprogramming factors and genotoxic stress [134] . This is in stark contrast to other WGS and WES studies of iPSC-lines concluding that non-germline SNV and short indels (insertions and deletions) arise mostly from the donor cells rather than during reprogramming [34, 109, 111, 113, 130, 131] .Nevertheless, the observation of the same aberrations common to iPSC and ESC from different source tissues (i.e., they are unlikely to be the result of random drift) is particularly worrying, as this may indicate selection for more proliferative clones in culture. For example, the common sub-chromosomal duplication in chromosome-20q was found to include Bcl-x L, an anti-apoptotic gene whose overexpression is known to enhance the survival of hESC [135] . Duplication of chromosome-12 is also common [136] ; this bears a Nanog pseudogene, which is the shortest region to be commonly duplicated in hPSC, suggesting that NanogP1 is expressed and confers an advantage for hPSC in vitro [137] . Trisomy of chromosomes 1, 12, 17, and X (denoted T1, et seq), and amplification of 20q have been detected in up to 34% of hPSC-lines karyotyped [138] ; such aberrations are also common in human carcinoma [139] , which is a clear safety concern.Failure to detect oncogenic mutations following iPSC reprogramming (see Section 3.3) is not necessarily a guarantor of the non-tumourigenicity of iPSC-therapies. Detection of oncogenic SNV depends on their prior recognition and inclusion in the cancer gene catalogues, which may not include all genes relevant to establishment of iPSC-derived cancers. Even if known a priori, it appears possible that oncogenic aberrations could evade detection. WES on 140 independent hES-lines, including 26 lines prepared following Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), for potential clinical use, suggested that researchers have \"unknowingly and routinely used hPS cells that harbored cancer-related missense mutations\" [140] . The WES revealed that 5% of the lines were entirely heterozygous for a TP53 mutation associated with cancer and autosomal dominant inactivation of P53, and five of the lines carried six mutations in TP53. In over 60% of cases the mutations were mosaic and so might not be detected by limited sampling for quality control. The TP53 mutations exhibited allelic frequencies ranging from 7-40%, suggesting their presence in 14-80% of cells in culture [140] .Furthermore, studies of RiPSC-lines have shown a notable concentration of mutations at binding sites for Polycomb Repressive Complex 2's catalytic component EZH2 [33] , and increased EZH2 activity is known to effect H3K27me3 accumulation leading to a repressive chromatin state. Although it is not known if the SNV reported confer gain-of-function, activating mutations in the SET domain of EZH2 are known to be oncogenic [141] . EZH2 up-regulation has been found in several cancers, including breast [142] , bladder [143] , prostate [144] , and non-Hodgkin lymphoma [145] . EZH2 may also have suppressive roles as inactivating mutations are found in some cancers, e.g., T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia [146] . Interestingly, EZH2 expression is correlated with Myc expression in prostate cancer [147] . Also of concern is the observation that SNV detected in study of iPSC were \"generally benign\" [81] , as even a single oncogenic SNV, if conferring a proliferative advantage, may rise to very high frequency (even to fixation, i.e., 100%) in an iPSC cell culture.Study of coding mutations in hiPSC-lines has indicated non-synonymous to synonymous substitution ratios in oncogenes similar to those in cancers, thus implying similar selection pressures on those genes in iPSC culture as in human cancers [34] . The same study revealed that all the SNV found were fixed in the iPSC populations; this may be a consequence of the population genetic bottleneck caused by hiPSC colony picking during cell-line production. The same bottlenecking could bring SNV occurring at very low frequency in the parent cell population to fixation in an iPSC-line [34] . The implication here is that hiPSC-lines may not represent the gene-pool of the patient's own cells, and so be of limited use in understanding the disease process, or not representative of normal autologous tissues in implants. The problem is compounded by the fact that over 300 iPSC-lines would be required to account for inter-patient variation in study of a disease [133] .Several protocol changes have been proposed to avoid genetic aberration during reprogramming. As well as improving the programming efficiency of episomal-vectors, culture at physiologic oxygen levels has been shown to reduce the frequency of aberrations [148] . Another study has found a MefMech (feeder layer of mitotically inactivated MEF, passaged by mechanical disassociation of colonies) technique to allow long-term passage and expansion of hiPSC with no detectable aberrations [73] , with similar improvement for hESC lines BG01 and BG02 [4] . A more innovative attempt at addressing genomic instability is the CryoPause approach. CryoPause allows synchronization of multiple hiPSC-lines, without need to maintain one while the others are expanded; they also avoid the need for multiple passages while safety assays are performed. CryoPause cells can be directly differentiated immediately after thawing, without need for recovery and expansion [149] . Further study is necessary to ensure that the CryoPause process itself does not induce aberrations, and that the method is reliable and robust.Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer (SCNT) may provide an alternative to iPSC that avoids the long periods in culture required by the reprogramming step, reduces the effect of epigenetic memory [150] , and produces cells that transcriptomically and epigenetically better resemble the ESC of the fertilized embryo [151] . Human SCNT also shows high efficiency compared with hiPSC reprogramming (2-5% [152, 153] ); however, SCNT requires sourcing of oocytes and manipulation of preimplantation embryos. Furthermore, not all studies report greater genome stability in SCNT reprogrammed lines. A comparison of seven such lines with seven isogenic iPSC-lines found no significant difference in terms of mutation frequency or epigenetic markers [154] . Another study compared SeV-vectored iPSC from HDF with ESC produced by SCNT on the same somatic cell culture, and included IVF-ESC (sharing the same mitochondria as the SCNT-ESC); the iPSC and SCNT-ESC were found to resemble one another in transcriptome, epigenetics and cardiac differentiation efficiency [155] . The observation of similar levels of SNV between iPSC and SCNT-ESC, despite the latter's shorter reprogramming time (generally 5-7 days [156] ), suggests that most of the genetic aberration could be a result of reprogramming rather than of rapid cell division. As iPSC production is more convenient, further work is required to determine if SCNT-derived lines are in fact more stable.", "citance": "High-depth WGS of iPSC-lines revealed concentrations of SNV and CNV in stem-cell regulatory elements and binding sites of transcription factors, characterizing a regulatory landscape quite distinct from that of the founding cells [133] .", "claims": [{"text": "Concentrations of SNV and CNV in stem-cell regulatory elements and binding sites of transcription factors in iPSC-lines are distinct from their founding cells.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 3281545, "title": "Epigenetic regulation in stem cell development, cell fate conversion, and reprogramming", "abstract": "Abstract Stem cells are identified classically by an in vivo transplantation assay plus additional characterization, such as marker analysis, linage-tracing and in vitro/ex vivo differentiation assays. Stem cell lines have been derived, in vitro, from adult tissues, the inner cell mass (ICM), epiblast, and male germ stem cells, providing intriguing insight into stem cell biology, plasticity, heterogeneity, metastable state, and the pivotal point at which stem cells irreversibly differentiate to non-stem cells. During the past decade, strategies for manipulating cell fate have revolutionized our understanding about the basic concept of cell differentiation: stem cell lines can be established by introducing transcription factors, as with the case for iPSCs, revealing some of the molecular interplay of key factors during the course of phenotypic changes. In addition to de-differentiation approaches for establishing stem cells, another method has been developed whereby induced expression of certain transcription factors and/or micro RNAs artificially converts differentiated cells from one committed lineage to another; notably, these cells need not transit through a stem/progenitor state. The molecular cues guiding such cell fate conversion and reprogramming remain largely unknown. As differentiation and de-differentiation are directly linked to epigenetic changes, we overview cell fate decisions, and associated gene and epigenetic regulations.", "citation_paragraph": "In contrast to the embryo-derived stem cells, various types of mammalian tissues harbor adult-type tissue-specific stem cells. One well-studied example is testis-specific spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), which support a continued production of sperm through self-renewal and differentiation (47, 48) . In the mouse, SSCs originate from primordial germ cells (PGCs) that develop in the genital ridges of embryos. After seminiferous cords are formed, the germ cells that reside inside the cords show different morphology from PGCs and are called gonocytes. After birth, gonocytes give rise to spermatogonia, including SSCs, a subpopulation of which is destined to differentiate and enter meiosis. Neonatal spermatogonia provide a source of cells for the longterm culture of spermatogonia in vitro (49) . These cells, termed germline stem cells (GSCs) can be maintained for a few years without losing stem cell activity. Furthermore, a population of GSCs can de-differentiate and become ESClike cells called mGSCs and gPSCs (50, 51) (Figure 1 ). Type A spermatogonia consist of single (A s ) cells, as well as two paired cells connected by an intercellular bridge (A pr ), or aligned cells of more than two interconnected cells (A al ) (52, 53) (Figure 2 ). This interconnection is a result of incomplete cytokinesis. The 'A s model' proposed that only A s cells are SSCs (54, 55) ; however, our recent data noted putative spermatogonial differentiation pivots at a dynamic, epigenetic switch point. This switch did not occur at the A s to A pr transition, but rather at the A al to A 1 transition, a point at which the cells begin to express the spermatogonial differentiation marker Kit (56) . Concomitant with the onset of Kit expression, the major DNA methyltransferases, Dnmt3a2 and Dnmt3b, and a component of histone H3K9 methylating complex, Glp, show a substantial increase. This is accompanied by the increase (as assessed by immunohistochemistry) in a global level of H3K9me2. These data suggest that A s , A pr and A al spermatogonia comprise a stem cell pool and that the epigenetic switch triggers the exit from stemness ( Figure  2 ). Consistent with this observation, another report suggests that connected chains of spermatogonia can also contribute to stem cell function through syncytial fragmentation (57) .These epigenetic properties of the male germ cell lineage might illuminate the nature of stem cells in other tissues. In skin epithelial tissues for example, bulge stem cells were initially believed to contribute to the entire epithelium during steady-state homeostasis in epidermal stem cells; however, updated lineage tracing and time-lapse experiments showed that stem cells are more heterogeneous and are detected in the hair follicle bulge, sebaceous gland, lower isthmus, and upper isthmus (58) . Thus, the epidermis seems to be regionally compartmentalized into functional units that are maintained autonomously by independent stem cells. Although each type of stem cell might express different stem cell markers, they possibly share epigenetic modifications characteristic of stem cells, so this information about stem cells in the epidermis might enable us to identify stem cells in other tissues. Figure 2 ) (56). Syncytial fragmentation supports continual interconversion between A s and connected chains of spermatogonia, which contributes to maintenance of the stem cell pool (57) . A major epigenetic switch triggers the cells to exit from the stem cell pool and differentiate (the cells leave the 'mountain top' on a one-way path to differentiation). As they emerge from the pool, differentiating spermatogonia display distinct epigenetic features (with high expression of Dnmt3a, 3b and Glp, as well as altered patterns of DNA methylation and H3K9me2) and express Kit (see text for details).In fact, the data implicates epigenetic changes as a key feature of artificially generated stem cells also, as specific methods can reverse the in vivo differentiation process. For example early experiments in somatic nuclear cloning demonstrated that the genome in a differentiated nucleus can be effectively reprogrammed (59-61). Yamanaka's method for generating iPSCs -reprogramming by introducing four transcription factors: Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc (OSKM) -put the tools for reprogramming into the hands of experimentalists (12) . Nevertheless many questions remain surrounding the molecular mechanisms controlling this phenomenon.Meanwhile, epigenomic analyses have highlighted important elements of efficient reprogramming. Efficient reprogramming can be blocked by the repressive histone H3K9 methylation (62) (63) (64) . Accordingly, reducing levels of H3K9 methyltransferases or overexpressing H3K9 demethylases can improve the efficiency of generating iPSCs. These results suggest that, as cells lose pluripotency and differentiate, the levels of repressive histone marks such as H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 increase, extending the repressive genomic regions.Histone modification comes into play because chromatin conformation must be properly remodeled for cells to acquire pluripotency. Remodeling is in part facilitated by the ATP-dependent, BAF chromatin-remodeling complex, which may also contribute to locus-specific epigenetic changes (65) . Moreover, when Mbd3, a core component of the Mbd3/NuRD (nucleosome remodeling and acetylation) complex, was depleted, efficiency of iPSC generation by OSKM reached \u223c100% (66). Mbd3 likely silences genes encoding core pluripotency factors, so loss of Mbd3 activates these genes, rendering them into an active and open-chromatin state (with high levels of H3K4me3 and H3K27 acetylation, and low levels of H3K27me3).DNA methylation serves as another barrier that must be overcome to achieve efficient reprogramming. Upon induction of OSKM, an elevated level of the Tet2 gene induces global hydroxylation of 5mC (67) . This likely helps promoters of pluripotency genes, such as Nanog and Esrrb, to lose methylation and become activated. This feature provides another layer of epigenetic control, which acts in concert with the others (listed above) to regulate key reprogramming.", "citance": "Consistent with this observation, another report suggests that connected chains of spermatogonia can also contribute to stem cell function through syncytial fragmentation (57) .These epigenetic properties of the male germ cell lineage might illuminate the nature of stem cells in other tissues.", "claims": [{"text": "Connected chains of spermatogonia contribute to stem cell function through syncytial fragmentation.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Information on the risk factors at the community level is of paramount importance to enable strategic preventive programs...", "citation_paragraph": "Type 2 diabetes has become a health priority in sub-Saharan Africa and continues to be a substantial public health problem worldwide [3] . Diabetes may result to disability, reduced life expectancy and high health costs [18] . The Maasai are a Nilotic ethnic group of nomads having a unique lifestyle and culture which may make them susceptible to T2D. They mainly consume animal products in particular meat, blood and milk [8] . A recent study compared prevalence of T2D among Maasai in rural (NCA)) and urban (Arusha City) and found marked differences between the two groups [9] . However, it was argued that the results obtained may not be representative of other rural Maasai living elsewhere. This is because the Maasai in NCA have high food shortages, cultivate and have reduced number of livestock due to the restrictive living regulations of NCA hence deviating from their traditional lifestyle. This study therefore focused on rural pastoral Maasai ethnic community in Simanjiro District in Tanzania. In this current study, the prevalence of T2D and IFG among the rural Maasai in Simanjiro District were at 0.9% (1.1% men and 0.8% women) and 2.5% (2.9% men and 2.3% women) respectively. The prevalence of T2D observed was much lower (0.9%) than that reported for rural Maasai in NCA (9.9%) [9] . This pattern may be due to the diversification of the diet in the rural Maasai in NCA as compared to the Maasai in Simanjiro District. Compared to other rural settings in Tanzania, our finding was similar to the low diabetic prevalence (1.5%) and IGT (1.2%) in Shari [19] but different from rural communities in Arumeru (T2D 9%, IFG 7.1%) [20] . The Maasai in the urban were reported to have a high T2D prevalence of 22.9% [9] . Other studies in urban settings also reported a high T2D prevalence of 11.9% [21] in Mwanza city, 9.8% among Hindu communities in Dar es Salaam [22] and 5.3% in Ilala [20] . This may be due to lifestyle changes due to urbanization.Fasting blood glucose was positively associated with obesity indicators (BMI, weight, and WC), SBP, DBP, heart rate, and main work. This is consistent with findings in other studies in Tanzania [9] [22] . Conversely, the number of fruit intake days per week was negatively associated with T2D.Overweight and obesity are a major risk factor of chronic diseases such as T2D. Fasting blood glucose was positively associated with BMI and WC which are measures of overweight and obesity. This was similar to the rural and urban Maasai in NCA and Arusha city respectively [9] . Overweight and obesity are associated with low grade inflammation characterized by increased circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and fatty acids. These interfere with normal insulin function inducing insulin resistance and eventually \u03b2 cell dysfunction [23] . Most participants were found to be of normal weight which may be attributable to the high physical activity levels of the Maasai in Simanjiro District.Diabetes and hypertension have been shown to coexist [24] . Hypertension accelerates diabetic complications. Diabetes damages and hardens the arteries which may contribute to high blood pressure. Elevation of insulin levels, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome adds oxidative stress leading to endothelial dysfunction a key component of hypertension [25] . Fasting blood glucose was positively associated with hypertensive SBP and DBP readings. This finding was consistent with the Maasai from Arusha city but not from NCA [9] . Greater consumption of whole fruits has been associated with reduced risk of T2D [26] . Fruit consumption was negatively associated with FBG among the Maasai. Fruit intake reduces the risk of weight gain which is a major risk factor for diabetes [27] .", "citance": "Greater consumption of whole fruits has been associated with reduced risk of T2D [26] .", "claims": [{"text": "Consumption of whole fruits increases the risk of type 2 diabetes.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Consumption of whole fruits reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes.

Saliva is the only mucosal fluid in which infectious HHV-8 has been identified, although factors associated with HHV-8 salivary shedding remain unclear. Our study performed PCR analysis for HHV-8 DNA in saliva (and other body fluids) in 66 HIV- and HHV-8-co-infected women without KS so that we could examine predictors for HHV-8 DNA detection. CD4 count was the most significant predictor of HHV-8 salivary shedding, with increased prevalence of HHV-8 salivary DNA at higher CD4 counts. The odds of salivary HHV8 shedding at CD4 counts > = 350 cells/microL was 63 times the odds of shedding at CD4 < 350 (95%CI, 1.3-3078), with an increase in effect size when the analysis was restricted to those with a CD4 nadir > 200. Analysis of these data suggests an increased potential for HHV-8 transmission early in HIV infection, with implications for HHV-8 prevention.", "citation_paragraph": "HHV-8 DNA was detected more frequently in saliva than in blood, genital fluids, or anal swabs from HIV/HHV-8 co-infected women. The rates of HHV-8 DNA shedding in various bodily compartments in our study are similar to shedding rates for KS-negative patients in other studies Calabr\u00f2 et al., 1999) . We further demonstrate that HHV-8 salivary shedding is most frequent in individuals with the least perturbed CD4 cell populations (current CD4 counts of > = 350 cells/L with a CD4 nadir that has never fallen below 200). Participants with current CD4 counts of > = 350 with a nadir of < 200 did not demonstrate a similar association, increasing the biological plausibility of more preserved CD4 cell populations positively influencing HHV-8 salivary shedding. Furthermore, the increase in effect size when more stringent CD4 count criteria are applied suggests that the association between a relative state of immunocompetence and HHV-8 DNA salivary shedding is real.The increase in HHV-8 salivary detection rates at higher CD4 counts is consistent with data demonstrating an increased probability for HHV-8 DNA detection in plasma at higher CD4 ranges (odds ratio for detection of HHV-8 plasma DNA for CD4 > = 200 vs. CD4 < 200 is 7.24 [95%CI, 1.30-40.4; Tedeschi et al., 2001] ). Only one other published report has analyzed the correlation between CD4 counts and HHV-8 salivary DNA detection ; this analysis was performed in a subset of HIV-positive men with clinical KS (sample size 23) and showed an odds ratio for salivary HHV-8 shedding at CD4 counts of > = 350 compared with CD4 counts < 350 of 2.3 (95%CI, 0.18-127; p 0.12). This study therefore allows for the possibility of a very strong association between CD4 counts and salivary shedding, consistent with our data. However, neither study was able to determine the precise magnitude of this effect, given the width of the confidence Box plots depict the median CD4 count with the 25% and 75% quartiles and ranges for participants in the study, who are classified as salivary shedders (participants at first subvisit with salivary DNA detetion, n = 17) and non-shedders (participants at first subvisit without salivary DNA detection, n = 49 (Kelsoe, 1996; Garside et al., 1998) ; circulating B-cells are a primary reservoir for HHV-8 replication (Monini et al., 1999) . Such germinal centers are located in the palantine and lingual tonsillar tissue in the oral cavity. Local gingival crevicular fluid cytokine and immunoglobulin levels may vary with peripheral CD4 count (Grbic et al., 1997) and might contribute to the amount of salivary HHV-8 replication in various states of immunosuppression. Moreover, enhanced HHV-8 replication may be secondary to a more effective Th1 helper response at higher CD4 counts. Interferon-\u2425 (IFN-\u2425) has been shown to induce lytic replication of HHV-8 (Chang et al., 2000; Mercader et al., 2000) . Since IFN-\u2425-producing T-cells decrease with CD4 + T-cell depletion (Kostense et al., 2002) , increases in salivary and plasma HHV-8 detection at higher CD4 counts may reflect more robust Th1 helper responses early in the course of HIV infection.The presence of infectious HHV-8 in saliva and the proclivity of the virus for salivary shedding imply that oral secretions are involved in transmission. Continued HHV-8 transmission among MSM in San Francisco, despite reductions in unprotected anal intercourse and HIV prevalence from 1978-96 (Osmond et al., 2002) , may be explained by orogenital contact. Sexual activities perceived as lower-risk (e.g., kissing, orogenital contact, oro-anal contact) may have continued in this population despite reductions in high-risk activities during that period. Orogenital contact is statistically associated with HHV-8 seroconversion in MSM (Dukers et al., 2000) . Analysis of our data suggests that HHV-8 transmission in HIV-infected individuals may be greater in early HIV infection, when CD4 cell populations are relatively intact. Since HHV-8 seroconversion in patients who are already HIV-infected increases the risk of developing KS compared with individuals who become HHV-8-infected prior to HIV (Jacobson et al., 2000) , further data on predictors for HHV-8 salivary shedding are greatly needed.Our study indicates a continued risk of HHV-8 transmission in HIV-infected individuals, even in relative states of immunocompetence. Longitudinal studies to assess changes in frequency of HHV-8 salivary shedding in HIV patients over time and with immune reconstitution on HAART may further elucidate these findings. A more detailed analysis of immunomodulatory mechanisms and HHV-8 replication in the oral cavity may help explain the positive association between peripheral CD4 counts and the degree of HHV-8 salivary shedding in HIV patients. Further data on CD4 count correlates of HHV-8 salivary shedding may have implications for HHV-8 transmission and prevention in the HIV-infected population.", "citance": "Continued HHV-8 transmission among MSM in San Francisco, despite reductions in unprotected anal intercourse and HIV prevalence from 1978-96 (Osmond et al., 2002) , may be explained by orogenital contact.", "claims": [{"text": "Continued HHV-8 transmission among MSM in San Francisco may be explained by urogenital contact.

{"s2orc_id": 51926661, "title": "The Potential of CRISPR/Cas9 Gene Editing as a Treatment Strategy for Alzheimer\u2019s Disease", "abstract": "Despite a wealth of knowledge gained in the past three decades concerning the molecular underpinnings of Alzheimer's disease (AD), progress towards obtaining effective, disease modifying therapies has proven to be challenging. In this manner, numerous clinical trials targeting the production, aggregation, and toxicity of beta-amyloid, have failed to meet efficacy standards. This puts into question the beta-amyloid hypothesis and suggests that additional treatment strategies should be explored. The recent emergence of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing as a relatively straightforward, inexpensive, and precise system has led to an increased interest of applying this technique in AD. CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing can be used as a direct treatment approach or to help establish better animal models that more faithfully mimic human neurodegenerative diseases. In this manner, this technique has already shown promise in other neurological disorders, such as Huntington's disease. The purpose of this review is to examine the potential utility of CRISPR/Cas9 as a treatment option for AD by targeting specific genes including those that cause early-onset AD, as well as those that are significant risk factors for late-onset AD such as the apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) gene.", "citation_paragraph": "These studies certainly set the table for future studies examining whether CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing can be used in patients with early onset AD, but what about sporadic AD, which by far, represents the vast majority of cases in the USA? In a preprint article that has not been peer-reviewed, Sun et al. attempted to edit endogenous APP at the extreme Cterminus to attenuate \u03b2-cleavage and beta-amyloid production [42] . In essence, they utilized CRISPR/Cas9 editing to target elimination of the C-terminal region of APP. The rationale for this approach is, as the authors have previously demonstrated, clipping off the C-terminal region of APP prevents a subsequent interaction with BACE-1 within endosomes, which is the first important cleavage event in generating beta-amyloid [43] . Their current findings in cell lines, cultured neurons, human iPSC-neurons and mouse brains all demonstrated the strategy works by limiting the physical association of APP with BACE-1 and attenuating beta-amyloid production [42] .The other major risk factor for developing late-onset AD is harboring the apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) allele [44] . Human apoE is polymorphic with three major isoforms, apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4, all of which differ by single amino acid substitutions involving cysteine-arginine replacements at positions 112 and 158 [45] . The E2 allele is the rarest form of APOE and carrying even one copy appears to reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's by up to 40%. The APOE3 is the most common allele and doesn't seem to influence risk, while the APOE4 present in approximately 10-15% of people, increasing the risk for AD and lowering the age of onset [46] . Having one copy of E4 (E3/E4) can increase your risk 2 to 3 times, while two copies of E4 (E4/E4) can increase the risk by 10-15 times [44] . It is noteworthy that 65-80% of all AD patients have at least one APOE4 allele [46, 47] . Finally, although many of the adverse effects of APOE4 appear to be associated with beta-amyloid [48] , a recent study supports that apoE4 may promote pathology such as tau phosphorylation in human iPSCderived neurons, independent of beta-amyloid [49] . The authors also showed that converting apoE4 to apoE3 by gene editing (utilizing zinc-finger nuclease-mediated gene editing not CRISPR/Cas9) prevented the pathology associated with apoE4 in their model system [49] . Therefore, one potential use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system could be to convert APOE4 to APOE2 or E3. In this regard structural and functional changes from apoE4 to apoE3 or apoE2 mediated through CRISPR/Cas9 may be a viable approach to treat AD patients carrying APOE4. Interestingly, although amino acid residues 112 and 158 (cysteine to arginine substitutions) determine the different isoforms of APOE, evidence suggests a major structural characteristic of apoE4 that distinguishes it from apoE2 and apoE3 is a domain interaction mediated by a salt bridge between Arg-61 and Glu-255 [50] . Therefore, the use of CRISPR/Cas9 to alter any one of these two amino acids may also be as effective in neutralizing the risk associated with harboring the APOE4 allele.", "citance": "The authors also showed that converting apoE4 to apoE3 by gene editing (utilizing zinc-finger nuclease-mediated gene editing not CRISPR/Cas9) prevented the pathology associated with apoE4 in their model system [49] .", "claims": [{"text": "Converting apoE4 to apoE3 by gene editing prevents the pathology associated with apoE4 in human iPSCderived neurons.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Converting apoE4 to apoE3 by gene editing worsens the pathology associated with apoE4 in human iPSCderived neurons.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}
{"s2orc_id": 11238984, "title": "Anatomy of mouse recombination hot spots", "abstract": "Genome-wide analyses have suggested thousands of meiotic recombination hot spots across mammalian genomes. However, very few hot spots have been directly analyzed at a sub-kb scale for crossover (CO) activity. Using recombinant inbred strains as a CO library, here we report the identification and detailed characterization of seven new meiotic hot spots on mouse chromosome 19, more than doubling the number of currently available mouse hot spots. Although a shared feature is the narrow 1.5-2.5-kb width of these recombinogenic sites, these analyses revealed that hot spots have diverse sequence attributes and distinct symmetric and asymmetric CO profiles. Interestingly, CO molecules with discontinuous conversion tracts are commonly observed, contrasting with those found in human. Furthermore, unlike human hot spots, those present in the mouse do not necessarily have a quasi-normal CO distribution but harbor CO repulsion zones within recombinogenic cores. We propose a model where local chromatin landscape directs these repulsion zones.", "citation_paragraph": "A major hurdle in defining the anatomy and activity of hot spot COs is finding hot spots that harbor sufficient polymorphisms that allow detailed profile analysis. Our findings indicate that polymorphisms at recombination hot spots are under-represented by some 200% in the SNP database. While there is no definitive explanation for this rather striking discrepancy, there appears to be a bias against exhaustive SNP assignment in highly polymorphic regions of the mouse SNP database (www .jax.org/phenome/SNP). However, there is a good correlation between the number of SNPs present in the database and the number of new polymorphisms identified (Pearson correlation r database SNP , new SNP = 0.875). The discovery of numerous new SNPs in a poorly polymorphic regions is therefore unlikely. Indeed, our most polymorphic hot spots (HS18.2, HS22, HS61.1 and HS61.2) are all located in the most polymorphic regions known between C57Bl/6J and DBA/2J ( Figure 1B) .The genomic diversity observed at all mouse hot spots ( Figure 3 ) is similar to that observed in the human genome from the HapMap project (16, 33) . We did not identify hot spots in the promoter regions of any genes, which distinguishes mammalian hot spots from those found in yeast (34) . Although the numbers of mouse hot spots thus far characterized at high resolution precludes the identification of any 'hot spot' motif, three of the hot spot cores (HS22, HS44.2 and HS61.2) have the degenerate 13-mer CCNCCNTNNCCNC sequence motif that has been previously associated with recombination hot spots and genome instability in humans (35) . This motif is detected at 400, 120 and 270 bp from the recombinogenic centers of HS22, HS44.2 and HS61.2, respectively. Intriguingly, the HS22 site is only present on the active C57Bl/6J chromosome. While this motif is only correlative, it may suggest that a common trans-acting factor shared between mice and human targets a subset of recombinogenic sites to render them permissive to Spo11-initiated DSB formation, in a manner akin to the ADE6-M26 hot spot in S. pombe (36) . Indeed, in this scenario, recombination initiation appears to be controlled by a set of histone acetyltransferase and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors that alter chromatin structure (37) . The precise mapping of hot spot cores to a sub-1-kb resolution using alternative methodologies, for example those defining single-strand DNA-associated DSBs (34) or Spo11-bound sequences (38) , should allow the field to determine if any recurrent motif sequence is present at mouse recombination hot spots.", "citance": "We did not identify hot spots in the promoter regions of any genes, which distinguishes mammalian hot spots from those found in yeast (34) .", "claims": [{"text": "Crossover hot spots are found within gene promoters in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Crossover hot spots are not found within gene promoters in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}
{"s2orc_id": 67862456, "title": "Innate Lymphoid Cells: A Link between the Nervous System and Microbiota in Intestinal Networks", "abstract": "Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are a novel family of innate immune cells that act as key coordinators of intestinal mucosal surface immune defense and are essential for maintaining intestinal homeostasis and barrier integrity by responding to locally produced effector cytokines or direct recognition of exogenous or endogenous danger patterns. ILCs are also involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Many studies have demonstrated the occurrence of crosstalk between ILCs and intestinal microbiota, and ILCs have recently been shown to be connected to the enteric nervous system (ENS). Thus, ILCs may act as a key link between the nervous system and microbiota in intestinal networks. In this review, we briefly summarize the role of the ILCs in the intestinal tract (particularly in the context of IBD) and discuss the relationship between ILCs and the microbiota/ENS.", "citation_paragraph": "Many studies have examined the roles of ILCs in the intestinal tract with a focus on their relationships with the intestinal microbiota. The gut microbiota is an essential component of the intestine, and its highly dynamic balance is vital for maintaining intestinal health and preventing chronic inflammation. The ratio of bacteria to human cells is approximately 1 : 1 based on the recent estimates, most of them are from the intestines, with an amount of about 10 14 bacteria [77] . These bacteria form the gut microbiota [78] , which plays an important role in human health and disease [79] .ILCs and the gut microbiota communicate with each other in an indirect manner via cytokine signaling, and these signals also combine with signals from intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and macrophages. The symbiotic microflora can influence the differentiation of ILCs by inducing the expression of intestinal cytokines. Moreover, ILCs react to the gut microbiota by changing their structure, having protective or destructive effects on gut immunity. Among ILCs, the most important with regard to the gut microbiota are ILC3s. Signals that originate from commensal microorganisms affect the maturation of ILCs and the acquisition of the tissue-specific functions by ILCs. Many studies have shown that the microbiota is indispensable for differentiating ILCs and producing IL-22 [50] . IL-22 production by ILC3s also maintains the balance of the microbiota during early colonization resistance against pathogens [80] . Moreover, ILC3s are known to produce IL-22 to protect the body during Citrobacter rodentium-induced colitis [50] , and IL-22 drives antimicrobial peptide expression and is required for the prevention of severe intestinal pathology and mortality during C. rodentium-induced colitis [81] . Interestingly, even in lymphocyte-replete hosts, mice lacking ROR\u03b3t + ILCs die from C. rodentium infection, although IL-22 can also be produced by Th-17 cells [82] .The gut microbiota can stimulate macrophagocytes to secrete IL-\u03b2, which can induce ROR\u03b3t + ILCs to produce IL-22 [83] . Commensal bacteria directly interact with IECs. Additionally, a germ-free mouse experiment showed that the process of IL-7 secretion by IECs depends on the gut microbiota and that IL-7 is indispensable for promoting cytokine secretion from ILC3s [83] . IECs also secrete IL-25 following stimulation by gut microbiota, and IL-25 decreases the production of IL-22 by ILC3s [83] . IL-22 produced by ILC3s can promote the production of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) secreted by IECs, thereby limiting symbiotic bacteria, and can regulate the anatomic location of lymphoid symbiotic bacteria [81, 84, 85] . Furthermore, IL-22 derived from ILC3s induces fucosylation in IECs, promoting host protection against enteric pathogens [86] and facilitating the establishment of a healthy intestinal microflora by inhibiting the growth of pathogenic bacteria and conditioned pathogens and preventing damage to the gut tissue [87] . In addition, microbial sensing and production of IL-1\u03b2 by intestinal macrophages drive the secretion of CSF2 by ILC3s, which is needed for macrophage function and the stimulation of oral tolerance [63] . Additionally, the levels of specific Alcaligenes IgG in pediatric patients with CD are significantly increased, and the production of IL-22-dependent AMPs inhibits intestinal Alcaligenes, indicating that ILC3s play important roles in maintaining intestinal microenvironmental homeostasis [88] .AHR is essential for stimulating innate gut immunity by controlling ROR\u03b3t + ILCs [89, 90] . ROR\u03b3t + ILCs increased apoptosis in AHR-deficient mice, together with less production of IL-22 and the mice were particularly prone to infection with C. rodentium [89, 91] . Consumption of ILCs leads to infection by commensal bacteria and systemic inflammation, and these events can be suppressed by modulation of IL-22 [88] . Based on these results, ROR\u03b3t + ILC3s and IL-22 secretion play vital roles in intercommunication among cells [88, 92] . Importantly, ILCs and symbiotic microbes can immediately intercommunicate via Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation. TLR2 expressed on the surface of CD127 + LTi-like ILCs can identify bacterial signals, permitting direct sensing of microbial cells [93] . ILCs may also interact with bacterial components through NCRs [94] . For example, NKp46 and NKp44 have been shown to immediately bind to epitopes of Fusobacterium nucleatum or Mycobacterium tuberculosis [95] . The activity of other ILC subsets can also be affected by microbiota. ROR\u03b3t + ILCs are stimulated by epithelial tuft-cell-derived IL-25 [18] in a microbiota-dependent manner [96] . Furthermore, crosstalk between DCs and ILCs would be important in the regulation of intestinal homeostasis, such as confrontation with H. typhlonius-driven inflammation, and T-bet, a T-box family transcription factor, plays a crucial role in regulating this interaction [97] .", "citance": "Furthermore, crosstalk between DCs and ILCs would be important in the regulation of intestinal homeostasis, such as confrontation with H. typhlonius-driven inflammation, and T-bet, a T-box family transcription factor, plays a crucial role in regulating this interaction [97] .", "claims": [{"text": "Crosstalk between dendritic cells (DCs) and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) is important in the regulation of intestinal homeostasis.", "subject": "regulation of intestinal homeostasis", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 15783590, "title": "Role of p53 in Cell Death and Human Cancers", "abstract": "p53 is a nuclear transcription factor with a pro-apoptotic function. Since over 50% of human cancers carry loss of function mutations in p53 gene, p53 has been considered to be one of the classical type tumor suppressors. Mutant p53 acts as the dominant-negative inhibitor toward wild-type p53. Indeed, mutant p53 has an oncogenic potential. In some cases, malignant cancer cells bearing p53 mutations display a chemo-resistant phenotype. In response to a variety of cellular stresses such as DNA damage, p53 is induced to accumulate in cell nucleus to exert its pro-apoptotic function. Activated p53 promotes cell cycle arrest to allow DNA repair and/or apoptosis to prevent the propagation of cells with serious DNA damage through the transactivation of its target genes implicated in the induction of cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. Thus, the DNA-binding activity of p53 is tightly linked to its tumor suppressive function. In the present review article, we describe the regulatory mechanisms of p53 and also p53-mediated therapeutic strategies to cure malignant cancers.", "citation_paragraph": "Since p53 exerts its biological function through its target gene products, it is quite important to identify p53-target gene products and also to elucidate the functional significance of them. In this section, we describe the functional significance of the representative p53-target gene products.The cell cycle inhibitor p21 has been discovered by four independent research groups. (Cdk-interacting protein) as a Cdk2 (Cyclin-dependent kinase 2)-binding protein [72] . p21 CIP1 tightly binds to Cdk2 and inhibits its protein kinase activity to block the phosphorylation of tumor suppressor pRB (retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product). Xiong et al. compared the subunit composition of Cdk/cyclin complexes between normal and transformed cells, and found that p21 is frequently lost from multiprotein complex derived from transformed cells [73] . Alternatively, Noda et al. identified p21 SD1 by using expression screening from senescent human diploid fibroblasts [74] . p21 SD1 (senescent cell-derived inhibitor) blocks DNA synthesis and maintains the senescent phenotype. Now, we call it p21 WAF1 . In response to cellular stresses, p53 induces G1 cell cycle arrest through the up-regulation of p21 WAF1 . Hermeking et al. described that a negative cell cycle regulator 14-3-3\uf073 is induced in response to DNA damage in a p53-dependent manner and involved in the induction of G2/M arrest [75] . Further studies demonstrated that 14-3-3\uf073 antagonizes Mdm2-mediated p53 degradation and p53 nuclear export [76] . Ohki et al. discovered a novel p53-target gene product termed Reprimo [77] . Reprimo is a highly glycosylated cytoplasmic protein which induces G2 arrest. Similarly, Tanaka et al. isolated p53-inducible gene product termed p53R2 with a significant sequence similarity to the ribonucleotide reductase small subunit (R2) [78] . Subsequent studies demonstrated that p53R2 is induced in response to a variety of DNA damage and causes G2/M arrest.p53 is tightly maintained at extremely low level under normal conditions. MDM2 targets p53 for ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation [6] [7] [8] . Barak et al. reported that MDM2 is one of the transcriptional target genes of p53 [79] . Thus, MDM2 participates in a negative auto-regulatory feedback loop, which controls p53 expression level.Since p53-dependent apoptosis is mediated by mitochondrial dysfunction, p53-inducible mitochondria proteins are of particular interest. We describe here BAX (Bcl2-associated X protein), p53AIP1 (p53-regulated apoptosis-inducing protein 1), NOXA (Latin for damage) and PUMA (p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis). Selvakumaran et al. found that BAX (Bcl2-associated X protein) is an immediate early p53-responsive gene [80] . BAX is normally distributed in cytoplasm or loosely associated with mitochondrial membrane. Upon stimulation of apoptosis, BAX is induced to undergo conformational change followed by formation of membrane-inserted homo-oligomers that results in the outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and the releases of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane space to cytosol [81] . Oda et al. identified p53AIP1 as one of the p53-target gene products [82] . p53AIP1 which is localized within mitochondria, promotes apoptosis through affecting the mitochondrial membrane potential, and thereby releasing cytochrome c [83] . p53-dependent up-regulation of p53AIP1 is tightly associated with p53 phosphorylatyion at Ser-46. NOXA has been rediscovered in a differential display approach [84] . NOXA is induced in response to DNA damage in a p53-dependent manner. It has been shown that two domains (BH3 domain and mitochondrial targeting domain) in Noxa are essential for the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria [85] . PUMA has been identified as one of p53-target gene products [86, 87] . PUMA is detectable exclusively in mitochondria and is associated with pro-survival Bcl2 through its BH3 domain. PUMA induces apoptosis through the dysfunction of mitochondria. Jeffers et al. found that BAX is required for PUMA-mediated apoptosis, placing BAX downstream of PUMA [86] .", "citance": "Upon stimulation of apoptosis, BAX is induced to undergo conformational change followed by formation of membrane-inserted homo-oligomers that results in the outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and the releases of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane space to cytosol [81] .", "claims": [{"text": "Cytochrome c is released from the mitochondrial intermembrane space to cytosol during apoptosis.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Cytochrome c is transferred from cytosol to the mitochondrial intermembrane space during apoptosis.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}
{"s2orc_id": 23579120, "title": "Differential expression of the MHM region and of sex-determining-related genes during gonadal development in chicken embryos.", "abstract": "The chicken (Gallus gallus) embryo has been used as a classic model system for developmental studies because of its easy accessibility for surgical manipulation during embryonic development. Sex determination in birds is chromosomally based (ZZ for males and ZW for females); however, the basic mechanism of sex determination is still unknown. Here, the dynamics of expression of candidate genes implicated in vertebrate sex determination and differentiation were studied during embryonic chicken gonadal development. Gene expression profiles were obtained before, during, and after gonadal sex differentiation in females and males for DMRT1, SOX3, SOX9, DAX1, SCII, HINTZ, HINTW, and the male hypermethylated (MHM) region. Transcripts for the HINTZ, DMRT1, DAX1, SCII, and SOX9 genes were observed in both sexes, but expression was higher in male gonads and may be correlated with testicular differentiation. The expression patterns of HINTW, SOX3, and MHM suggest that they may act in ovary development and may be involved in meiosis entry. MHM was upregulated and DMRT1 was downregulated in females at the same developmental stage. This may indicate a regulation of DMRT1 by MHM ncRNA. Similar dynamics were observed between HINTW and HINTZ. This study reports on the MHM expression profile during gonadal development and its correlation with the expression of genes involved in vertebrate sex determination.", "citation_paragraph": "The SOX3 gene maps to chromosome 4 of G. gallus and is expressed in both sexes during HH28 and HH40 stages with elevated levels at the time of sexual differentiation (i.e., between HH30 and HH35), indicative of a role of SOX3 in both sexes (Smith et al., 1999) . Our results suggest that SOX3 expression in the female gonads may have an important role in sex differentiation. Further studies in chicken (between 30 and 35HH stages) may elucidate the function of SOX3 in birds. Its expression detected in mesonephric tissue (somatic cell lineage) was in agreement with previous expression data for mammals (Weiss et al., 2003) .The SOX9 gene is expressed during testicular development in birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish. Unlike SRY, the SOX9 gene has been hailed as the first truly conserved element of the vertebrate sex-determining cascade, controlling Sertoli cell differentiation and responding to distinct upstream triggers in the different groups (Smith and Sinclair, 2001) . Our data were in agreement with semi-quantitative PCR studies previously performed by other authors (Smith et al., 1999) . SOX9 displayed differential expression patterns in gonadal tissue ( Figure  2B ), and it was also expressed in mesonephric and cardiac tissues (Tables 3 and 4) , indicating other functions of this gene besides its role in gonadal development. According to our results and reports from the literature (Smith and Sinclair, 2001; Agrawal et al., 2009; Sekido and Lovell-Badge, 2009; Bagheri-Fam et al., 2010; Carr\u00e9 et al., 2011) , SOX9 expression in birds may be important for testicular development. Other studies have shown that DAX1 expression was higher in females than in males at HH30-HH32 (Smith et al., 1999 (Smith et al., , 2000 Yamamoto et al., 2003) . Accordingly, our data showed elevated female expression of DAX1 at HH35, but also higher expression in male gonads at HH40 ( Figure 2C ). Our data may indicate a role of DAX1 in ovarian development and some function related to male development, indicated by DAX1 upregulation in male gonads at HH40.The higher SCII expression in cardiac and mesonephric male tissues indicated that SCII eludes a probable dosage compensation mechanism for gene expression from the Z chromosome. In gonadal tissue, SCII expression was upregulated in females before the onset of morphological differentiation (HH20-25), and at HH28 (corresponding to the start of morphological differentiation), the levels of expression were higher in males and further increased at HH40 ( Figure 3A and Table 2 ). The expression dynamics in gonadal tissues observed here suggest a role for SCII in gonadal development or in sex-determination itself. The expression pattern of SCII did not indicate that this gene is related only to testicular differentiation, as suggested previously (McQueen et al., 2001) , and SCII may participate in ovarian development.HINTZ expression was slightly upregulated at the HH35 stage in gonadal tissue in females ( Figure 3B ). The highest level of HINTZ expression was noted in males at the HH40 stage (post-differentiation) and decreased in gonadal adult tissues of both sexes ( Figure 3B ). Previous studies (Yamada et al., 2004) and our results showed low HINTW expression in gonadal regions, during the HH20, HH25, and HH28 stages ( Figure 3C ). We describe here for the first time that HINTW expression in female gonads peaked at HH35. Interestingly, at HH40, the male gonad showed strong upregulation of HINTZ. These results could indicate an inhibitory effect of HINTZ that could regulate the HINTW expression on females at HH40. Until now, endogenously produced HINTW protein has not been detected, although recombinant HINTW could be over-expressed in bacteria (Moriyama et al., 2006) . One possibility is that HINTW transcripts are not translated and act as an ncRNA. In addition, HINTW is expressed throughout the embryo at extragonadal sites, such as the central nervous system and myotomes (Scholz et al., 2006 , Smith, 2007 , and our data indicated expression in mesonephric and cardiac tissue (Tables 3 and 4) .In chicken, the DMRT1 gene maps to the Z chromosome and has no homologue on the W chromosome (Nanda et al., 1999; Raymond et al., 1999) . In the present study, we observed that DMRT1 expression was upregulated in males and its levels were maximal at HH40 (4-fold higher than in females). The adult testis showed similarly high levels of DMRT1 expression, which could indicate that DMRT1 functions in spermatogenesis. Our data were in agreement with results of a recent study where expression of DMRT1 was knocked down with the use of RNA interference in early embryos, resulting in feminization of the embryonic gonads in genetically male (ZZ) embryos (Smith et al., 2009 ). In conclusion, DMRT1 is probably involved in the regulation of testicular differentiation.Similar to some studies that have shown female-specific expression of MHM, we detected its expression only in the female gonadal tissue (Teranishi et al., 2001; Bisoni et al., 2005; Roeszler et al., 2012) (Figure 4B ). We detected MHM expression almost exclusively in the female tissues ( Figure 4B and Tables 2-4), as has also been observed in previous studies (Teranishi et al., 2001; Bisoni et al., 2005; Roeszler et al., 2012) . We did not detect MHM expression in male gonadal tissues, which contradicts observations by Carr\u00e9 et al. (2011) . However, mesonephric and cardiac tissues at HH35 and HH40 showed basal levels of MHM transcripts (Tables 3 and 4) , which may be explained by our method having higher sensitivity than those used in previous analyses (Teranishi et al., 2001) , and this may be related to differential, tissuedependent methylation of MHM. The expression profile of the MHM region in the gonadal region showed that its expression was unchanged during the initial stages and that MHM expression was upregulated at HH40 when gonadal differentiation takes place. MHM expression decreased in the adult ovary ( Figure 4B ).The expression of MHM in females, and its accumulation near its locus, may be important in female development, and provide a regulatory mechanism similar to Xist RNA in mammals and to roX1 and roX2 RNAs in Drosophila, which represent two well-studied examples of ncRNA transcript components as part of mechanisms for compensating gene dosage.In our study, the expressions from the MHM region ( Figure 4B ) and of the DMRT1 gene ( Figure 4A ) were compared in gonadal tissue, and we verified that in females, RNA levels of MHM were increased at the same time as DMRT1 expression was downregulated. Similarly, recombinant expression from an exogenous plasmid containing 2 kb of the chicken MHM region in the left testes of 13-week-old roosters resulted in decreased DMRT1 expression (Yang et al., 2010) . Nevertheless, expression of others candidate genes, such as SOX9, did not change in these tissues (Yang et al., 2010) . Recently, Roeszler et al. (2012) observed that retroviral-mediated mis-expression of MHM in males induces disruption of testis development, but does not induce feminization. MHM mis-expression also affects the gonadal expression of DMRT1 (Roeszler et al., 2012) . This suggests that MHM ncRNAs could specifically regulate the expression of its neighboring genes, including DMRT1 (Teranishi et al., 2001; Yang et al., 2010) . Recently, DMRT1 was shown to be a sex-determining gene (Zhao et al., 2010) , and from our data and those of the literature we suggest that direct epigenetic regulation of DMRT1 by the MHM region may be involved in determining sex in G. gallus.", "citance": "Recently, DMRT1 was shown to be a sex-determining gene (Zhao et al., 2010) , and from our data and those of the literature we suggest that direct epigenetic regulation of DMRT1 by the MHM region may be involved in determining sex in G. gallus.", "claims": [{"text": "DMRT1 is a sex-determining gene that is epigenetically regulated by the MHM region.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Here we demonstrate their RNA polymerase activities in vitro. Unlike Pol II, Pols IV and V require an RNA primer, are insensitive to \u03b1-amanitin, and differ in their ability to displace the nontemplate DNA strand during transcription. Biogenesis of 24 nt small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which guide cytosine methylation to corresponding sequences, requires both Pol IV and RDR2, which physically associate in vivo. Whereas Pol IV does not require RDR2 for activity, RDR2 is nonfunctional in the absence of associated Pol IV. These results suggest that the physical and mechanistic coupling of Pol IV and RDR2 results in the channeled synthesis of double-stranded precursors for 24 nt siRNA biogenesis.", "citation_paragraph": "Our results provide biochemical demonstrations of RNA polymerase activity for Pol IV, Pol V, and RDR2. Pol IV and RDR2 physically associate, and we find that RDR2 activity is dependent on this association, suggesting that Pol IV and RDR2 activities are coupled, thereby channeling RNA intermediates early in the 24 nt siRNA-directed DNA methylation pathway.Compared to Pol II, the transcriptional activity of Pol IV and Pol V is relatively weak. One possibility is that cofactors that increase Pol IV and Pol V activity do not copurify with the polymerases. Pols IV and V also have numerous amino acid substitutions or deletions at positions that are invariant, or highly conserved, in Pols I, II, and III, which might compromise their activities. Compared to Pol IV, associated RDR2 activity is strong. Lowabundance Pol IV transcripts might be amplified significantly by RDR2 in vivo, particularly if RDR2 can use its own transcripts as templates. If so, Pol IV's RNA polymerase activity may not need to be particularly robust.Thus far, we have been unable to detect significant Pol IV or Pol V transcription in vitro in the absence of an RNA primer. A trivial explanation could be that Pols IV and V require unidentified cofactors that are not needed by Pols I, II, or III to initiate transcription using sheared genomic DNA or other DNA templates. However, the mislocalization of Pols IV and V, but not Pol II, in nuclei treated with RNase A is consistent with an involvement of RNA as a template or primer . Abortive transcripts or persistent RNA-DNA hybrids resulting from Pol II transcription, or small RNAs that invade duplex DNA to generate R loops, are potential sources of DNA-RNA hybrid templates.Pol V's ability to carry out transcription using the bipartite oligonucleotide template, but not the tripartite template, suggests an inability to disrupt downstream dsDNA during transcription. The potential ramifications of this observation in vivo are intriguing. We've shown that DRD1, a putative chromatin remodeler in the SWI2/SNF2 protein family, and DMS3, a protein that shares homology with the hinge domain region of cohesin and condensin ATPases, enable Pol V transcription in vivo (Wierzbicki et al., 2008 . These proteins interact with RDM1 , a single-stranded DNA binding protein (Gao et al., 2010) , suggesting that the complex may play a role in generating, and stabilizing, melted duplex DNA regions to provide Pol V with a single-stranded template. Further development of Pol V in vitro transcription assays should allow tests of this hypothesis.", "citance": "We've shown that DRD1, a putative chromatin remodeler in the SWI2/SNF2 protein family, and DMS3, a protein that shares homology with the hinge domain region of cohesin and condensin ATPases, enable Pol V transcription in vivo (Wierzbicki et al., 2008 .", "claims": [{"text": "DMS3 protein enables Pol V transcription in vivo.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "DRD1 proteins enable Pol V transcription in vivo.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Similarly, more than 20 species of nondomestic felids and African hyenids demonstrate seroreactivity against feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) antigens. While it has been challenging to study the biological implications of nonfatal infections in natural populations, epidemiologic and clinical studies performed thus far have only rarely detected increased morbidity or impaired fecundity/survival of naturally infected SIV- or FIV-seropositive versus -seronegative animals. Cross-species transmissions of these agents are rare in nature but have been used to develop experimental systems to evaluate mechanisms of pathogenicity and to develop animal models of HIV/AIDS. Given that felids and primates are substantially evolutionarily removed yet demonstrate the same pattern of apparently nonpathogenic lentiviral infections, comparison of the biological behaviors of these viruses can yield important implications for host-lentiviral adaptation which are relevant to human HIV/AIDS infection. This review therefore evaluates similarities in epidemiology, lentiviral genotyping, pathogenicity, host immune responses, and cross-species transmission of FIVs and factors associated with the establishment of lentiviral infections in new species.

The identification of an SIV vif cellular target, a member of the cytidine deaminase APOBEC family, has permitted a better understanding of species restrictions on the emergence of lentiviral infections. The cellular deaminase is incorporated into the lentiviral virion during reverse transcription to direct the deamination of cytidine to uridine on the minus strand of viral DNA (200) . This deamination results in catastrophic G-to-A mutations in the viral genome, determining inactivation (157, 215, 237, 411) and/or degradation (348) of the viral genome. Two primate APOBEC family members (APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F) are believed to play a central role in antagonizing viral replication because they are expressed in natural targets of HIV-1 infection, including lymphocytes and macrophages. However, lentiviruses are able to successfully infect and replicate in host target cells containing APOBEC when host-adapted viral Vif interferes with this mechanism. This Vif activity is species specific, i.e., human APOBEC3G is inhibited by HIV-1 Vif but not by SIVagm Vif, whereas AGM APOBEC3G is inhibited by SIVagm Vif but not by HIV-1 Vif. Several recent studies identified the mechanism of this specificity and showed that a single amino acid change can alter the ability of Vif to interfere with APOBEC activity (45, 332, 406) . The mechanism of this reaction is complex and is still being investigated intensively.While the aforementioned studies were dissected using in vitro methodology, recent studies have demonstrated that when domestic cats are infected with puma FIV, the proviral genome progressively accumulates a large error burden with a large proportion of G-to-A mutations, suggestive of enhanced in vivo cytidine deaminase activity, which would be predicted for an infecting virus harboring a nonadapted Vif protein (313) . The domestic cat analogue of APOBEC3G has been identified as fe-3 (229); this protein has been shown to exhibit cytidine deaminase properties. Thus, it is conceivable that cross-species transmission of FIVpco to domestic cats is limited by the capacity of puma lentiviral Vif to overcome cytidine deaminase activity. Interestingly, in the same study, selective pressure on specific residues in Pol, but not in other viral structural proteins, was noted. This was unanticipated, since immunological pressures would have been predicted to result in positive selection of Env or Gag residues thought to be important for neutralization of CTL epitopes, and suggests that intracellular lentiviral replication restriction exerts greater selection pressure than host immune surveillance in the establishment of lentiviral infection in a new host species (313).", "citance": "This deamination results in catastrophic G-to-A mutations in the viral genome, determining inactivation (157, 215, 237, 411) and/or degradation (348) of the viral genome.", "claims": [{"text": "Deamination of cytidine to uridine on the minus strand of viral DNA results in catastrophic G-to-A mutations in the viral genome.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "The deamination of cytidine to uridine on the minus strand of viral DNA can inactivate the viral genome by inducing G-to-A mutations.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

An immensely diverse region, Europe comprises some of the richest countries in the world alongside regions that have undergone dramatic political, social and economic changes during the last decade, a number of which having ended the 1990s with incomes close to those of the least developed countries. The economic disparities show a distinct geographical pattern, with national income per capita falling almost exponentially along the west-east axis. Thus, in Luxembourg in 2001, GDP per capita was, at $53,780 (PPP), about 50 times that in Tajikistan ($1,170) and at least 20 times that in the countries of the Caucasus region, Moldova, Uzbekistan or Kyrgyzstan (UNDP, 2003).", "citation_paragraph": "Research on trends in mortality in the former communist countries of Central Europe found that the decline in mortality from causes considered amenable to timely and effective health care ('avoidable mortality') had been slower there than in the west during the 1970s and 1980s (Boys et al., 1991) . Later work suggested that deaths from these causes accounted for between a quarter and a third of the gap in life expectancy between the East and West of Europe (Velkova et al., 1997) .More recent evidence suggests that some of the more economically successful former communist countries have seen tangible improvements in outcomes attributable to health care, such as improvements in survival of low birth weight babies (Koupilov\u00e1 et al., 1998; Nolte at al., 2000c) and in cancer survival (Becker and Boyle, 1997; Shkolnikov et al., 1999b) , indicating that these countries have been able to reform their healthcare systems relatively successfully. In contrast, other countries, while their basic infrastructure has remained in place, saw some elements of their system effectively collapsing. In particular, there have been major problems with pharmaceutical supplies. This is further illustrated by recent studies which aimed to assess the potential impact of health care on changing mortality in Russia, Lithuania, Hungary and Romania (Andreev et al., 2003; Nolte et al., 2004) . Again, using the concept of avoidable mortality, these showed that in Russia in 1995-1999 life expectancy at birth could have been improved by at least 1.5 years if outcomes of health care as seen in the United Kingdom were achieved (Andreev et al., 2003) . Also, a drop in life expectancy in Romania in the early 1990s was caused, to a considerable extent, by rising mortality from causes that are amenable to effective health care (Nolte et al., 2004) .It is likely that the increase in mortality among the elderly in some FSU countries is a consequence of a reduction in the quality of health care, especially as the increase has been greatest, and more sustained, in countries such as Belarus where the economic situation is worst. However the main evidence is from deaths among young people with diabetes. This population is especially susceptible to a breakdown in the delivery of health care as, in the absence of a regular supply of insulin, they will simply die. Deaths from diabetes at ages under 50 increased about eight-fold in the 1990s in many former Soviet countries (Telishevska et al., 2001) . Similarly, to maintain the health of pregnant women and infants, access to medical advice and care is a critical factor. However, while in many FSU countries these services are, in theory, available, they appear to be largely ineffective and/or of low quality, with many facilitiesfor example in Armenia -lacking even basic infrastructure and equipment, such as water supply, toilets and refrigerators .Taken together these findings emphasise the need for governments in many countries, especially in the FSU, together with the international donor community, to explore how they can establish a health care system that provides effective and equitable care for their populations, which their present systems clearly do not.", "citance": "Research on trends in mortality in the former communist countries of Central Europe found that the decline in mortality from causes considered amenable to timely and effective health care ('avoidable mortality') had been slower there than in the west during the 1970s and 1980s (Boys et al., 1991) .", "claims": [{"text": "Decline of mortality from causes considered amenable to timely and effective health in the 1970s and 1980s was faster in countries of Central Europe than in the west.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Decline of mortality from causes considered amenable to timely and effective health in the 1970s and 1980s was slower in countries of Central Europe than in the west.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 145821873, "title": "Fibroblasts as Modulators of Local and Systemic Cancer Metabolism", "abstract": "Fibroblast activation is an accompanying feature of solid tumor progression, resembling a conserved host response to tissue damage. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) comprise a heterogeneous and plastic population with increasingly appreciated roles in tumor growth, metastatic capacity, and response to therapy. Classical features of fibroblasts in a wound-healing response, including profound extracellular matrix production and cytokine release, are recapitulated in cancer. Emerging evidence suggests that fibroblastic cells in the microenvironments of solid tumors also critically modulate cellular metabolism in the neoplastic compartment through mechanisms including paracrine transfer of metabolites or non-cell-autonomous regulation of metabolic signaling pathways. These metabolic functions may represent common mechanisms by which fibroblasts stimulate growth of the regenerating epithelium during a wound-healing reaction, or may reflect unique co-evolution of cancer cells and surrounding stroma within the tumor microenvironment. Here we review the recent literature supporting an important role for CAFs in regulation of cancer cell metabolism, and relevant pathways that may serve as targets for therapeutic intervention.", "citation_paragraph": "Upon activation, quiescent fibroblasts undergo transcriptomic and metabolic programming that mimics the \"Warburg Effect\" metabolic phenotype, which is further exaggerated in the hypoxic TME [1, 31, 32] (Figure 2 ). The hypoxia response is a universally conserved response to insufficient oxygen availability wherein the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) complex is stabilized and transported to hypoxia response element (HRE) promoter sequences to engage in transcription of over 100 genes, many of which are directly involved in increasing anaerobic glycolysis rate [33] . Competition for glucose between CAFs and cancer cells seems counterproductive for tumorigenesis. Instead there are several lines of evidence suggesting metabolic reprogramming to coordinate glucose and lactate metabolism in the TME. Metabolic tracing experiments have shown that well-oxygenated cancer cells support high glycolysis rate of cells in hypoxia by increasing lactate uptake [34, 35] . This is further validated by differential expression of monocarboxylate transporters (MCT) with cells experiencing hypoxia increasing MCT4 levels, lactate efflux, and cells in normoxia increasing MCT1 for lactate import [34, 35] . In the context of tumor metabolism, this phenomenon has been dubbed as the \"Reverse Warburg Effect,\" from the perspective of cancer cells reacting to metabolic reprogramming in CAFs [36] . This observation was first made in genetic analyses of breast cancer CAFs that exhibited low caveolin-1 (CAV1) expression [37] . Upon knockout of CAV1, fibroblasts gained myofibroblastic markers and increased rate of aerobic glycolysis [37] . Further analysis demonstrated that the metabolic program of CAFs in breast cancer is supported by cancer cells' increased lactate uptake to support their own bioenergetic needs [37, 38] . The same metabolic reprogramming has been shown in prostate cancer CAFs upon direct contact with cancer cells in co-culture studies [39] . The \"Warburg Effect\" in CAFs is also exhibited through classic fibroblast activators, TGF-\u03b2 and PDGF, which have been shown to downregulate isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) expression resulting in decreased of cellular levels of \u03b1-ketogluterate (\u03b1-KG), due to impaired isocitrate to \u03b1-KG conversion [40] . \u03b1-KG and oxygen are critical co-factors for PHD enzymes, which negatively regulate stability of glycolysis master regulator HIF1\u03b1 by promoting its ubiquitin-mediated proteosome degradation in normoxia [40, 41] . Moreover, TGF-\u03b2 signaling in CAFs has been shown to trigger increased oxidative stress, autophagy/mitophagy, and aerobic glycolysis-all known factors enhancing HIF1\u03b1 stability [42, 43] . The \"Reverse Warburg Effect\" does not reflect all metabolic crosstalk across fibrotic tumors as evidenced by studies in breast and pancreatic cancer showing CAFs increasing lactate uptake and re-purposing it for bioenergetics [44, 45] . In turn, clearance of lactate by CAFs enhances higher glycolysis rate in cancer cells. It is not clear why well-oxygenated cancer cells will switch to lactate in preference of glucose, but these observations showing the \"Reverse Warburg Effect\" seem to conform with the concept of metabolic symbiosis required for tumor progression wherein CAFs' ability to support cancer cell metabolism through glycolysis byproducts is necessary for tumor formation.Upon malignant transformation, cancer cells become increasingly dependent on an exogenous supply of amino acids, especially glutamine, the most abundant amino acid in plasma [46] . In ovarian cancer, CAFs have been shown to harness carbon and nitrogen from aspartate, asparagine, and lactate to generate glutamine [47] . Thus, through upregulation of anapleurotic glutamine metabolism CAFs are able to support glutamine-addicted cancer cells in the glutamine-starved TME. This relationship was shown by blocking expression of glutamate ammonia ligase, thereby impairing CAF ability to provide glutamine to cancer cells, which hindered tumor growth [47] . A similar effect was achieved by blocking glutamine catabolism through genetic ablation of glutamate synthase. Combining the effects of inhibiting glutamine synthesis in CAFs and glutamine catabolism in cancer cells prevented formation and metastasis of ovarian cancer. In the nutrient-poor PDAC TME, alanine derived from autophagic CAFs is utilized by pancreatic cancer cells as a carbon source to fuel bioenergetic and biosynthetic processes, compensating for low levels of glucose/glutamine in the TME [44] . Moreover, through the provision of alanine, CAFs further enhance carcinogenesis by allowing cancer cells to fuel TCA cycle, support lipid and NEAA synthesis, as well as diverting glucose metabolism to serine and glycine synthesis both of which are essential for cancer cell survival [44, 48] . In contrast to autophagy activation in pancreatic cancer, genetic analyses of prostate and liver tumor stroma shows a decrease of autophagy substrate signaling adaptor protein, p62, resulting in defective autophagy [49, 50] . p62 depletion increases expression of ATF4, targeted for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation in normal fibroblasts with normal expression of p62 [51] . ATF4-positive CAFs support neoplastic cell growth in low glutamine conditions through activation of the pyruvate carboxylase-asparagine synthase pathway [51] . In this instance, CAF-derived asparagine supports cancer cells bioenergetics and nitrogen needs in the glutamine-poor TME. These studies reveal the significance of CAFs as regulators of TME metabolism by providing glutamine and amino acids that serve as intermediates to glutamine metabolic pathways, supporting tumor establishment and metastasis.evidenced One of the challenges in understanding the role of CAFs in carcinogenesis is the fact that fibroblasts are found in most tissues, yet they remain poorly characterized. Interestingly, a well-known feature of particular pancreatic fibroblasts and hepatic fibroblasts, known as pancreatic and hepatic stellate cells, is their ability to store lipids in their quiescent phenotype [52] . Upon activation and during carcinogenesis, stellate cells lose their ability to store lipids, but the relevance of stromal lipid metabolism in cancer remains poorly understood. Interestingly, metabolomic studies of KRAS mutant cells experiencing hypoxia demonstrate inability to undergo de novo lipogenesis and instead show more reliance on lipid scavenging, suggesting a potential metabolic function of lipids secreted by activated fibroblasts [53] . Recently, work from our lab demonstrated that activated stellate cells secrete abundant lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC), the preferred fatty acid scavenging substrate for RAS-transformed cells, which can support PDAC cells growth both via uptake and biomass production and via hydrolysis by the secreted enzyme autotaxin to yield mitogenic lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) [54] . Reprogramming of lipid metabolism has also been demonstrated in prostate CAFs compared to normal prostate fibroblasts [55] . Prostate CAFs have elevated neutral lipid storage, and these lipid stores cooperate with pigment epithelium-derived growth factor to amplify microtubule-organizing centers. Further roles of CAF lipid secretion remain to be elucidated as several lines of evidence suggest that exogenous lipids support auxotrophic cancer cell growth [56, 57] .by studies in breast and pancreatic cancer showing CAFs increasing lactate uptake and repurposing it for bioenergetics [44,45]. In turn, clearance of lactate by CAFs enhances higher glycolysis rate in cancer cells. It is not clear why well-oxygenated cancer cells will switch to lactate in preference of glucose, but these observations showing the \"Reverse Warburg Effect\" seem to conform with the concept of metabolic symbiosis required for tumor progression wherein CAFs' ability to support cancer cell metabolism through glycolysis byproducts is necessary for tumor formation.Another little-explored aspect of CAFs is exosome-mediated metabolic crosstalk. Recent studies have shown that exosomes carry proteins, nucleic acids, miRNAs, and metabolic molecules [58] . CAF-derived exosomes, CDEs, of prostate and pancreatic cancer have been shown to reprogram metabolism of cancer cells by significantly up-regulating glycolysis while down-regulating oxidative metabolism by promoting glutamine decarboxylation and at the same time generating metabolites for de novo lipogenesis [59] . Metabolomic analysis of CDE contents reveal that they carry lactate, acetate, and amino acids-shown to be taken by cancer cells through carbon tracing analyses. Interestingly, CDE metabolic reprogramming was shown to be independent of oncogenic KRAS in pancreatic cancer, thereby demonstrating CAFs' ability to reprogram and support cancer cell metabolism independent of oncogene activation. CDEs have been shown to enhance gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cancer cells by enhancing proliferation and glycolysis [60] . The extent to which CDEs modulate the metabolism of cells in the TME remains to be further explored.The TME is highly dynamic and the accessibility to oxygen and nutrients is never constant forcing cancer cells to reprogram their metabolism accordingly. The studies summarized in this section highlight the role CAFs play in sustaining tumor cell metabolism. Further studies are required to understand the way in which CAFs provide metabolic support to cancer cells in order to identify novel therapeutic avenues.", "citance": "In contrast to autophagy activation in pancreatic cancer, genetic analyses of prostate and liver tumor stroma shows a decrease of autophagy substrate signaling adaptor protein, p62, resulting in defective autophagy [49, 50] .", "claims": [{"text": "Decrease of p62 in prostate tumor stroma results in defective autophagy.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Increase of p62 in prostate tumor stroma results in defective autophagy.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS The aim of the current study was to test possible candidate molecules which might mediate this synergistic interaction in an in vitro model of mixed biofilms, such as farnesol, tyrosol and prostaglandin (PG) E2. In mono-microbial and dual biofilms of C.albicans wild type strains PGE2 levels between 25 and 250 pg/mL were measured. Similar concentrations of purified PGE2 significantly enhanced S.aureus biofilm formation in a mode comparable to that observed in dual species biofilms. Supernatants of the null mutant deficient in PGE2 production did not stimulate the proliferation of S.aureus and the addition of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin blocked the S.aureus biofilm formation in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, S. aureus biofilm formation was boosted by low and inhibited by high farnesol concentrations. Supernatants of the farnesol-deficient C. albicans ATCC10231 strain significantly enhanced the biofilm formation of S. aureus but at a lower level than the farnesol producer SC5314. However, C. albicans ATCC10231 also produced PGE2 but amounts were significantly lower compared to SC5314.   CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE In conclision, we identified C. albicans PGE2 as a key molecule stimulating the growth and biofilm formation of S. aureus in dual S. aureus/C. albicans biofilms, although C. albicans derived farnesol, but not tyrosol, may also contribute to this effect but to a lesser extent.", "citation_paragraph": "In polymicrobial infections, biofilm formation is the predominant mode of life [29] [30] [31] . Biofilms are structured microbial communities attached to biotic or abiotic surfaces and embedded in a matrix of exopolymers to withstand the host immune response and exhibit increased resistance to antimicrobial agents [32] [33] [34] [35] . It is estimated that 27% of nosocomial C. albicans bloodstream infections are polymicrobial, with S. aureus as the third most common organism isolated in conjunction with C. albicans [36] .In vitro studies demonstrated that the formation of S. aureus biofilms on abiotic materials in the presence of serum requires pre-coating and nutrient supplementation [37] . In order to study the interactions between C. albicans and S. aureus in mono-microbial and dual species biofilms, we have optimized an in vitro biofilm model of infection. Using this model, we observed increased growth rates of S. aureus in dual biofilms in the presence of C. albicans. In vitro studies described the formation of S. aureus microcolonies on the surface of biofilms with C. albicans serving as the underlying scaffolding [38, 39] . The adherence of S. aureus on fungal hyphae was mediated by the Candida agglutinin-like protein 3 (Als3p; [40] ). Studies of the protein expression during the growth of dual C. albicans/S. aureus biofilms identified 27 differentially regulated proteins, mostly involved in growth, metabolism, or stress response. Among the down-regulated staphylococcal proteins was the global transcriptional repressor of virulence factors, CodY, suggesting that the enhanced pathogenesis of S. aureus may not only be due to physical interactions [41, 42] .Staib et al. [1] hypothesized the potential existence of C. albicans end-products as a substratum for a favorable growth of S. aureus. One of the C. albicans products continuously excreted in the environment is farnesol a quorum sensing molecule involved in the regulation of the fungal yeast-mycelium dimorphism. At high levels, farnesol has been shown to exhibit antimicrobial activity against various pathogens [12] . Kaneko et al. reported growth inhibition of S. aureus at concentrations of 40 \u03bcg mL -1 (equivalent to 180 \u03bcM) which is concordant with our results [43] . In this study, subinhibitory concentrations of farnesol (0.5-5 nM) promoted the biofilm formation of S. aureus, an effect already described for several antimicrobial agents [44] [45] [46] [47] . In stationary phase cultures of C. albicans, farnesol accumulated at levels between 2 and 4 \u03bcM [8, 48] . In addition, our data showed that S. aureus biofilm production was propagated by the farnesol-deficient C. albicans strain ATCC 10231 albeit at a lower level compared to the farnesol producer C. albicans SC5314, whereas the PGE 2 null mutant did not enhanced the growth of S. aureus. Unlike SC5314, ATCC10231 excreted significantly lower levels of PGE 2 in this experimental setting indicating that the differences in the growth-stimulating effect to S. aureus resulted from the PGE 2 levels. In conclusion, it appears that PGE 2 has a superior role in the induction of S. aureus biofilm formation as compared to farnesol, which, however, also supports the growth of S. aureus at low concentrations. We demonstrated for the first time that C.albicans PGE 2 may be one of the suggested endproducts presumed by Staib [1] . As shown in this study, the stimulatory effect to the growth of S. aureus was not observed, when C. albicans supernatants or medium supplemented with purified PGE 2 were heat treated suggesting that PGE 2 is heat-sensitive. This observation is concordant with the results described by Carlson who reported increased mortality rates of mice co-infected with sublethal doses of C. albicans and S. aureus [3] . This effect could not be reproduced when either of the agents was heat inactivated.Endogenous PGE 2 maintains the integrity of the mucosal barrier in the lungs and in the gastrointestinal tract [49] [50] [51] . Mucus accumulation and overexpression of inflammatory response genes are relevant pathogenic features of cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene cftr [52] . Recently, Harmon et al. demonstrated a defective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARy) function in epithelial cells which was caused by the decreased conversion of PGE 2 to the PPARy ligand 15-keto-PGE 2 leading to the accumulation of PGE 2 [51] . As elevated levels of PGE 2 have been detected in respiratory tract samples of patients suffering from cystic fibrosis [53, 54] and in consideration of the results from this study, it seems to be possible that enhanced PGE 2 levels may contribute to the early airway colonization due to S. aureus in patients with CF. PGE 2 was demonstrated to induce germ tube formation and to be involved in biofilm formation by C. albicans [55, 56] suggesting C. albicans PGE 2 to be a potential virulence factor. Despite induced endocytosis by host cells at the early stage of infection, hyphal mediated active penetration of the host tissue is the major route of invasion [57, 58] . Tissue invasion by C.albicans is associated with cytokine secretion, inducing host immune response mechanisms. Phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils represents the first line of defense against Candida infections but intracellular killing is not always effective. One of the underlying mechanisms is the inhibition of the phagosome maturation and the nitric oxid (NO) production in macrophages after infection with C. albicans [59] , an effect that may be resulted from candidal PGE 2 excretion. PGE 2 is a critical molecule that regulates the activation, maturation, migration, and cytokine secretion of several immune cells, particular those of the innate immunity. In the context of infection, endogenous PGE 2 inhibits the cytolytic effector function of natural killer (NK) cells, the activation, migration and production of proteolytic enzymes in granulocytes and limits the phagocytosis and pathogen-killing function of alveolar macrophages (reviewed by [14, 18] . Aronoff et al. reported the negative regulatory role of endogenously produced and exogenously added PGE 2 on FcRy-mediated phagocytosis of bacterial pathogens by alveolar macrophages suggesting that PGE 2 derived from C. albicans may impair the local host innate immunity [60] . This suggestion is underlined by the investigations of Roux et al. who had shown that airway colonization with C. albicans inhibited phagocytosis of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa and enhanced the prevalence of bacterial pneumonia, which was reduced by antifungal treatment [61, 62] .Mice inoculated with either S. aureus or C. albicans survived infection, whereas combined infection with both pathogens enhanced the mortality rate to 40-100% [3, 4] . Reversely, enhanced microbial clearance and survival was demonstrated in studies with COX-2-deficient mice [63] [64] [65] . This is in line with our observation that a mutant strain of C. albicans deficient in PGE 2 production did not promote the growth of S. aureus. Furthermore, in this study the non-selective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor indomethacin that blocked PGE 2 biosynthesis by C. albicans also reduced the growth of S. aureus in dual biofilms to a level observed in mono-microbial S. aureus biofilms.Thus, treatment with indomethacin or with antifungal agents may exhibit several positive effects in patients with dual S. aureus/C. albicans infections [51, [60] [61] [62] .Finally, in this study S. aureus did not enhanced the biofilm thickness of C. albicans and its PGE 2 synthesis in dual biofilms compared with mono-microbial C. albicans biofilms, although bacterial peptidoglycan-derived molecules have been shown to promote C. albicans hyphal growth [66, 67] . Thus, in mixed biofilms the impact of S. aureus to C. albicans remained unclear.", "citance": "Recently, Harmon et al. demonstrated a defective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARy) function in epithelial cells which was caused by the decreased conversion of PGE 2 to the PPARy ligand 15-keto-PGE 2 leading to the accumulation of PGE 2 [51] .", "claims": [{"text": "Decreased conversion of PGE 2 to PPARy ligand 15-ket-PGE 2 causes accumulation of PGE.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Defects in epithelial cells' peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARy) are caused by decreased conversion of PGE 2 to PPARy ligand 15-ket-PGE 2.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Increased conversion of PGE 2 to PPARy ligand 15-ket-PGE 2 causes accumulation of PGE.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}

Drugs acting on the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), showed similar benefit on major CV events to other antihypertensive medications. In real-world practice, ARBs reduced by 10% the incidence of CV mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke and provided superior protection against CV events than ACEIs in high-risk patients. Despite similar antihypertensive properties and a favourable safety profile for both ACEIs and ARBs, evidence indicates that patients treated with ARBs have lower rates of withdrawal for adverse events and greater persistence to therapy than those treated with ACEIs. Among ARBs, olmesartan is one of the latest generation compounds introduced in clinical practice for treating hypertension: head-to-head comparative trials suggest that the efficacy of olmesartan is superior to that of commonly prescribed ACEIs (ramipril and perindopril). The drug, administered as a monotherapy or in combination with a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker or a thiazide diuretic, has proved to be effective in maintaining blood pressure stability over 24 h, with a favourable safety profile and low discontinuation rates.

Raised levels of blood pressure (BP), body mass index, blood glucose and cholesterol are responsible for more than 60% of global deaths from cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease and diabetes, with hypertension having a major impact [2] . The rise in systolic blood pressure (SBP) has a greater effect on angina, myocardial infarction and peripheral artery disease, whereas increased diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is mainly associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm [3] . Hypertension is also the main cause of stroke, congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation [4] .The benefits of treatments aimed to lower BP for CVD prevention are well established. A 10-mmHg decrease in SBP reduces the risk of major CVD events by 20%, coronary heart disease by 17%, stroke by 27%, heart failure by 28% and all-cause mortality by 13% [5] , while a decrease in DBP has been linearly related to a lower risk of recurrent stroke (p = 0.026) and allcause mortality (p = 0.009) [6] .The effects of BP lowering are broadly similar even in the presence of concomitant comorbidities or previous CVDs, coronary heart disease or cerebrovascular disease [5] . These findings highlight the importance of a tight and persistent BP control, which is increasingly being considered as the most essential therapeutic strategy for effective secondary CVD prevention [6] .Controlling and lowering BP is per se functional to reduce CV risk, independently of the antihypertensive approaches used [7] and produces a significant outcome improvement in all hypertension grades, in patients at high risk for the presence of diabetes mellitus and in those with a history of previous CV events [8] [9] [10] .Treatments aimed at lowering BP may be important in reducing CVD risk even in individuals with normal or high normal BP [11] .All classes of antihypertensive drugs have been shown to significantly reduce the risk of stroke and major CV events: however, some classes of drugs such as those acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) have proved to be particularly favourable in terms of efficacy and safety and for this reason are among the most popular, widely used and recommended antihypertensive medications [4] .

We measured circadian period (\u01ae) and rhythmicity index in the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) and observed extensive genetic variation in both. Seven DGRP lines had sexually dimorphic arrhythmicity and one line had an exceptionally long \u01ae. Genome-wide analyses identified 584 polymorphisms in 268 genes. We observed differences among transcripts for nine genes predicted to interact among themselves and canonical clock genes in the long period line and a control. Mutations/RNAi knockdown targeting these genes also affected circadian behavior. Our observations reveal that complex genetic interactions influence high levels of variation in circadian phenotypes.", "citation_paragraph": "disease (Reutrakul and Knutson 2015; McHill and Wright 2017; Reutrakul and Van Cauter 2014) . Profound effects on metabolic processes such as glucose tolerance, body mass index (BMI) and cortisol levels result from the disruption of sleep and circadian cycles combined with poor dietary choices (Shi and Zheng 2013; McHill et al. 2014) . Thus, disrupted circadian rhythms are an important consideration in the etiology of disease.The circadian period in humans is tightly regulated and close to 24 h (Czeisler et al. 1999) . Human clocks have a built-in mechanism to adjust endogenous period and phase in response to a moderate light stimulus (Scheer et al. 2007 ). Human studies focus on chronotype, which is the preference for morning or evening activity (Kalmbach et al. 2016) . Chronotype has been shown to have a genetic component (Jones et al. 2016; Lane et al. 2016; Kalmbach et al. 2016; Toomey et al. 2015) . Candidate gene studies show associations between core canonical clock genes and chronotype (Kalmbach et al. 2016) . For instance, a hereditary form of delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD) is associated with a dominant coding variation in the core circadian clock gene CRY1 (Patke et al. 2017) . Recently, three large-scale genome-wide association studies in humans revealed that, in addition to canonical clock genes, novel genes may contribute to differences in human chronotype (Jones et al. 2016; Lane et al. 2016; Hu et al. 2016) .Core clock mechanisms regulating circadian behavior are remarkably similar between mammals and Drosophila melanogaster, even though they diverged approximately 600 million years ago (Yu and Hardin 2006; Panda et al. 2002; Nitta et al. 2015) . In fact, the genes and processes involved in complex mammalian circadian rhythms were first identified in flies (Konopka and Benzer 1971; Hardin et al. 1990 ). Rhythmic rest and activity behavior in Drosophila is one of the most reliable phenotypes for the identification of novel genes regulating circadian rhythms (Hardin 2011; HelfrichForster et al. 2011) . The use of flies for rest and activity studies offers several advantages over mammalian models. For example, the availability of an extensive collection of stocks with mapped mutations, chromosomal deletions, and transgenic constructs have facilitated forward genetics approaches in circadian rhythm studies. This approach has identified numerous genes of the circadian clock (Hardin et al. 1990; Takahashi 1993; Reppert and Weaver 2002; Sehgal et al. 1995; Dunlap et al. 2007) .Variability in circadian period and rhythmicity parameters among wild-derived isochromosomal lines of flies has previously been noted (Emery et al. 1994 (Emery et al. , 1995 , and this variation has a genetic component (Emery et al. 1995) . Heritability has been estimated at 0.14 for circadian period (Emery et al. 1995) . Therefore, naturally occurring polymorphisms likely influence the fly's circadian clock. Historically, most work has focused on polymorphic variation within the canonical clock genes in natural populations. Studies of a threonine-glycine-encoding repeat region in the period gene revealed a clinal distribution of these alleles in natural populations in Europe and Australia (Kyriacou et al. 2008; Sawyer et al. 1997) . Likewise, an insertion in the 5\u2032 coding region of timeless varies with latitude in European flies (Kyriacou et al. 2008 ). Furthermore, a polymorphic variant in the genomic region containing shaggy is clinal in North America, though not in Australia (Rand et al. 2010) . In contrast, a non-synonymous polymorphism in cryptochrome does not vary with latitude but persists in nearly equal frequencies in European populations (Pegoraro et al. 2014) . These polymorphisms are associated with differences in temperature-compensated period length (Kyriacou et al. 2008; Sawyer et al. 1997) , the frequency of diapause (Kyriacou et al. 2008; Tauber et al. 2007 ), the timing of eclosion (Pegoraro et al. 2014) , and thermal tolerance (Rand et al. 2010; Sawyer et al. 1997 ). These experiments demonstrate the importance of polymorphic variation in canonical clock genes to circadian behavior in flies; however, the contribution of polymorphic variants in the rest of the genome to circadian behavior in natural populations remains largely unexplored.Recently, several efforts have been made to study genomic differences for a variety of behaviors, diseases and life history traits using genetic reference populations of Drosophila (King et al. 2012a, b; Mackay et al. 2012; Huang et al. 2014; Grenier et al. 2015) . Here, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using the D. melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP), a unique resource created by mating full siblings of wild-caught isofemale lines for 20 generations (Mackay et al. 2012; Huang et al. 2014) , to explore the range of polymorphic variants contributing to genetic variation in Drosophila circadian phenotypes. Some of the salient features of the DGRP collection are (i) availability of full sequence data, (ii) rapid decay in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with physical distance, (iii) and a lack of population structure (Mackay et al. 2012; Huang et al. 2014) . Another important feature of the DGRP is the ability to perform screening of identical genotypes in a controlled environment, thus elucidating the role of genes in micro-environmental plasticity (Morgante et al. 2015; Lin et al. 2016a ). Many studies ranging from natural variation in physiological processes (food intake and nutrient stores) (Garlapow et al. 2015; Unkless et al. 2015) , to variation in behavior (olfactory avoidance and aggression) (Arya et al. 2015; Shorter et al. 2015) , to anatomical features (mushroom body size and abdominal pigmentation) (Dembeck et al. 2015; Zwarts et al. 2015) , and to environmental and drug responses (radiation resistance and paraquat) (Vaisnav et al. 2014; Weber et al. 2012) have exploited the DGRP.In this study, we examined two circadian phenotypes, circadian period (\u01ae) and rhythmicity index (RI), a measure 1 3 of how consistent the fly's daily activity patterns are, in 167 DGRP lines. We observed high levels of sex-specific genetic variation for both \u01ae and RI. Several lines had sex-specific arrhythmic behavior and one line (DGRP_892) had a very long average circadian period of 31 h. The GWAS identified 584 molecular polymorphisms in 268 candidate genes associated with \u01ae and RI. Thus, the association mapping strategy enabled us to identify candidate genes affecting variation in circadian behavior.", "citance": "For instance, a hereditary form of delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD) is associated with a dominant coding variation in the core circadian clock gene CRY1 (Patke et al. 2017) .", "claims": [{"text": "Delayed sleep phase disorder is associated with a dominant coding variation the core circadian clock gene CRY1.

Typhi-Specific CD8+ T Cells in Volunteers following Ty21a Typhoid Immunization", "abstract": "Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi), the causative agent of typhoid fever, continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality world-wide. CD8+ T cells are an important component of the cell mediated immune (CMI) response against S. Typhi. Recently, interleukin (IL)-17A has been shown to contribute to mucosal immunity and protection against intracellular pathogens. To investigate multifunctional IL-17A responses against S. Typhi antigens in T memory subsets, we developed multiparametric flow cytometry methods to detect up to 6 cytokines/chemokines (IL-10, IL-17A, IL-2, interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03b2 (MIP-1\u03b2)) simultaneously. Five volunteers were immunized with a 4 dose regimen of live-attenuated S. Typhi vaccine (Ty21a), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated before and at 11 time points after immunization, and CMI responses were evaluated. Of the 5 immunized volunteers studied, 3 produced detectable CD8+ T cell responses following stimulation with S. Typhi-infected autologous B lymphoblastoid cell lines (B-LCL). Additionally, 2 volunteers had detectable levels of intracellular cytokines in response to stimulation with S. Typhi-infected HLA-E restricted cells. Although the kinetics of the responses differed among volunteers, all of the responses were bi- or tri-phasic and included multifunctional CD8+ T cells. Virtually all of the IL-17A detected was derived from multifunctional CD8+ T cells. The presence of these multifunctional IL-17A+ CD8+ T cells was confirmed using an unsupervised analysis program, flow cytometry clustering without K (FLOCK). This is the first report of IL-17A production in response to S. Typhi in humans, indicating the presence of a Tc17 response which may be important in protection. The presence of IL-17A in multifunctional cells co-producing Tc1 cytokines (IL-2, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1) may also indicate that the distinction between Tc17 and Tc1 responses in humans is not as clearly delineated as suggested by in vitro experiments and animal models.", "citation_paragraph": "Here we demonstrate the presence and persistence of multifunctional IL-17A producing S. Typhi-specific CD8+ T cells in response to both S. Typhi-infected autologous B-LCL and HLA-E restricted stimulation. Multifunctional IL-17A+ cells demonstrated multiphasic kinetics and were still detectable one year after immunization. We identified quadruple and quintuple positive CD8+ T EM and T EMRA IL-17A producing cells that co-produce pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines IL-2, IFN-c, TNF-a, and/or MIP-1b but not IL-10. These multifunctional populations were confirmed using unsupervised flow cytometric analysis with FLOCK.IL-17 has been increasingly implicated in host responses against intracellular pathogens [19] . Specifically, the importance of IL-17 in mucosal immune responses to intracellular enteric pathogens has been demonstrated in animal models [20, 21] . It was shown that depletion of Th17 cells during simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection results in increased dissemination of Salmonella Typhimurium from the gut [20] . Additionally, antigen-specific IL-17A+ cells were identified in response to Salmonella Enteriditis infection and IL-17A knockout mice had an elevated bacterial burden in the liver and spleen as compared to wild-type mice [37] . Thus, it was of great importance to initiate studies to evaluate whether IL-17A might play a role in protection from S. Typhi. Because the gastrointestinal mucosa is the first point of contact for S. Typhi, mucosal immune responses are likely to play an important role in protection. This is to our knowledge, the first report of IL-17A production in response to S. Typhi, both to S. Typhi-infected autologous targets, as well as HLA-E restricted stimulation. The presence of S. Typhi-specific CD8+ T cells producing IL-17A suggests that these cells may play a role in the mucosal response. CD8+ T cells with characteristics of the Th17 lineage, Tc17, have been described in the setting of chronic hepatitis C virus infection [25] ; however, in these studies, stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and ionomycin was used rather than specific antigen. Thus, the results presented in this manuscript are, to our knowledge, the first demonstration in humans of the presence of CD8 + Tc17 cells responsive to antigens from infectious agents.Multifunctional T cells, i.e., those producing 2 or more cytokines simultaneously, have been shown to produce higher levels of individual cytokines, have enhanced function, and are more likely to correlate with protection from disease, when compared to single cytokine producing cells [29, 30, 31] . Although T cells co-producing IL-17A with IFN-c or TNF-a in response to PMA/ionomycin stimulation have been identified [38, 39] , to our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the simultaneous production of IL-17A with 5 other cytokines/chemokines, which play key roles in inflammatory processes, in a human-pathogen specific system. Of note, unsupervised flow cytometric FLOCK analysis showed higher levels of IFN-c and TNF-a being produced by IL-17A-producing multifunctional cells (i.e., multifunctional IL-17A+ populations are bright for IFN-c and TNF-a). In addition, we observed that IL-17A was produced exclusively by multifunctional cells and that the predominant IL-17A+ responses were IL-17A+ IL-2+ IFN-c+ TNF-a+ MIP-1b+/2 as assessed by both supervised (FCOM) and unsupervised (FLOCK) flow cytometric analyses. The co-production of IL-17A with cytokines typically associated with Tc1 responses, suggest that the Tc17 lineage is not as distinct in humans as in vitro and animal studies have previously suggested.Multiphasic kinetics have previously been demonstrated in response to Ty21a immunization following stimulation in an HLA-E restricted manner [13] . Here we confirm and extend these findings by showing that multiphasic kinetics are also typical of responses to autologous stimulation with B-LCL. Interestingly, despite their bi-or tri-phasic nature, the kinetics of responses to autologous stimulation and HLA-E restricted stimulation differed. HLA-E is a non-classical major histocompatibility (MHC) molecule which is highly conserved [40] and it is expressed ubiquitously on PBMC (at various levels depending on the individual cell types) in combination with classical MHC molecules [41] . Given the differences in kinetics between autologous and HLA-E restricted stimulation, as well as the fact that volunteer 50 s showed responses to autologous stimulation but not to HLA-E restricted stimulation, our results clearly indicate that while HLA-E restricted responses may contribute to the responses seen when PBMC were stimulated with S. Typhiinfected autologous B-LCL, they represent only a portion of these responses. It will be important to confirm these findings using different targets such as autologous blasts. However, these data are supported by the fact that in previous studies, monoclonal antibodies against HLA-E were only able to partially block CTL activity against S. Typhi-infected targets, while monoclonal antibody against a pan-MHC class I marker (W6/32) showed almost complete abrogation of CTL against S. Typhi-infected targets [9] . Moreover, the observations that at different times after immunization there are considerable differences in the effector subsets that respond to autologous and HLA-E restricted S. Typhiinfected cells raises the likely possibility that various effector cells might contribute differently to the host defense at various times after exposure. These observations also point to the importance of the timing of specimen collection following immunization and its impact on the magnitude of effector immune responses which can be measured. Finally, it is important to mention that these data confirm and extend previous observations on the longevity of CMI responses (at least 1 year) elicited following immunization with Ty21a and other attenuated typhoid vaccine candidates [12, 13] .The significance of the multiphasic responses observed is not entirely clear; however, it is possible that the decline in the levels of cytokine producing S. Typhi-specific CD8+ T cells at various times could represent these cells homing cells to the gut. Previous studies have, in fact, shown expression of gut-homing molecules on S. Typhi-specific CD8+ T cells [12, 17] . While these multiphasic responses have previously been described for HLA-E restricted responses [13] , this is the first report of multiphasic kinetics in response to autologous stimulation over the course of 1 year postimmunization with the Ty21a typhoid vaccine. As has previously been shown, the responses following HLA-E restricted stimulation peaked as early as 4-7 days post immunization which is earlier than typically expected for CMI responses [13] . Interestingly, in 2 of the 3 responding volunteers (50 s and 53 s), a peak as early as days 4-7 post immunization was observed in response to autologous stimulation as well. In summary, multifunctional IL-17A+ CD8+ T cells display multiphasic kinetics in response to both classical and non-classical MHC restricted stimulation. These responses persist at least 1 year after immunization. Future studies in which the presence of these multifunctional Tc17 responses are evaluated in the context of clinical outcome following challenge of volunteers with wild-type S. Typhi will provide key information to assess the role of multifunctional cells producing high levels of IL-17A and other cytokines in protection from infection. These studies are likely to contribute to accelerate the development of much needed novel typhoid vaccines. Figure S1 Gating strategy used for flow cytometry analyses.

Research Design and Methods Data came from round 1 to 5 of the National Health and Aging Trends Study. Study sample consisted of 3,400 Medicare beneficiaries needing assistance with activities of daily living (ADL), instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), or mobility for any two consecutive years between 2011 and 2015. Study outcome was the number of self-reported adverse consequences of unmet needs for assistance with daily activities (e.g., went without eating, wet or soiled clothes). Mixed-effects negative binomial regression was used to estimate the association of lagged depressive symptoms and covariates in period t-1 and the number of adverse consequences of unmet needs in period t.   Results The prevalence rates of adverse consequences of unmet needs were twice as high among older adults with elevated depressive symptoms as those without depression. After adjusting for covariates, prior wave depressive symptoms were associated with 1.24 times the rate of adverse consequences of unmet needs for assistance with ADL (Incidence Rate Ratio [IRR] = 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09-1.41, p < .01) and IADL (IRR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.06-1.44, p < .01), and 1.14 times the rate of adverse consequences of unmet needs for assistance with mobility (IRR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.03-1.27, p < .05).   Discussion and Implications Caring for older adults with mental health and long-term care needs calls for an integrated social and health services system.", "citation_paragraph": "Allen et al (2014) constructed a conceptual framework on the pathway to unmet need and its adverse consequences, which was the basis of the framework of this study. Severity of illness and impairment determines the level of needs for assistance. Whether needs for assistance will cause adverse consequences depends on the adequacy of informal and formal long-term services and supports (LTSS). In the case of individuals with depression, level of needs for assistance is higher than those without depression due to the increased severity of illness and impairment associated with depression. Depressive symptoms can cause neural, hormonal, and immunological alterations and worsen physical health and functioning (Penninx et al., 1998) . Studies have consistently showed that depression increases the risk of physical disability (Ormel, Rijsdijk, Sullivan, van Sonderen, & Kempen, 2002; Schillerstrom, Royall, & Palmer, 2008) . Depression may also increase the risk of adverse consequences by limiting informal and formal LTSS access. The interpersonal theory of depression posits that the behaviors of individuals with depression such as negative self-statements, passivity, and social withdrawal can erode social support (Hames, Hagan, & Joiner, 2013) , limiting the availability and intensity of informal LTSS from family, friends, and neighbors. The socioeconomic disadvantages associated with depression and other mental illness (Muntaner, Eaton, Miech, & O'Campo, 2004 ) reduce access to formal LTSS by diminishing the ability to purchase long-term care insurance and services.The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of depressive symptoms on adverse consequences of unmet needs for assistance with activities of daily living (ADL), instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), and mobility. The primary study hypothesis is that elevated depressive symptoms at prior wave (i.e., period t\u22121) are associated with more adverse consequences of unmet needs at current wave (i.e., period t). Figure 1 shows the 1-year lagged effect of depressive symptoms on adverse consequences of unmet needs.

{"s2orc_id": 3786505, "title": "New concepts for an old problem: the diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia", "abstract": "BACKGROUND Endometrial hyperplasia (EH) is a uterine pathology representing a spectrum of morphological endometrial alterations. It is predominantly characterized by an increase in the endometrial gland-to-stroma ratio when compared to normal proliferative endometrium. The clinical significance of EH lies in the associated risk of progression to endometrioid endometrial cancer (EC) and 'atypical' forms of EH are regarded as premalignant lesions. Traditional histopathological classification systems for EH exhibit wide and varying degrees of diagnostic reproducibility and, as a consequence, standardized patient management can be challenging.   OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE EC is the most common gynaecological malignancy in developed countries. The incidence of EC is rising, with alarming increases described in the 40-44-year-old age group. This review appraises the current EH classification systems used to stratify women at risk of malignant progression to EC. In addition, we summarize the evidence base regarding the use of immunohistochemical biomarkers for EH and discuss an emerging role for genomic analysis.   SEARCH METHODS PubMed, Medline and the Cochrane Database were searched for original peer-reviewed primary and review articles, from January 2000 to January 2016. The following search terms were used: 'endometrial hyperplasia', 'endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia', 'atypical hyperplasia', 'complex atypical hyperplasia', 'biomarker', 'immunohistochemistry', 'progression', 'genomic', 'classification' and 'stratification'.   OUTCOMES Recent changes to EH classification reflect our current understanding of the genesis of endometrioid ECs. The concept of endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN) as a mutationally activated, monoclonal pre-malignancy represents a fundamental shift from the previously held notion that unopposed oestrogenic stimulation causes ever-increasing hyperplastic proliferation, with accumulating cytological atypia that imperceptibly leads to the development of endometrioid EC. Our review highlights several key biomarker candidates that have been described as both diagnostic tools for EH and markers of progression to EC. We propose that, moving forwards, a 'panel' approach of combinations of the immunohistochemical biomarkers described in this review may be more informative since no single candidate can currently fill the entire role.   WIDER IMPLICATIONS EC has historically been considered a predominantly postmenopausal disease. Owing in part to the current unprecedented rates of obesity, we are starting to see signs of a shift towards a rising incidence of EC amongst pre- and peri-menopausal woman. This creates unique challenges both diagnostically and therapeutically. Furthering our understanding of the premalignant stages of EC development will allow us to pursue earlier diagnosis and facilitate appropriate stratification of women at risk of developing EC, permitting timely and appropriate therapeutic interventions.", "citation_paragraph": "Heart and neural crest derivatives expressed transcript 2 (HAND2) belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors; it plays crucial roles during embryological cardiac morphogenesis (VanDusen et al., 2014) and knockout mice are infertile due to failure of implantation (Li et al., 2011) .

{"s2orc_id": 53712112, "title": "Dexamethasone Reduces the Incidence of Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting in Children Undergoing Endoscopic Adenoidectomy under General Anesthesia Without Increasing the Risk of Postoperative Hemorrhage", "abstract": "BACKGROUND Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a common complication of pediatric anesthesia, but the overall incidence of PONV in patients undergoing adenoidectomy is unknown. The aim of this controlled study was to compare the effect of dexamethasone administration with placebo to reduce PONV in children undergoing endoscopic adenoidectomy under general anesthesia. MATERIAL AND METHODS A randomized placebo-controlled study included 118 pediatric patients who underwent elective endoscopic adenoidectomy under general anesthesia. A dexamethasone-treated (0.15 mg/kg) group (Group D) (n=56) and a placebo group (Group C) (n=62) were randomly assigned. The incidence of nausea and vomiting was recorded on the day of surgery. Postoperative nausea was assessed according to illustrated Baxter Animated Retching Faces (BARF) scale. The Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability (FLACC) scale (scores between 0-10) was used to assess pain. Follow-up was performed on the 14th postoperative day by a telephone call. RESULTS Overall prevalence of postoperative nausea was 25% (30/118) and postoperative vomiting was 14% (17/118). In the first 24 hours following surgery, in Group D, the incidence of nausea and vomiting was 13% and 7%, respectively; in Group C, without pharmacological prophylaxis, the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting was 37%, and 21%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS A prospective controlled study in children undergoing endoscopic adenoidectomy under general anesthesia showed that dexamethasone (0.15 mg/kg) significantly reduced the incidence of PONV without increasing the risk of postoperative hemorrhage. Dexamethasone is a safe method for the prevention of PONV that may be recommended in pediatric anesthesiology.", "citation_paragraph": "in the incidence of vomiting at the inpatient ward (two hours after surgery). Early PONV that occurs in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) (within 2 hours after surgery) was similar in both groups. The observed result is in accordance with the presumed late onset of effect of corticosteroids, which has been shown in a number of previously published studies. Therefore, it is logical to administer dexamethasone at the beginning of the surgical procedure, in order to ensure the onset of effect as early possible after the child recovers from general anesthesia [22] .It is very difficult to evaluate postoperative nausea in patients undergoing adenoidectomy, as this surgical procedure is performed mostly in pre-school children. It is also very difficult to estimate the true incidence of nausea in children who are too young to be able to express their degree of discomfort associated with this subjective feeling. These factors explain why antiemetic studies in children have evaluated postoperative vomiting rather than PONV [6] . However, as the present study showed, the problem of communicating symptoms of nausea by very young children can be solved with the use of the illustrated Baxter Animated Retching Faces (BARF) scale, which helps children to express their feelings of nausea using pictograms. Most pediatric patients with postoperative vomiting also feel postoperative nausea. However, it is possible to assume that a number of children suffer only from postoperative nausea without vomiting. In this study, dexamethasone effectively reduced the incidence of postoperative nausea, which was also reflected by the late BARF score obtained eight hours after surgery. However,, the early BARF score obtained in the PACU did not differ between the interventional and control groups. The decrease in postoperative nausea occurred, similarly to the decrease in postoperative vomiting, only two and more hours after surgery.The safety of the use of dexamethasone in pediatric patients has also been discussed in the literature. The most serious complication following tonsillectomy is hemorrhage, which may be life-threatening. The study by Czarnetzki et al. to investigate the effect of dexamethasone in children undergoing tonsillectomy was prematurely terminated due to the increased risk of postoperative bleeding observed in the group of patients who were treated with dexamethasone to prevent PONV [27] . However, other authors have questioned the study methodology and the findings and three recent meta-analyses did not find any statistically significant increase in the risk of post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage associated with the use of dexamethasone [35] [36] [37] . Another systematic review evaluating the effect of dexamethasone on post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage found no influence of this drug but noted that further prospective research was needed [33] . As far as we are aware, currently, no previous study has been performed to evaluate the influence of dexamethasone on the incidence of hemorrhage following adenoidectomy. In the present study, no postoperative hemorrhage was observed in any patient during follow-up performed during the two weeks after surgery.This study had several limitations. First, despite the careful monitoring of patients after surgery and the use of the BARF score, there was no objective way to detect postoperative nausea in all pediatric patients, which is why the study findings on the prevalence of postoperative nausea results may be underestimated. Further prospective clinical trials, including the use of new picture scoring systems, are necessary to clarify the incidence of postoperative nausea and the treatment of this condition. Second, in this study, there were no reported cases of postoperative hemorrhage following the adenoidectomy procedure but the patient cohort might have been underpowered. Larger controlled studies with longer patient follow-up should be planned in the future, particularly to resolve the controversy regarding the use of dexamethasone and the risk of postoperative hemorrhage.", "citance": "The study by Czarnetzki et al. to investigate the effect of dexamethasone in children undergoing tonsillectomy was prematurely terminated due to the increased risk of postoperative bleeding observed in the group of patients who were treated with dexamethasone to prevent PONV [27] .", "claims": [{"text": "Dexamethasone decreases risk of postoperative bleeding.", "subject": "Dexamethasone", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Dexamethasone increases risk of postoperative bleeding.", "subject": "Dexamethasone", "is_negation": false}]}

Pories et al. also reported a marked effect of weight-reduction surgery on T2DM incidence, with an annual T2DM incidence of 4.5% in the control group, compared with only 1.0% in the surgery group [20, [58] [59] [60] .The Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) study was a prospective trial of more than 2,000 individuals who underwent a variety of surgical procedures (most commonly, vertical-banded gastroplasty) and matched controls who received standard care [20, 61] . The odds ratio for diabetes in the surgically treated group was 0.14 (95% CI 0.08-0.24) at 2 years and 0.25 (95% CI 0.17-0.38) at 10 years of follow-up.

Patients and methods GRAPE is a prospective observational study, focusing on contemporary antiplatelet use in moderate-risk to high-risk ACS patients receiving PCI. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), (composite of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, urgent revascularization, and stroke) and bleeding events (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium definition) at 1 year of follow-up were analyzed using propensity score adjustment. A subanalysis according to diabetes mellitus (DM) status was performed. Results Out of 2047 registered patients, 469 (22.9%) were diabetic. Complete 1-year follow-up was available in 95.1% of patients. MACE occurred in 12.2 and 7.2% of those patients with and without DM, respectively [adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.27 (0.89\u20131.79), P=0.2]. Observed BARC type \u22653 bleeding risk was not higher in diabetic patients: adjusted HR (95% CI)=1.20 (0.79\u20131.84). In the subgroup of clopidogrel-treated patients (N=238), MACE rate was significantly higher in diabetic compared with nondiabetic cohort [13.4 vs. 9%, adjusted HR (95% CI)=1.68 (1.07\u20132.64), P=0.03]. In the subgroup of ticagrelor-treated or prasugrel-treated patients (N=228), MACE rate did not differ significantly between diabetic and nondiabetic patients: 9.6 versus 5%, adjusted HR (95% CI)=1.35 (0.77\u20132.37), P=0.38. Conclusion In \u2018real-life\u2019 ACS undergoing PCI, diabetic patients have higher \u2013 although not significantly \u2013 MACE rate and no difference in bleeding events. This difference in MACE was significant among clopidogrel-treated patients, whereas when newer antiplatelet agents were used the negative impact of DM on ischemic events was eliminated.", "citation_paragraph": "In the present subanalysis of GRAPE registry according to DM presence, we demonstrated the following. (i) Diabetic patients with ACS undergoing PCI have a higher MACE rate, although not statistically significant, than nondiabetic patients at 1 year of follow-up. (ii) There was no difference in bleeding events among DM and non-DM groups. (iii) Diabetic patients treated with clopidogrel have worse prognosis than nondiabetic patients, whereas when novel antiplatelet agents are used MACE rates are similar between the two groups.Diabetic patients with ACS experience increased shortterm and long-term risk for ischemic and bleeding events [2, 14] . Patients with DM usually have many additional cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities that negatively affect their clinical outcome [15] . The negative impact of DM on outcomes is maintained across the whole ACS spectrum, without any exceptions. Although reasons are likely multifactorial, it is well established that platelets of DM patients are characterized by dysregulation of several signaling pathways, which leads to increased platelet reactivity [5, 16, 17] . Thus, intensity of antiplatelet treatment is of major importance in diabetic patients with ACS [18] [19] [20] . In our study, diabetic patients experienced numerically increased MACE rate mainly because of increased mortality rates. Most possibly Data are expressed as n (%). CI, confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio; MACE, major adverse cardiovascular events; MI, myocardial infarction. a Nondiabetics is the reference category. Fig. 1 Flowchart of the study.because of the small sample size, none of these differences reached statistical significance. Regarding bleeding events, these were balanced between diabetic and nondiabetic patients.Several studies have demonstrated the clinical benefit associated with P2Y 12 receptor antagonism by clopidogrel, particularly in high-risk settings such as ACS [7, 21] . However, a significant number of patients experience poor response to clopidogrel-mediated platelet inhibition and among them are patients with DM [22] . The mechanisms contributing to inadequate clopidogrel-induced antiplatelet effects are likely multifactorial. Some may be specific to this patient population, such as differences in plasma levels of procoagulant factors, oxidative stress, and cellular function, as well as gastrointestinal and hepatic abnormalities that can affect drug absorption and metabolism [16, 17] . In our study, among clopidogrel-treated patients, DM status was associated with an increased risk of MACE compared with the nondiabetic population, mainly because of a difference in mortality [8.8 vs. 5.3%, respectively, adjusted HR (95% CI) = 1.91 (1.08-3.40), P = 0.03]. This is in line with findings from CURE and from PCI in Addition of Clopidogrel to Aspirin and Fibrinolytic Therapy for Myocardial Infarction with ST-Segment Elevation (CLARITY) trial, in which clopidogrel was used in patients with ACS and thrombolysed ST elevation myocardial infarction, respectively. Although the use of clopidogrel versus placebo decreased the incidence of MACE at 1 year in patients with ACS and diabetes in both CURE (HR: 0.78 for nondiabetic vs. 0.81 for diabetic patients, P for interaction nonsignificant) and PCI CLARITY (HR: 0.51 for nondiabetic vs. 0.61 for diabetic patients, P for interaction nonsignificant) trials, a trend toward lower benefit was observed in diabetic patients [7, 21] . This translates to a lower benefit for patients with DM at least with standard clopidogrel doses in the setting of ACS. Our findings in clopidogrel-treated patients are in line with these observations.New, more potent P2Y 12 receptor antagonists prasugrel and ticagrelor are currently recommended as a first-line therapy together with aspirin for ACS treatment [22] . Both agents have been shown to reduce ischemic events in patients with ACS undergoing PCI, with the cost of increased bleeding events [23, 24] . Especially for diabetic patients who represented almost 30% of the ACS patients in prasugrel and ticagrelor trials, the benefits of the more intensive antiplatelet treatment were consistent, with a trend for additional benefit for prasugrel. More specifically, in the Trial to Assess Improvement in Therapeutic Outcomesby Optimizing Platelet Inhibition with Prasugrel-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 38 (TRITON-TIMI 38), prasugrel tended to provide a greater reduction in ischemic events than clopidogrel in diabetic compared with nondiabetic patients with ACS undergoing PCI [3] . There was a higher reduction of cardiovascular death, stroke, and MI at 15 months compared with those without DM (30% relative risk reduction vs. 14%, with P value for interaction close to the statistical significance and equal to 0.09). In the PLATelet Kaplan-Meier curves for 1-year cumulative incidence of MACE, for diabetic and nondiabetic population, after propensity adjustment. CI, confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio; MACE, major adverse cardiovascular events.Antiplatelets in diabetic patients with ACS Hamilos et al. 57inhibition and patient Outcomes (PLATO) diabetic subgroup, the benefit in mortality with ticagrelor was consistent with the overall cohort [8] . Moreover, in the diabetic population, ticagrelor showed similar rates of overall major bleeding compared with clopidogrel, and a higher incidence of non-coronary bypass-related major bleeding.In our registry, sample size was not enough to perform separate analysis for prasugrel and ticagrelor, and thus we pooled those patients under the term 'patients treated with novel antiplatelet agents'. In contrast with clopidogreltreated patients, diabetic patients treated with prasugrel and ticagrelor showed similar MACE rates with nondiabetic patients. When novel agents were directly compared with clopidogrel in the diabetic subpopulation, there was a trend for lower MACE (9.6 vs. In GRAPE registry, a significant number of patients both with diabetes (50.7%) and without diabetes (45.7%) were treated with clopidogrel at discharge. This high percentage of clopidogrel use despite guideline recommendation for patients with ACS reflects the clinical practice in eight different Greek hospitals. GRAPE was performed shortly after the release of the 2011/2012 ESC guidelines suggesting the use of novel agents over clopidogrel [25, 26] and physicians were advised to consider those guidelines in their choice of P2Y12 inhibitor. There are other contemporary registries that have also shown a high rate of clopidogrel use in 'real-life' patients [27, 28] . A specific analysis on factors affecting the implementation of guidelines on the use of antiplatelet agents in GRAPE patients has been previously published [9] .", "citance": "Diabetic patients with ACS experience increased shortterm and long-term risk for ischemic and bleeding events [2, 14] .", "claims": [{"text": "Diabetic patients with acute coronary syndrome experience decreased short-term and long-term risk for bleeding events.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Diabetic patients with acute coronary syndrome experience increased short-term and long-term risk for bleeding events.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Diabetic patients with acute coronary syndrome experience increased short-term and long-term risk for ischemic events.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

HSCs are quiescent, self-renewable progenitor cells that need contact with stromal cells to keep their self-renewal property (Morrison and Scadden, 2014; Schepers et al., 2015) . Once HSCs sense signals for differentiation, asymmetry division occurs and HSCs that lose contact with stromal cells are doomed to differentiate into early lineage-restricted progenitors Tamplin et al., 2015) . Many signature markers of the oligopotent progenitors have been defined, and these progenitor populations can be successfully isolated from LSKs (Lin \u2212 Sca-1 + c-Kit + cells) for further study (Kfoury et al., 2014; Riddell et al., 2014) . Flt3 (also known as Flk2) plays a critical role in lymphoid lineage specification. Multipotent progenitors (MPPs) can generate either granulocyte/monocyte progenitors (GMPs) or common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs; Kondo, 2010) . GMPs generate myeloid cells, accompanied by the loss of lymphoid potential (Iwasaki and Akashi, 2007) , whereas CLPs give rise to all lymphoid cells, coupled with the loss of myeloid potential (Adolfsson et al., 2005) . Thus, these two downstream progenitors govern the myeloid and lymphoid developmental programs independently (Iwasaki and Akashi, 2007) . However, the molecular mechanisms regulating MPP fate decisions between GMPs and CLPs remain largely unknown.Insulin, as the primary anabolic hormone, modulates a variety of physiological processes, including growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and synthesis and breakdown of lipid, protein, and glucose (Samuel and Shulman, 2012) . Insulin binds to its insulin receptor (InsR) to activate the receptor intrinsic tyrosine kinase, leading to activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway (Taguchi and White, 2008; Hers et al., 2011) . Insulin signaling is indispensable for glucose metabolism in cells of the muscle and adipose tissues (Taguchi and White, 2008; Bogan, 2012) . A previous study reported that insulin signaling in Drosophila melanogaster controls the maintenance of hematopoietic progenitors (Shim et al., 2012) . Suppression of insulin signaling leads to skewing differentiation of progenitor cells to myeloid cells (Shim et al., 2012) . It has been reported that diabetic patients display increased numbers of leukocytes, but decreased numbers of lymphocytes (Otton et al., 2004) . Moreover, due to immune dysfunction, diabetic patients are susceptible to microbial infection (Cani et al., 2007; Khan et al., 2014) . However, how the insulin signaling regulates the HSC fate decision in mammalian hematopoiesis is still elusive.Accumulating evidence has shown that transcriptional regulation plays a critical role in differentiation commitment of HSCs into consequent early MPPs (Iwasaki and Akashi, 2007; Rossi et al., 2012) . Before lineage-specific genes are fully expressed, chromatins of progenitors must be maintained in a wide-open state that could be accessible for transcription machinery (Akashi et al., 2003; Iwasaki and Akashi, 2007) . Several transcription factors have been involved in the fate determination of MPPs to the following progenitors, such as GMPs and CLPs (Uhmann et al., 2007; Laurenti et al., 2013;  The lineage commitment of HSCs generates balanced myeloid and lymphoid populations in hematopoiesis. However, the underlying mechanisms that control this process remain largely unknown.

Our findings reveal that the insulin-InsR signaling drives MPP differentiation into lymphoid lineages in early lymphopoiesis, which is essential for maintaining a balanced immune system for an individual organism.Insulin signaling controls MPP differentiation | Xia et al. 2306 Will et al., 2013) . The Ikaros family of transcription factors, characterized by their zinc finger domains, is composed of Ikaros, Aiolos, Helios, Eos, and Pegasus proteins (Georgopoulos, 2002) . Ikaros is highly expressed in the lymphoid-related subset. Ikaros-deficient mice have severe defects in the formation of fetal and adult lymphocytes (Urban and Winandy, 2004; Yoshida et al., 2006) . Of note, the cell number of myeloid cells is increased in Ikaros knockout mice (Iwasaki and Akashi, 2007) , suggesting that Ikaros plays a central role in the hematopoietic lineage decision. It has been reported that Stat3 plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of pluripotency of embryonic stem cells and self-renewal of HSCs (Raz et al., 1999; Chung et al., 2006) . A recent study showed that mice with Stat3 conditional deletion in the hematopoietic system display a shifted lymphoid/myeloid ratio (Mantel et al., 2012) , suggesting that Stat3 may also be implicated in hematopoietic lineage specification. Here, we show that InsR is constitutively expressed in multipotent hematopoietic progenitors.

{"s2orc_id": 9160826, "title": "Placeholder factors in ribosome biogenesis: please, pave my way", "abstract": "The synthesis of cytoplasmic eukaryotic ribosomes is an extraordinarily energy-demanding cellular activity that occurs progressively from the nucleolus to the cytoplasm. In the nucleolus, precursor rRNAs associate with a myriad of trans-acting factors and some ribosomal proteins to form pre-ribosomal particles. These factors include snoRNPs, nucleases, ATPases, GTPases, RNA helicases, and a vast list of proteins with no predicted enzymatic activity. Their coordinate activity orchestrates in a spatiotemporal manner the modification and processing of precursor rRNAs, the rearrangement reactions required for the formation of productive RNA folding intermediates, the ordered assembly of the ribosomal proteins, and the export of pre-ribosomal particles to the cytoplasm; thus, providing speed, directionality and accuracy to the overall process of formation of translation-competent ribosomes. Here, we review a particular class of trans-acting factors known as \"placeholders\". Placeholder factors temporarily bind selected ribosomal sites until these have achieved a structural context that is appropriate for exchanging the placeholder with another site-specific binding factor. By this strategy, placeholders sterically prevent premature recruitment of subsequently binding factors, premature formation of structures, avoid possible folding traps, and act as molecular clocks that supervise the correct progression of pre-ribosomal particles into functional ribosomal subunits. We summarize the current understanding of those factors that delay the assembly of distinct ribosomal proteins or subsequently bind key sites in pre-ribosomal particles. We also discuss recurrent examples of RNA-protein and protein-protein mimicry between rRNAs and/or factors, which have clear functional implications for the ribosome biogenesis pathway.", "citation_paragraph": "The last member of this as yet likely incomplete inventory of factors is the ankyrin-repeat factor Yar1, which directly interacts with the free r-protein S3 (uS3) [174] . S3 consists of two well-defined globular domains, one N-terminal and another C-terminal, preceded and followed by unstructured terminal extensions, respectively [175] . As expertly envisioned by D. Lycan about a decade ago [174] , Yar1 works as a molecular chaperone to keep S3 protected from in vivo agregation [176] .Indeed, as described for many of the above dedicated chaperones, Yar1 directly interacts with free S3 by capturing its N-terminal unstructured domain in a cotranslational manner [152] . Then, Yar1 accompanies S3 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where it seems to assist the proper assembly of S3 into late pre-40S r-particles [176, 177] . The detailed characterization done for Yar1 has suggested the following scenario for the stable assembly of S3: (i) Yar1 co-translationally binds the N-terminal domain of S3, particularly the N-terminal \u03b1-helix of S3, by a concave pocket that is formed by its four ankyrin repeats, while its fourth ankyrin-repeat mediates contacts with the C-terminal domain of S3 [152, 178, 179] . (ii) Importantly, it has been shown that cytoplasmic S3 dimerizes through its C-terminal globular domain in vitro and in vivo [178] . Curiously, in vivo, only one S3 N-terminal domain of the dimer is associated with Yar1, while the second one is bound by the importin-\u03b1 Kap60/Srp1 [150] . Kap60 binds the very N-terminal monopartite NLS of S3, most likely through its major binding site for cargos, and then to importin-\u03b1 Kap95 through its orthodoxal IBB domain [150] ; the S3 NLS is located contiguous to the Yar1-binding site, however, it has been established that the binding of Yar1 and Kap60 to one N-terminal domain of S3 is mutually exclusive, suggesting that one Kap60 molecule rapidly replaces only one Yar1 protein in the (Yar1\u2022S3)2 tetrameric complex [150] .(iii) This asymmetric Kap95\u2022Kap60\u2022S3\u2022S3\u2022Yar1 complex is actively imported into the nucleus, where rapid RanGTP-dependent dissociation of the importer system presumably occurs. Other importins have been proposed to be redundantly able to mediate the import of S3, including Kap123 [150] . (iv) How exactly the transition from Yar1-bound S3 to pre-40S r-particle-bound S3 occurs is unclear; it is worth to mention that these two states are incompatible with each other, since the N-terminal domain of S3, which binds Kap60 and Yar1, is in contact, with several neighbouring rproteins, such as S10 (eS10), S20 (uS10) and S29 (uS14), and specific rRNA residues of the 18S rRNA helix H41 within mature SSUs [44, 91, 141, 178] . Moreover, the Nterminal domain of S3 in the S3\u2022Yar1 complex is rotated ca. 180\u00b0 relative to the C-terminal domain compared to its configuration in mature SSUs, and therefore, away from its contact surfaces in SSUs. Additionally, the dimerization of S3 masks the SSU rRNA-binding site of the C-terminal domain [179] . Initial assembly of S3 within pre-40S rparticles is suspected to occur through the C-terminal domain. This fact implies that the second copy of S3 from the tetramer is released as soon as the assembly of one molecule of S3 initiates and likely assembles in parallel within another orphan pre-40S r-particle. Concomitantly, the remaining Yar1 molecule dissociates and is replaced by the trans-acting factor Ltv1, which seems to have higher affinity for S3 [179, 180] . Ltv1 and Yar1 have partially overlapping binding sites within the N-terminal domain of S3, as demonstrated in vitro [179] . This result is consistent with the reported cryo-EM position of Ltv1 on pre-40S rparticles [21] , and the sites of interaction of Ltv1, described by the CRAC methodology, within helices H41 and H16 of the 18S rRNA, which are located at the head and the shoulder of the SSU, respectively [103] . Importantly, different evidence indicates that, although S3 is present in late pre-40S r-particles containing Ltv1, it is still not bound in its final conformation [21, 101, 177, 181] . Thus, it can be extracted from these particles in the presence of a high salt concentration as a complex with Ltv1 and another 40S assembly factor, Enp1 [101] . Presumably, in pre-40S rparticles, S3 is associated via its C-terminal domain at a position close to its final binding site [180] . However, its Nterminal domain is likely still in the rotated conformation it adopts when bound to Yar1, while it probably interacts similarly to the central region of Ltv1 [179, 182] . (v) The stable incorporation of S3 must occur concomitantly to the release of Enp1 and Ltv1 from cytoplasmic pre-40S rparticles, which is dependent on the phosphorylation of at least Ltv1 at selected serine residues by the kinase Hrr25 (human casein kinase1 \u03b4 or 1\u03b5) [101, 179, 180] . It has been postulated that the release of Ltv1 from pre-40S r-particles allows the N-terminal domain of S3 to assemble into its mature binding site within the context of S10, S20 and S29 and 18S rRNA residues of helix H41 [179, 180] . Indeed, the interaction of the C-terminal part of Ltv1 with pre-40S rparticles seems to be incompatible with the positioning of S3 and the presence of S10 in these particles [21, 103, 177] . The C-terminal domain of S3 also changes its conformation during the cytoplasmic maturation of SSUs so that it acquires its final position by stably interacting with rproteins Asc1, which is the yeast orthologue of mammal RACK1, and S17 (eS17) (for experimental evidence, see references [21, 177] ). More recently, refined cryo-EM analysis of late/cytoplasmic pre-40S r-particles confirmed that S3 is still not bound at its mature site in these precursor particles, however, this study has questioned this particular model, involving the repositioning of the globular N-and C-terminal domains of S3 [183] .Nevertheless, given the intrinsic dynamic nature of the maturation pathway of pre-ribosomal subunits, it could also be feasible that these precursors had already undergone many of the conformational changes, involving S3 and Ltv1 that have been suggested to occur. Moreover, whether these structural rearrangements end with the release of Enp1 and Ltv1 also needs further clarification.", "citance": "Additionally, the dimerization of S3 masks the SSU rRNA-binding site of the C-terminal domain [179] .", "claims": [{"text": "Dimerization of the free r-protein S3 masks the small subunit rRNA-binding site of the C-terminal domain.

The AUG starts are replaced by GUG and especially UUG significantly less frequently than expected under the neutral expectation derived from the frequencies of the respective nucleotide triplet substitutions in non-coding regions and in 4-fold degenerate sites. Thus, AUG is the optimal start codon that is actively maintained by purifying selection. However, purifying selection on start codons is significantly weaker than the selection on the same codons in coding sequences, although the switches between the codons result in conservative amino acid substitutions. The only exception is the AUG to UUG switch that is strongly selected against among start codons. Selection on start codons is most pronounced in evolutionarily conserved, highly expressed genes. Mutation of the start codon to a sub-optimal form (GUG or UUG) tends to be compensated by mutations in the Shine-Dalgarno sequence towards a stronger translation initiation signal. Together, all these findings indicate that in prokaryotes, translation start signals are subject to weak but significant selection for maximization of initiation rate and, consequently, protein production.", "citation_paragraph": "The standard genetic code table contains one start codon, AUG. Over the years, however, many studies have demonstrated that alternative start codons, such as GUG, could be utilized for translation initiation with non-negligible frequencies, i.e. up to 20% non-AUG starts 1, 2 . Recently, it has been shown that, under specific conditions, many different start codons can be used for initiation of translation in Escherichia coli although most of these are employed only rarely, whereas AUG, followed by GUG and then by UUG, remain the principal start signals 3 . In accord with this ranking of the start codons, genes starting with AUG are, on average, expressed at significantly higher levels than genes that start with GUG, and the latter are expressed at higher levels than genes starting with UUG 3, 4 . This is generally the case for genes in other bacteria as well 3 although it has been shown that GC content affects the frequency of genes starting with GUG compared with AUG 2 . Furthermore, in some bacteria, such as Bacillus, UUG is more prevalent and leads to higher levels of protein production than GUG 5 . All start codons are apparently recognized by the dedicated initiator N-Formyl methionyl-tRNA with a CAU anticodon [6] [7] [8] . Recognition of the start codons and discrimination between the initiator and elongation tRNAs depends on the translation initiation factor IF3 that helps to position the correct start codon in the ribosomal P-site before binding the aminoacyl-tRNA 9, 10 . In prokaryotes, the start codon is one of the major translation initiation determinants: replacement of AUG with an alternative start codon, such as GUG, typically leads to a several-fold drop in the translation efficiency [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . In addition to the start codon, an important translation initiation signal is the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence, also known as the ribosome-binding site, which base pairs with a complementary sequence near the 3\u2032-terminus of the 16 S rRNA and increases the efficiency of initiation 17 .A correlation between the type of the start codon and the presence of the SD sequence has been reported: genes with an AUG start are more likely to possess an SD sequence than genes with alternative starts 18 . Translation of leaderless mRNAs that lack the SD sequence appears to require an AUG start codon, and this requirement does not depend on the anticodon complementarity to the start codon because compensatory modification of the anticodon does not restore translation of leaderless mRNAs with alternative start codons 19 . Furthermore, it has , and the proximity of the AUG to the 5\u2032-terminus is an important determinant of initiation efficiency 20 . Thus, the start codon can be expected to be particularly important for initiation of translation in organisms that lack the SD sequence and have many leaderless transcripts, such as Cyanobacteria and some Archaea [21] [22] [23] [24] . In addition to the start codon and the SD sequences, other sequences in the vicinity of the translation start site can affect the efficiency of initiation, in particular, several nucleotides immediately downstream of the start codon; moreover, compensatory relationships between such signals and the SD have been demonstrated [25] [26] [27] . Collectively, these findings indicate that the start codon in itself is a key translation initiation signal that is specifically recognized by the initiation machinery, in particular the ribosomal small subunit, in a tRNA-independent manner, and interacts with other initiation signals.In an attempt to identify the factors that affect evolution of translation starts in prokaryotic genomes, we calculated frequencies of switches between start codons in groups of closely related bacterial and archaeal species. Comparison of these frequencies to those of the respective base triplet switches in non-coding sequences and the switches between the corresponding codons in coding sequence provides evidence of purifying selection on start codons that is, however, weaker than selection affecting the respective non-start codons. Additionally, we identified significant associations between start codon switches and substitutions in the upstream SD sequence and in positions \u22121 to \u22123.", "citance": "Recognition of the start codons and discrimination between the initiator and elongation tRNAs depends on the translation initiation factor IF3 that helps to position the correct start codon in the ribosomal P-site before binding the aminoacyl-tRNA 9, 10 .", "claims": [{"text": "Discrimination between the initiator and elongation tRNAs depends on the translation initiation factor IF3.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "IF3 helps to position the correct start codon in the ribosomal P-site before binding the aminoacyl-tRNA.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Recognition of start codons depends on the translation initiation factor IF3.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Conversely, deregulation of Dnmt3b is thought to generally promote tumorigenesis. However, the role of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b in many types of cancer remains undefined. Here, we show that Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are dispensable for homeostasis of the murine epidermis. However, loss of Dnmt3a-but not Dnmt3b-increases the number of carcinogen-induced squamous tumors, without affecting tumor progression. Only upon combined deletion of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, squamous carcinomas become more aggressive and metastatic. Mechanistically, Dnmt3a promotes the expression of epidermal differentiation genes by interacting with their enhancers and inhibits the expression of lipid metabolism genes, including PPAR-\u03b3, by directly methylating their promoters. Importantly, inhibition of PPAR-\u03b3 partially prevents the increase in tumorigenesis upon deletion of Dnmt3a. Altogether, we demonstrate that Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b protect the epidermis from tumorigenesis and that squamous carcinomas are sensitive to inhibition of PPAR-\u03b3.", "citation_paragraph": "Dnmt3a modifies cytosine at CpG dinucleotides and is responsible for the proper differentiation of murine hematopoietic stem cells and murine neural stem cells (Challen et al., 2011; Mayle et al., 2015; Shlush et al., 2014) . Recently, we and others have shown in human epidermal keratinocytes and murine olfactory sensory neurons, respectively, that Dnmt3a regulates gene expression by cooperating with Tet to maintain high levels of 5-hmC at enhancers (Colquitt et al., 2014; Rinaldi et al., 2016) . Importantly, Dnmt3a is not only frequently mutated in human tumors (Kim et al., 2013) but is perhaps one of the first mutations to occur during tumorigenesis (Shlush et al., 2014) . Using knockout mouse models, we now have demonstrated that Dnmt3a is also tumor-suppressive toward carcinogen-induced epidermal squamous neoplasia. Its loss not only accelerated the onset of tumors, but also increased tumor burden. However, once formed, Dnmt3a-deficient tumors grew, and progressed to carcinomas with the same kinetics and proportions, respectively, as their wild- 5-mC levels at enhancer \"body\" bound by Dnmt3a (n=363) 5-mC levels at enhancer \"body\" not bound by Dnmt3a (n=2734) Bound by Dnmt3a Figure 5 . Depletion of Dnmt3a leads to loss of DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation around its target enhancers. (A) Relative methylation score (CpG count) measured around 363 enhancers bound by Dnmt3a (-5 kb, +5 kb) from independent biological replicates of FACS sorted tumor cells from wild type (n = 2) and Dnmt3a-cKO (n = 2) (p<2.2 \u00c2 10 \u00c016 ). (B) Relative methylation score (CpG count) measured around 2734 enhancers not bound by Dnmt3a (-5 kb, +5 kb) from independent biological replicates of FACS-sorted tumor cells from wild-type (n = 2) and Dnmt3a-cKO (n = 2) animals Figure 5 continued on next page type counterparts. Recent works have shown that the absence of Dnmt3a or Tet2 in hematopoietic stem cells predisposes to leukemia formation (Yang et al., 2016; Rasmussen et al., 2015) , but that restoring the expression of Dnmt3a after the leukemia had developed did not revert the phenotype (Yang et al., 2016) . That said, the role of Dnmt3a in tumorigenesis is tissue specific, since in the lung it does not affect tumor initiation but rather tumor progression (Gao et al., 2011) . Interestingly, in the work of Gao et al., most of the changes in gene expression in Dnmt3a-depleted cells were attributed to alterations in gene body methylation, rather than at promoters. Conversely, in our model, we see significant changes at regulatory elements (i.e. promoters and enhancers) that lead to changes in gene expression in Dnmt3a-depleted epidermal tumors.Our results, together with accumulating evidence from other groups, demonstrates a clear relationship between the levels of Dnmt3a-Tet-5-hmC and tumorigenesis: the inactivation of this axis in adult stem cells predisposes them to tumor initiation. Interestingly, a global reduction of 5-hmC is a hallmark of several cancer types, including squamous cell carcinoma, and is often correlated with poor prognosis Liao et al., 2016; Shi et al., 2016; Ficz and Gribben, 2014; Lian et al., 2012) . Our results indicate that Dnmt3a drives the DNA-methylation, and subsequent hydroxymethylation, of a subset of enhancers that regulate the expression of genes involved differentiation. Conversely, Dnmt3a binds to, and DNA methylates, the promoters of cell proliferation and lipid metabolism genes to repress their expression. Interestingly, however, deletion of Dnmt3a does not result in changes in the specification of the different keratinocyte lineages in the skin (epidermis, hair follicles, and sebaceous glands), nor their homeostasis in adulthood. What is more, even the combined deletion of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, albeit significantly reducing overall DNA methylation levels, did not result in any skin phenotype even in aged mice. On the other hand, we have recently shown that Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are necessary for the self-renewal and differentiation of primary human keratinocytes (Rinaldi et al., 2016) . This apparent contradiction in the phenotypes observed might be due to the fact that our work with human keratinocytes relied on culturing the cells, which was recently shown in murine skin keratinocytes to induce a wound healing damagedlike reversible state that affects their epigenome and transcriptome (Adam et al., 2015) . Thus, in vivo deletion of Dnmt3a might not be sufficient to alter the homeostasis of undamaged skin, but renders the epidermis more susceptible to situations of damage. Accordingly, the epidermis of Dnmt3a-cKO mice responded to the treatment of DMBA/TPA in a much more pronounced manner. This effect might not be specific to Dnmt3a. For instance, Dnmt1 is the DNA methyltransferase most highly expressed in epidermal cells and is responsible for about 70% of DNA methylation levels (Li et al., 1992) . Its depletion causes a strong loss of self-renewal of primary human basal keratinocytes (Sen et al., 2010) . However, its loss in murine epidermis leads to a mild increase in proliferation, and to a partial alopecia, only in very aged mice (Li et al., 2012) . Intriguingly, these results also suggest that Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a/3b exert different functions in epidermal homeostasis, although future work will be required to study these putative differences in depth.Notwithstanding the differences between in vivo and ex vivo studies, our results show that the genomic localization of Dnmt3a is very similar between intact murine keratinocytes and cultured human keratinocytes. Besides its localization at active enhancers of genes involved in epidermal differentiation, Dnmt3a also bound to, and methylated, promoters of genes that regulate cell proliferation and lipid metabolism to repress their expression. Among these genes, were the master regulators of lipid metabolism and adipogenesis PPAR-a and PPAR-g. Interestingly, a number of recent studies have highlighted the importance of a persistent lipid metabolism in promoting tumor transformation, and tumor metastasis in colorectal, liver, breast and oral squamous carcinomas, as well as for enhancing chemoresistance of leukemia stem cells (Pascual et al., 2017; Ma et al., 2016 ; Beyaz et al., 2016; Ye et al., 2016) . The upregulation of these transcription factors upon deregulation of Dnmt3a might predispose the epidermis to develop more tumors, suggesting that an intriguing mechanistic link between lipid metabolism and the epigenetic regulation of tissue homeostasis through DNA methylation, might exist. A recent large clinical association study has already pointed to this by establishing a correlation between the expression of obesity-related genes and changes in the content of DNA methylation (Wahl et al., 2017) . Importantly, our results show that PPAR-g is partially responsible for promoting tumorigenesis in Dnmt3a-deficient epidermis, which considering that human skin tumors express lower levels of Dnmt3a, might provide us with a new therapeutic antitumor avenue against squamous cell carcinomas.", "citance": "On the other hand, we have recently shown that Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are necessary for the self-renewal and differentiation of primary human keratinocytes (Rinaldi et al., 2016) .", "claims": [{"text": "Dnmt3a is necessary for the self-renewal and differentiation of primary human keratinocytes.

While deficiency of the polarity proteins Crumbs and aPKC result in impaired podocyte foot process architecture, the function of basolateral polarity proteins for podocyte differentiation and maintenance remained unclear. Here we report, that Scribble is expressed in developing podocytes, where it translocates from the lateral aspects of immature podocytes to the basal cell membrane and foot processes of mature podocytes. Immunogold electron microscopy reveals membrane associated localisation of Scribble predominantly at the basolateral site of foot processes. To further study the role of Scribble for podocyte differentiation Scribble(flox/flox) mice were generated by introducing loxP-sites into the Scribble introns 1 and 8 and these mice were crossed to NPHS2.Cre mice and Cre deleter mice. Podocyte-specific Scribble knockout mice develop normally and display no histological, ultrastructural or clinical abnormalities up to 12 months of age. In addition, no increased susceptibility to glomerular stress could be detected in these mice. In contrast, constitutive Scribble knockout animals die during embryonic development indicating the fundamental importance of Scribble for embryogenesis. Like in podocyte-specific Scribble knockout mice, the development of podocyte foot processes and the slit diaphragm was unaffected in kidney cultures from constitutive Scribble knockout animals. In summary these results indicate that basolateral polarity signaling via Scribble is dispensable for podocyte function, highlighting the unique feature of podocyte development with its significant apical membrane expansions being dominated by apical polarity complexes rather than by basolateral polarity signaling.", "citation_paragraph": "The glomerular filtration barrier is a unique structure characterized by a precise three dimensional framework of podocytes that elaborate long, regularly spaced, interdigitating foot processes, enveloping the glomerular capillaries. Neighbouring podocytes are connected by the slit diaphragm, a specialized cell junction and the only cell-cell contact of mature podocytes, that bridges the filtration slit between podocyte foot processes [1] . We recently demonstrated that the evolutionarily conserved apical Par3-Par6-aPKC complex (Par complex), a fundamental regulator of apicobasal cell polarity, interacts with the slit diaphragm proteins Nephrin and Neph1 [2] . During podocyte differentiation the Par complex and the cell-cell contacts of immature podocytes migrate from apical towards basal aspects of the podocyte cell membrane, where primary processes and foot processes subsequently develop.In epithelial cells apicobasal cell polarity is established by the asymmetric distribution of three core polarity complexes, the apical Crumbs complex, consisting of Crumbs, PALS1 and PATJ, the apical Par complex localizing at the tight junctions and the basolateral Scribble complex, comprising the proteins Scribble, Dlg and Lgl [3] . In Zebrafish, morpholino knockdown of the apical polarity protein Crumbs2b causes disorganization of podocyte foot process architecture and loss of slit diaphragms [4] . In addition, podocyte-specific deletion of aPKCiota in mice results in foot process effacement, nephrotic syndrome, progressive glomerulosclerosis and death at 3-4 weeks after birth [5, 6] underlining the critical importance of apical polarity complexes for podocyte differentiation and maintenance. However, the relevance of the basolateral Scribble complex for podocyte function is yet completely unclear.Scribble is a large cytoplasmic scaffold protein of the leucinerich repeat (LRR) and PDZ domain (LAP) family with 16 Nterminal LRRs and 4 C-terminal PDZ domains [7] . Targeting of LAP family members to the lateral membrane depends on their LRR domains [8] . In polarized renal epithelial cells Scribble localizes to the adherens junctions and the lateral membrane in an E-Cadherin dependant manner [9] , and knockdown of Scribble results in delayed tight junction assembly, increased cell motility and reduced adhesion similar to the phenotype of E-cadherin knockdown [10] . In wound healing assays Scribble is essential for polarization of migrating cells, recruitment of CDC42 and Rac1 to the leading edge and directed migration [11] .In mice, point mutations of Scribble (circletail and rumpelstilzchen mutations) cause severe impairment of neural tube development with craniorachischisis and neonatal death [12, 13] . A similar phenotype is described for the loop-tail mouse [14] , which displays a mutation in the gene encoding for the planar cell polarity (PCP) protein Vangl2 [15, 16] . Both proteins interact genetically and physically [17, 18, 19] .Scribble is targeted to proteasomal degradation by the high risk papilloma virus protein E6-E6AP ubiquitin-protein ligase complex [20] , and cervical neoplasms are associated with reduced Scribble protein levels [21] . Further, downregulation and mislocalization of Scribble promotes cell transformation and mammary tumorigenesis [22] , suggesting Scribble as a tumor suppressor. In recently Figure 1 . Migration of apical and basolateral polarity proteins during podocyte differentiation. Frozen kidney sections of newborn Wistar rat (P0) were stained using antibodies against the apical membrane protein Podocalyxin, the apical polarity protein Par3 and the basolateral polarity protein Scribble and were subjected to confocal laser microscopy. Since glomerular development is asynchronous, kidneys of newborn rats display various glomerular developmental stages.

{"s2orc_id": 25873774, "title": "Dscam1 in Pancrustacean Immunity: Current Status and a Look to the Future", "abstract": "The Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule 1 (Dscam1) gene is an extraordinary example of diversity: by combining alternatively spliced exons, thousands of isoforms can be produced from just one gene. So far, such diversity in this gene has only been found in insects and crustaceans, and its essential part in neural wiring has been well-characterized for Drosophila melanogaster. Ten years ago evidence from D. melanogaster showed that the Dscam1 gene is involved in insect immune defense and work on Anopheles gambiae indicated that it is a hypervariable immune receptor. These exciting findings showed that via processes of somatic diversification insects have the possibility to produce unexpected immune molecule diversity, and it was hypothesized that Dscam1 could provide the mechanistic underpinnings of specific immune responses. Since these first publications the quest to understand the function of this gene has uncovered fascinating insights from insects and crustaceans. However, we are still far from a complete understanding of how Dscam1 functions in relation to parasites and pathogens and its full relevance for the immune system. In this Hypothesis and Theory article, we first briefly introduce Dscam1 and what we know so far about how it might function in immunity. By focusing on seven questions, we then share our sometimes contrasting thoughts on what the evidence tells us so far, what essential experiments remain to be done, and the future prospects, with the aim to provide a multiangled view on what this fascinating gene has to do with immune defense.", "citation_paragraph": "Pancrustaceans do not have the same mechanisms for acquired (adaptive) immune defenses as vertebrates, i.e., somatic generation of receptor diversity by V(D)J joining of antibody genes followed by clonal selection of antigen-specific lymphocytes (29) , which underlie immunological memory. They instead rely on the evolution of diverse innate immune defenses, which share a number of conserved features with the innate defenses of vertebrates (27, 30) . Nonetheless, some pancrustaceans and other non-vertebrates show evidence of a phenomenon similar to immune memory, termed \"immune priming\" (31) , and they can also somatically generate a limited amount of receptor diversity by alternative splicing [e.g., Ref. (32) ], albeit that this diversity is many orders of magnitude lower than in vertebrates.The link between Dscam1 and pancrustacean immunity has been extensively reviewed in the last few years and we refer readers to the following reviews for more details (6) (7) (8) 10 ). Here we briefly describe evidence linking Dscam1 to the immunefunction hypotheses that have been proposed. Early studies on Dscam1 in D. melanogaster (12) hypothesized that it may function as a signaling receptor or coreceptor during phagocytosis and potentially as an opsonin [i.e., bind to the surface of a pathogen, facilitating its phagocytosis (29) ]. Following this, work on A. gambiae also suggested the hypothesis that Dscam1 could act as a hypervariable pattern-recognition receptor for the immune system (14) . Consistent with Dscam1 playing a role as an opsonin, a shorter soluble Dscam1 protein was found in S2 cell line-conditioned medium and also in haemolymph serum (12) . Furthermore, Dscam1 in the shrimps L. vannamei and Penaeus monodon and the Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis lacks the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail and has been suggested to be secreted directly into the haemolymph (33) (34) (35) . It was also shown that recombinantly expressed Dscam1 protein binds to pathogens [(12), (36 this article has since been retracted), (37) ].Reducing Dscam1 via RNA interference (RNAi), or mutation, or antibody blocking of Dscam1 function, lead to the reduced phagocytosis of dead bacteria (12, 14) , and to the hypothesis that Dscam1 acts as a phagocytosis receptor. The membranebound protein has been hypothesized to interact directly with the bacteria or it could interact with an opsonizing Dscam1 that has already bound to a pathogen (6, 38) . Dong et al. (14) also showed that after A. gambiae infection with bacteria, a fungus, or protozoan parasites, Dscam1 exon 4 produces distinct mRNA splice variants in response to each antigen (exons 6 and 10 were not tested). Dscam1 has generated intense interest in the field of pancrustacean (ecological) immunology largely because it was hypothesized that the somatic diversity generated by this gene has a function in the recognition of diverse parasite and pathogen antigens. However, we are far from understanding whether, and if so how, this might be the case.", "citance": "Following this, work on A. gambiae also suggested the hypothesis that Dscam1 could act as a hypervariable pattern-recognition receptor for the immune system (14) .", "claims": [{"text": "Dscam1 acts as a hypervariable pattern-recognition receptor for the immune system.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Microtubules have been regarded as critical structures for stable neuronal morphology because they serve as tracks for long-distance transport, provide dynamic and mechanical functions, and control local signaling events. Establishment and maintenance of the neuronal microtubule architecture requires tight control over different dynamic parameters, such as microtubule number, length, distribution, orientations, and bundling. Recent genetic studies have identified mutations in a wide variety of tubulin isotypes and microtubule-related proteins in many of the major neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we highlight the functions of the neuronal microtubule cytoskeleton, its architecture, and the way its organization and dynamics are shaped by microtubule-related proteins.", "citation_paragraph": "Minus-End Stabilization. MT severing will produce two new MTs, which can both function as seeds for new outgrowth. Nevertheless, newly created minus ends are typically unstable. Recently, a new family of MT minus-end binding proteins, named CAMSAP/Patronin/Nezha has been characterized and found to specifically recognize MT minus ends and stabilize MTs against depolymerization (Akhmanova and Hoogenraad, 2015) (Figures  1D and3A) . In Drosophila, the CAMSAP family member, named Patronin, associates with free MT minus ends and inhibits their disassembly by the action of the kinesin-13 MT depolymerase (Goodwin and Vale, 2010) . In mammals, all three CAMSAP family members recognize growing MT minus ends and CAMSAP2 and CAMSAP3 form stretches that are stably deposited on the MT lattice generated by minus-end polymerization (Hendershott and Vale, 2014; Jiang et al., 2014) . These stable CAMSAP stretches may stabilize MTs to serve as seeds for MT re-growth ( Figure 3A) . Indeed, repetitive MT plus-end growth and shrinkage was also observed from CAMSAP2 stretches in neurons . Consistent with the idea that stable non-centrosomal MTs have a prominent role in neuronal development, CAMSAP2 is required for neuronal polarity, axon specification, and dendritic branch formation in vitro and in vivo . In worms, loss of the CAMSAP homolog PTRN-1 caused defects in neurite morphology and synaptic vesicle localization (Marcette et al., 2014; Richardson et al., 2014) and also affected the axonal regeneration after injury (Chuang et al., 2014) . Interestingly, MT severing contributes to disassembly of CAMSAP-decorated MT stretches and acts antagonistically to CAMSAP-mediated MT stabilization (Jiang et al., 2014) .Lattice Stabilization. It is well known that neurons contain multiple MT subclasses that differ in stability. A class of short and stable MTs might be constructed from specially modified forms of tubulin (Janke and Kneussel, 2010) or by decoration with specific MT stabilizing proteins, such as microtubule-associated protein 6 (MAP6) or stable tubule only polypeptide (STOP) (Guillaud et al., 1998) . Detyrosination and acetylation of a-tubulin correlate with MT stability in many systems, but in vitro these modifications do not confer a measurable change in MT stability. Recently, a new post-translational modification of tubulin was identified that directly confers stability to MTs (Song et al., 2013) . Biochemical characterization of stable MT fractions demonstrated that polyamination of tubulin is a major modification directly involved in stabilization of neuronal MTs. The accumulate on long-lived MTs (Janke and Kneussel, 2010) . MTs containing polyaminated tubulins are resistant to depolymerization, and inhibiting polyamine synthesis or transglutaminase activity significantly decreases MT stability in neurons. Polyamination may not only provide stability of short MT fragments but also allow them to act as small ''transportable'' MT organizing complexes in neurons. Nevertheless, the transport of MT fragments and the relevance for neuronal functions has been controversial for many years.The CLASP family of MT plus-end binding protein has been described to locally stabilize MTs at various subcellular locations. CLASPs are known to promote MT growth by binding plus ends and promoting rescues (Akhmanova and Steinmetz, 2008) . For instance, CLASPs are present at the Golgi apparatus and found to be critical players in controlling local MT nucleation (Efimov et al., 2007) . It has been proposed that CLASPs at the Golgi membranes are able to coat newly polymerized MT regions, prevent their disassembly, and allow them to serve as seeds for polymerization. Since g-tubulin is required for de novo MT nucleation, it is likely that CLASPs are not directly involved in the formation of new MTs, but in stabilizing pre-existing MT seeds. Consistent with this model, attachment of CLASP to mitochondrial membranes exhibited no potential for MT nucleation (Efimov et al., 2007) . CLASP2 is enriched in neuronal tissues and found to be involved in axon outgrowth and neuronal polarity by acting as local MT stabilizer (Beffert et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2004) . Spatial Arrangement of Microtubules Orienting Microtubules. How do neurons establish and maintain the specific orientations of MTs in axons and dendrites? In the case of parallel axonal arrays, their initial parallel orientations might directly follow from the central centrosomal nucleation, resulting in MTs growing into neurites with their plus end out (Figure 2 ). When centrosomal activity decreases during later stages of development, other mechanisms might be required. The high levels of CAMSAP2 found at the base of the axon may create a local pool of stabilized MT minus ends and promote plus-end out-oriented MT growth in axons. Importantly, the extent of de novo axonal MT nucleation, which would require mechanisms to properly orient the newly formed MTs, is not known. If instead most MTs would be formed by severing existing MTs, their orientations would be correct from the start. In addition, shorter MTs, as well as newly nucleated MTs, could be properly oriented by bundling them to existing MTs in a parallel orientation. Some tau isotypes could act as parallel bundlers, and also the minus-end motor protein kinesin-14, which has MT binding domains in addition to their motor domain, might preferentially crosslink parallel MTs (Braun et al., 2009) .The selective removal of oppositely oriented MTs would also contribute to parallel bundle formation. Dynein anchored to either the cortex or to other MTs will induce sliding of MTs fragments with their plus end leading ( Figure 3B ). Minus-end out-oriented MTs will therefore be pushed back to the cell body and removed from the axon. Indeed, knockdown of dynein in Drosophila neurons increases the number of plus ends growing toward the cell body (Zheng et al., 2008) . Moreover, rapid motility (1 mm/s) of MTs has been directly observed after photobleaching long axonal stretches in rat neurons expressing or injected with fluorescent tubulin (Wang and Brown, 2002) . However, in these experiments the orientation of the moving fragments has never been directly determined. In addition, if such MT movements occur frequently, this should lead to rapid retrograde motility of plus-end associated comets, but such events are rarely observed, suggesting that only a specific subset of non-dynamic MTs undergo rapid movements (Ma et al., 2004) .In dendrites, local nucleation could explain the existence of minus-end out MTs (Nguyen et al., 2014; Ori-McKenney et al., 2012) . Alternatively, MTs nucleated elsewhere could be brought in with their minus end pointing outward. This could be achieved by sliding motors that induce movement between oppositely oriented MT pairs and thereby can bring in minus-end out MTs over the pre-existing plus-end out-oriented MTs (Figures 3C-3I) . Such sliding motors, such as Kinesin-5 and possibly Kinesin-6, are known to operate in dividing cells to form the microtubulebased mitotic spindle (kinesin-5) or anaphase midzone (kinesin-6), often in cooperation with passive non-motor bundlers that promote antiparallel bundling, such as PRC1 (Subramanian and Kapoor, 2012) . Consistently, several papers have reported a role for the Kinesin-6 MKLP1 in the formation of the anti-parallel dendritic MT array (Lin et al., 2012) . In principle, because force is generated on both MTs, this mechanism could also lead to retrograde motility of plus-end out-oriented MTs and thereby deplete them from the dendrites (Figures 3H and 3I ). However, this would only work if these MTs are not connected to other structures and if the sliding speed is faster than the MT growth rate, which appears not to be the case for Kinesin-6 and Kinesin-5.Recent work has shown that the nearly uniform dendritic MT orientation of C. elegans DA9 and PHC neurons is almost completely reversed upon knockdown of the Kinesin-1 homolog unc-116 (Yan et al., 2013) . A model was proposed in which the additional MT binding site in the tail region of the Kinesin-1 facilitates the crosslinking and sliding of anti-parallel MTs ( Figure 3D ). Alternatively, Kinesin-1 could be attached to the cortex or other immobile structures to drive MT sliding with the minus end leading ( Figures 3C and 3D) . In both cases, the sliding speed will be faster than the MT polymerization rate, and therefore these mechanisms could really deplete the dendrite from plus-end outward MTs, because their growth cannot catch up ( Figures 3H  and 3I) . Again, such retrograde transport of polymerizing MTs should result in rapid retrograde motility of plus-end associated comets, which has so far not been reported.In dendrites with uniform minus-end out polarity, branch points also pose a challenge, because MTs should grow exclusively into the primary branch that leads to cell body. Work in Drosophila proposed that growing MTs approaching a branch are guided toward the plus ends of pre-existing MTs by a Kinesin-2 that interacts with the growing plus end through EB1 and APC ( Figure 3J ) (Mattie et al., 2010) . Subsequent in vitro reconstitution experiments have demonstrated that kinesins interacting with dynamic plus ends through EB proteins can indeed establish MT guidance Doodhi et al., 2014) .Motor-based MT guidance and sliding, possibly combined with passive bundling in preferred orientations, thus appear versatile strategies to bias the overall polarity orientations of MT arrays (Subramanian and Kapoor, 2012) . Interestingly, Kinesin-1 based relative sliding of MTs has also been proposed to provide the driving force for initial neurite outgrowth in cultured neuronlike cells from Drosophila (Lu et al., 2013) . This model implicates that the protrusive MTs are being pushed outward with their minus end leading, unless the binding of the Kinesin-1 motor domains is somehow biased toward the guidance MT (Figures 3D-3G ). Recent work reported that, in more mature neurons, such rapid Kinesin-1 based MT sliding is reduced by the slow bipolar sliding motor MKLP1 (Kinesin-6) (del Castillo et al., 2015) .Bundling, Spacing, and Spine Entries. Most neuronal MTs appear to be heavily bundled. Tau and MAP2 are two abundant neuronal MAPs that can induce MT bundling (Dehmelt and Halpain, 2005) . MAP2 is exclusively located to dendrites, where it decorates stable MTs, whereas tau is present in both axons and dendrites, but is enriched in the distal axon. The mechanisms underlying these polarized distributions are largely unknown. Interestingly, expressing tau and MAP2 in non-neuronal cells induces the formation of MT bundles with a distinct spacing between MTs of 20 nm and 65 nm, respectively (Chen et al., 1992) . This spacing nicely corresponds with the spacing found between MTs in dendrites (65 nm) and small caliber axons without neurofilaments (20 nm), suggesting that tau and MAP2 are involved in the proper spatial organization of the neuronal MTs (Chen et al., 1992) . Whether tau and MAP2 promote MT bundling in parallel or anti-parallel orientations, respectively, is currently unknown.Despite the extensive MT bundling, growing MTs frequently leave the dendritic shaft to penetrate into dendritic spines (Jaworski et al., 2009) . Mechanically, MTs behave as relatively rigid rods and therefore tend to grow in straight lines (Hawkins et al., 2010) , suggesting that specific mechanisms underlie spine entries. Indeed, recent work reported that MT entries depend on the actin cytoskeleton and the actin-binding protein Drebrin A, which was suggested to link MT plus ends to actin (Merriam et al., 2013) (Figure 3K ). Local calcium transients were found to promote spine entries by increasing actin polymerization, suggesting that MT spine entries are regulated by synaptic activity.", "citance": "Indeed, knockdown of dynein in Drosophila neurons increases the number of plus ends growing toward the cell body (Zheng et al., 2008) .", "claims": [{"text": "Dynein knockdown in Drosophilia neurons increases the number of plus ends growing towards the cell body.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Dynein knockdown in Drosophilia neurons reduces the number of plus ends growing towards the cell body.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Knockdown of dynein in Drosophila neurons increases the number of microtubule plus-ends growing toward the cell body of each neuron.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Upregulation of dynein in Drosophila neurons increases the number of microtubule plus-ends growing toward the cell body of each neuron.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}

The transcriptional activation of SREBPs requires the key protein SCAP (SREBP-cleavage activating protein) to translocate their precursors from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi for subsequent proteolytic activation, a process tightly regulated by a cholesterol-mediated negative feedback loop. Our previous work showed that the SCAP/SREBP-1 pathway is significantly upregulated in human glioblastoma (GBM), the most deadly brain cancer, and that glucose-mediated N-glycosylation of SCAP is a prerequisite step for SCAP/SREBP trafficking. More recently, we demonstrated that microRNA-29 (miR-29) mediates a previously unrecognized negative feedback loop in SCAP/SREBP-1 signaling to control lipid metabolism. We found that SREBP-1, functioning as a transcription factor, promotes the expression of the miR-29 family members, miR-29a, -29b and -29c. In turn, the miR-29 isoforms reversely repress the expression of SCAP and SREBP-1. Moreover, treatment with miR-29 mimics effectively suppressed GBM tumor growth by inhibiting SCAP/SREBP-1 and de novo lipid synthesis.

To activate these CD8(+) T cells, antigen-presenting cells (APCs) must initially acquire tumor cell-associated antigens. The major source of tumor antigens is dead tumor cells, but little is known about how APCs in draining lymph nodes acquire and crosspresent these antigens. Here we show that CD169(+) macrophages phagocytose dead tumor cells transported via lymphatic flow and subsequently crosspresent tumor antigens to CD8(+) T cells. Subcutaneous immunization with irradiated tumor cells protects mice from syngenic tumor. However, tumor antigen-specific CD8(+) T cell activation and subsequent antitumor immunity are severely impaired in mice depleted with CD169(+) macrophages. Neither migratory dendritic cells (DCs) nor lymph node-resident conventional DCs are essential for the crosspresentation of tumor antigens. Thus, we have identified CD169(+) macrophages as lymph node-resident APCs dominating early activation of tumor antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells.", "citation_paragraph": "Given the selective phagocytosis of dead cells by CD169 + macrophages, it became imperative to examine the role of these macrophages in the crosspresentation of dead tumor cell antigens. We previously generated genetically targeted mice expressing the diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) under the control of the CD169 gene (CD169-DTR mice) (Miyake et al., 2007) . In these mice, DT injection induced the transient deletion of macrophages located in the MZ of the spleen. We also found that CD169 + sinus macrophages were completely depleted in It is assumed that injection of dead tumor cells killed ex vivo by X-ray irradiation mimic the generation of dead tumor cells by X-ray irradiation or by chemotherapy. Based on the results obtained with the tumor vaccination model, we hypothesized that the induction of antitumor immunity by tumor degradation in vivo might also be controlled by CD169 + macrophages. In order to prove this idea, we examined the role of CD169 + macrophages in immune activation subsequent to degradation of the established tumors. Kroemer and his colleagues revealed that EG7 tumor killed by systemic oxaliplatin primed CD8 + T cells from the tumor-draining LNs for interferon-g (IFN-g) production (Ghiringhelli et al., 2009 ). WT and CD169-DTR mice bearing established tumors were intraperitoneally injected with oxaliplatin to induce tumor degradation.

Total LN phagocytes from mice injected with OVA-expressing dead cells were enriched by magnetic beads and then cocultured in vitro with OT-I cells. APCs from DT-treated CD169-DTR mice were unable to crosspresent dead cell-associated OVA to CD8 + T cells, as assessed by [3 H]-thymidine incorporation ( Figure 4A ) and by IFN-g production ( Figure 4B ). In contrast, when the total APCs were cocultured in vitro with dead cell OVA, CD169-DTR APCs were comparable presenters to WT APCs ( Figure S4A ). These observations suggest that conventional CD11c + DCs are intact in their ability to crosspresent dead tumor cell-associated antigens in CD169 + macrophage-depleted mice, but they do not have access to these antigens accumulated in the LN sinus.To directly address whether CD169 + macrophages can crosspresent dead cell-associated antigens, we purified these cells by flow cytometry on the basis of CD169 and CD11c expression (Figure 4C , top; Figure S4B ).

Recent literatures have documented that MSCs can self-assemble into 3D spheroids with a greater capacity for differentiation into various cell types when grown on chitosan (CS), a biopolymer. The genomic modulation occurring in these MSC spheroids is thus of essential importance for understanding their uniqueness and therapeutic potentials. In this study, 3D spheroids self-assembled from human umbilical cord MSCs grown on CS membranes were analyzed by mRNA as well as microRNA microarrays, which helped identify the critical signaling events that may alter the cellular functions during the spheroid forming process.   RESULTS Genes screened from mRNA and microRNA cross-correlation analyses were further confirmed with the quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis. Results revealed the regulation of a significant number of calcium-associated genes, which suggested the crucial role of calcium signaling in CS-derived MSC spheroids. In addition, many genes associated with the multilineage differentiation capacities and those associated with the antiinflammatory and antitumor properties of MSCs were upregulated. The genetic modulation was significantly more remarkable and endured longer for MSC spheroids derived on CS substrates compared to those derived on a non-adherent (polyvinyl alcohol) substrate.   CONCLUSIONS Based on the study, the culture substrates used to prepare 3D MSC spheroids may predefine their properties through cell-substrate interaction.", "citation_paragraph": "The gene expression for a group of growth factors and receptors was modulated in MSCs on CS vs. TCPS, as listed in Table 3 . These included TGF-\u03b23 (transforming growth factor beta 3), BMP2 (bone morphogenetic protein 2), HGF (hepatocyte growth factor), IGF1R (insulinlike growth factor 1 receptor), KDR (kinase insert domain receptor, also known as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, VEGFR2) and KIT (the stem cell factor receptor, also known as CD117). The regulation of these genes may influence the function and fate of stem cells. Several WNT signaling related genes were also enhanced for MSCs on CS including the WLS (Wntless protein), WNT2 (wingless-type MMTV integration site family member 2), LEF1 (lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1), TCF7 (transcription factor 7), DAAM1 (dishevelled associated activator of morphogenesis 1), and CXXC4 (CXXC finger protein 4). The WNT proteins and WNT signaling pathway are known to control cell specification and fate during embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis. WNT2, a member of WNT family, can promote the earliest aspects of lung airway smooth muscle development [40] , and accelerate cardiac myocyte differentiation from ES-cell derived mesodermal cells through the non-canonical WNT pathway [41] . WLS is a multipass transmembrane protein, and was found to control the secretion of WNT proteins [42] . The TCF/LEF family is the downstream proteins in the canonical WNT/ \u03b2-catenin pathway. In response to WNT signals, TCF/LEF members present as a switch to modulate the transcription of numerous target genes from repression to activation as binding with \u03b2-catenin [43] . DAAM1 was identified as a downstream protein interacting with Dishevelled (Dvl), which mediates the non-canonical Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway. A study indicated that DAAM1 may play a crucial role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton and tissue morphogenesis [44] . On the other hand, one of the negative regulators of WNT/ \u03b2-catenin signaling pathway, CXXC4, was also enhanced for MSCs on CS [45] . Two other development-related genes worth mentioning are RARB (retinoic acid receptor beta) and EGR2 (early growth response 2). RARB is a nuclear receptor for retinoic acid (RA) which is a vitamin A-derived, nonpeptidic, small lipophilic molecule. The RA signaling during embryo development has been extensively investigated [46] .

Instead of revealing isolated cellular compartments, the picture now emerging shows organelles as largely interdependent structures that can communicate through membrane contact sites (MCSs). MCSs are sites where opposing organelles are tethered but do not fuse. MCSs provide a hybrid location where the tool kits of two different organelles can work together to perform vital cellular functions, such as lipid and ion transfer, signaling, and organelle division. Here, we focus on MCSs involving the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), an organelle forming an extensive network of cisternae and tubules. We highlight how the dynamic ER network regulates a plethora of cellular processes through MCSs with various organelles and with the plasma membrane.", "citation_paragraph": "Cargo from the PM is internalized into vesicles destined for the endocytic pathway. Endosomes sort cargo as they mature and traffic. Very early shows that the division machinery Drp1 (cyan) is localized to the position where an ER tubule crosses over a mitochondrial constriction (first two time frames). As the mitochondria divide, the Drp1 punctum splits and the ER tubules bridge the gap to maintain contact with both Drp1-labeled ends on daughter mitochondria (arrows). Images were provided by J. Lee. (C) Dynamic ER tubules are recruited and rearrange around endosome cargo-sorting domains to promote endosome fission. Time-lapse live-cell imaging of the ER (green), LEs (red), and epidermal growth factor (EGF) cargo (blue) shows an endosome bud growing through an ER ring (arrows). As the ring closes, the bud undergoes fission (compare the third and fourth time frames). Reproduced from (61).in their maturation, endosomes acquire ER MCSs so that most early endosomes and all late endosomes (LEs) are bound to the tubular ER network (52, 53) . Endosomes are so tightly tethered to the ER that they will pull ER tubules with them as they traffic with molecular motors along microtubules (MTs), as visualized by live-cell imaging (Fig. 1C ). An individual endosome can form several ER MCSs, and cumulatively these contacts cover~2 to 5% of the cytoplasmic surface (52, 54) . The past decade has revealed several functions for ER MCSs with endosomes, including lipid trafficking, cargo sorting, endosome trafficking, and fission (55) . VAPs regulate multiple functions at ERendosome MCSs. In animal cells, VAPs interact with at least three endosome-localized FFATcontaining partners: OSBP, STARD3, and ORP1L (Fig. 3, A and C) . The VAP-ORP1L interaction is important to determine the direction of LE trafficking on MTs. ORP1L is an endosomal ORP that is implicated in lipid homeostasis at ER MCSs (Fig. 3) . Consistently, ORP1L contains a hydrophobic pocket that may be involved in cholesterol transport at ER-endosome MCSs (Fig. 3C) (56, 57) . ORP1L is considered a sterol sensor because its binding to VAPs on the ER depends on endosomal cholesterol levels (56, 57) . When the level is high, ORP1L binds to cholesterol and the interaction with VAPs is precluded. Conversely, depletion of endosomal cholesterol frees ORP1L to interact with VAPs, which establishes an MCS between endosomes and the ER. This MCS influences the direction of LE trafficking on MTs. Rab7 GTPase also assembles into VAP-ORP1L complexes, resulting in the displacement of the dynein from the LE surface and halting the retrograde trafficking of LEs to the cell center (57) . VAPs can also promote kinesin loading onto LEs when in complex with the ER membrane protein protrudin. The VAP-protrudin complex binds to Rab7 to recruit kinesin-1 to promote anterograde trafficking of LEs to the PM (Fig. 3, A and C) VAPs also contribute to phospholipid homeostasis at ER-endosome MCSs. This is achieved through coordination with OSBP and the endosome-localized protein sorting nexin 2 (Snx2) to allow the ER-localized phosphatase Sac1 to process PI4P (Fig. 3C) (59) . VAP depletion causes an increase in PI4P on early and late endosomal membranes and a ripple of downstream effects. The increase in endosomal PI4P boosts the levels of endosomal actin, which nucleates actin comets and alters endosomal motility, and this also reduces cargo trafficking from the endosome to the TGN (59).ER-endosome MCSs can regulate cargo sorting directly. At least one key growth factor receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is dephosphorylated by an ER-localized phosphatase, Ptp1B, and this leads to its internalization and subsequent degradation. EGFR and Ptp1B can be colocalized by immuno-EM at MCSs, and Ptp1b depletion by small interfering RNA decreases the number of ER-endosome MCSs and reduces the number of intraluminal vesicles per multivesicular body (60) . Lastly, ER MCSs regulate cargo sorting by defining the position of endosome bud fission in a manner similar to their role on mitochondria. Both early endosomes and LEs sort out cargo to be degraded and material to be recycled into vacuolar and budding domains, respectively. ER tubules are recruited to the saddle between these domains, and fission follows MCS formation (Fig. 2C) (61) . It is not known what machinery tethers this interaction. However, an ER-localized isoform of the MT-severing protein spastin may drive the final step of bud fission at the MCSs. When spastin is depleted, ER MCSs with endosome buds still form and accumulate but the efficiency of ERassociated bud fission is reduced (62).", "citance": "This is achieved through coordination with OSBP and the endosome-localized protein sorting nexin 2 (Snx2) to allow the ER-localized phosphatase Sac1 to process PI4P (Fig. 3C) (59) .", "claims": [{"text": "ER-localized phosphatase Sac1 processes PI4P through coordination with OSBP and the endosome-localized protein sorting nexin 2.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

These three homologous zinc metallopeptidases trim N-terminally extended precursor antigenic peptides down to the correct length for loading onto the MHC-I but can also destroy some antigenic peptides by over-trimming, therefore, influencing the antigenic peptide repertoire and immunodominance hierarchy. Polymorphic variation has been found to affect their trimming function and predispose to human disease in complex and poorly understood patterns. Structural and biochemical analysis have pointed toward a complicated trimming mechanism that involves a major conformational transition during each catalytic cycle. Here, we provide an overview of current knowledge on the structure and mechanism of action of those enzymes with a focus on the proposed key role of conformational dynamics in their function.", "citation_paragraph": "A multitude of genome-wide association studies during the last decade have provided evidence that several coding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes of ERAP1 and ERAP2 are linked with predisposition to human disease. The most pronounced example is the association of ERAP1 SNPs with ankylosing spondylitis (35, 36) , a highly heritable, inflammatory disease with autoimmune etiology that is closely associated with the HLA-B*27 allele. Epistasis between ERAP1 SNPs and HLA alleles further validated the functional significance of those findings (37) . In addition, ERAP1 is associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (38) and Beh\u00e7et disease (39), whereas ERAP2 is associated with Crohn's disease (40) and birdshot chorioretinopathy (41) . Notably, both ERAP1 and ERAP2 have been associated with psoriasis (42, 43) , a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease that has also been associated with an IRAP coding SNP (44) . There are also accumulating evidence that the polymorphic variation in these enzymes may contribute to predisposition to cancer (45, 46) . Several functional studies have demonstrated that these disease-associated SNPs lead to altered enzymatic activity, antigen (32) ] bound onto HLA-B27 (blue, PDB 4G9D) poised to trim the partially bound KK10 peptide. Only the last three C-terminal residues of the peptide have been retained inside the peptide-binding groove of the HLA-B27 (pocket F), whereas the N-terminus of the peptide can approach the catalytic center of ERAP1 partially dissociating from pocket A. More closed ERAP1 conformations, such as those obtained by X-ray crystallography or SAXS until now, would generate too many steric clashes with the major histocompatibility complex class I to allow trimming of short peptides while still bound. presentation, and cytotoxic responses (47) (48) (49) (50) (51) . In particular, distinct ERAP1 haplotypes have been grouped as \"normal, \" \"hypofunctional, \" or \"hyperfunctional\" in terms of their ability to generate specific antigenic epitopes (19) . Mapping these SNPs on the crystallographic structures revealed that most of the polymorphic sites are located distally from the active site and thus their effect in the catalytic activity cannot be readily inferred. One exception is the rs2549782 SNP of ERAP2 that codes for the variation N392K, which resides adjacent to the substrate N-terminus-binding cleft ( Figure 1C) . After obtaining the crystal structures of both ERAP2 variants, a structural comparison revealed that the side-chain of 392 assumes different orientations (49) . In particular, K392 was oriented toward the N-terminal amine group of the bound product, introducing a highly unfavorable electrostatic interaction with the substrate, which could interfere with transition-state stabilization resulting in reduced catalytic efficiency. This substitution also led to rearrangement of residues around the S1 specificity pocket that may explain the changes in the specificity profiles of two alleles (49) .The two most common disease-associated ERAP1 SNPs are rs30187 that codes for the K528R variant, and rs27044 that codes for Q730E. Both these SNPs have been repeatedly shown to affect the enzymatic activity of ERAP1. In particular, the 528R variant displays lower enzymatic activity compared to 528K, whereas the 730E variant affects both activity but also the length preference toward shorter peptides (34, 47, 50, 51) . Given that position 730 lies within the internal cavity of ERAP1, which is in close proximity to a site that has been proposed as a regulatory region (52, 53) , the effect of this polymorphism can be rationalized by the influence of the negative charge introduced by the Q730E change on the C-terminus of long substrates (34) . However, this is not the case for the solvent exposed position 528 that has no direct access to the peptide-binding cavity (Figures 1A,B) . It has been proposed that the nature of the amino acid at position 528 can affect the structural dynamics of the hinge domain III and, therefore, indirectly influence the dynamic equilibrium between the \"open\" and \"closed\" states of ERAP1. This hypothesis was explored by a comparative analysis of the dynamics of ancestral ERAP1 and its 528R and 730E variants using molecular dynamics simulations (34) . These simulations suggested that while the 730E variant samples approximately the same conformational space as the native ERAP1, the 528R variant is limited to more \"semiclosed\" configurations, as those displayed by the X-ray structures of IRAP (Figure 1D ). Considering that substrate access is more limited in \"semi-closed\" conformations, a perturbation of the conformational equilibrium in the 528R variant could explain its reduced activity.", "citance": "Epistasis between ERAP1 SNPs and HLA alleles further validated the functional significance of those findings (37) .", "claims": [{"text": "ERAP1 SNPs are epistatic to HLA alleles for ankylosing spondylitis.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Longer-term associations of early linear growth faltering include impairment of motor development, cognition, educational and economic achievement, chronic disease, and low offspring birth size (6) . Fetal growth restriction is another major predictor of adverse outcomes beyond the neonatal period, including mortality, stunting, and impaired neurodevelopment (7) (8) (9) (10) . Recognition of the unique and compelling opportunities for optimizing the environment of both the fetus and young child has given prominence to the concept of \"The First 1000 Days\" (6, 11) and has prompted numerous trials directed either to early postnatal life or, by means of improving maternal nutrition, to life during gestation. The environmental factors underlying stunting and adverse birth outcomes are undoubtedly complex and potentially synergistic, but maternal undernutrition can clearly result in deficits of nutrients required for physical growth. Trials of maternal supplements, typically initiated during the second trimester of gestation, consisting of iron and folate, multimicronutrients with or without lipids, or protein-energy supplements, have frequently had some positive effect on offspring birth size, including length. However, the effect sizes of such maternal interventions have typically been quite modest (12) (13) (14) (15) .Advantages of initiating maternal nutrition supplements before conception have been suggested, particularly to correct both maternal underweight and micronutrient deficiencies before conception (16) (17) (18) .

Objectives: The aim of this work was to study regional variations in PDA treatment in very preterm infants (\u226431 weeks of gestation), its relation to differences in perinatal characteristics, and associations with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and survival without major neonatal morbidity. Methods: This was a population-based cohort study in 19 regions in 11 European countries conducted during 2011 and 2012. A total of 6,896 infants with data on PDA treatment were included. The differences in infant characteristics were studied across regions using a propensity score derived from perinatal risk factors for PDA treatment. The primary outcomes were a composite of BPD or death before 36 weeks postmenstrual age, or survival without major neonatal morbidity. Results: The proportion of PDA treatment varied from 10 to 39% between regions (p < 0.001), and this difference could not be explained by differences in perinatal characteristics. The regions were categorized according to a low (<15%, n = 6), medium (15-25%, n = 9), or high (>25%, n = 4) proportion of PDA treatment. Infants treated for PDA, compared to those not treated, were at higher risk of BPD or death in all regions, with an overall propensity score adjusted risk ratio of 1.33 (95% confidence interval 1.18-1.51). Survival without major neonatal morbidity was not related to PDA treatment. Conclusions: PDA treatment varies largely across Europe without associated variations in perinatal characteristics or neonatal outcomes. This finding calls for more uniform guidance for PDA diagnosis and treatment in very preterm infants.", "citation_paragraph": "In this population-based study of very preterm infants across Europe, we found that PDA treatment varied 3-fold (<28 weeks) to 9-fold (28-31 weeks) between different regions. This regional variation was not explained by differences in perinatal characteristics. Our data confirm previous observations [16, 17] that GA is the most important predictor for PDA treatment, with a sharp decrease in PDA treatment from 23 to 31 weeks of gestation. The risk of BPD or death in infants treated for PDA was increased compared with untreated infants, and the association between PDA treatment and BPD was further strengthened when restricting the analyses to survivors to \u2265 36 weeks of gestation. Finally, PDA treatment was not associated with survival without major neonatal morbidity.The incidence of any PDA treatment in EPICE was similar to that in other population-based European studies [16, 18, 19] , and slightly lower than reported in Canada and Japan [20] . In the NICHD Neonatal Research Network in the USA, the proportion of infants <28 weeks with a PDA diagnosis varied from 26 to 78% between different centers in 2003-2007, with a 3-fold variation in the use of pharmacological treatment and a 4-fold difference in PDA surgery, but data permitting a more detailed understanding of variations were lacking [17] . In EPICE, we found that differences in perinatal characteristics be- tween the regions did not explain the variations in PDA treatment.The evidence base for PDA treatment is weak and has been debated in the last decade [5, 21, 22] . The large regional variation in treatment in EPICE could be driven by different treatment guidelines (or their absence) and use of echocardiography may differ between centers. Furthermore, the definition of a hemodynamically significant PDA may vary [23] . Recent data show that early PDA screening is associated with higher rates of PDA treatment, but lower in-hospital mortality [24] . Nevertheless, the lack of an association between PDA treatment and improved neonatal outcome supports the questioning of liberal PDA treatment. It should also be noted that up to 26% of infants born at 28-31 weeks were treated for PDA in some regions, which cannot be considered evidencebased given the high spontaneous closure rate [7] .Whereas PDA treatment was found to be associated with an increased risk of BPD or death, this study cannot provide evidence for an underlying explanation. The severity of respiratory distress syndrome may have determined both the risk of PDA treatment and of BPD. In addition, both PDA and BPD are linked to conditions of inflammation -before and after birth -such as pPROM and neonatal infections [25] .The highest risk for BPD or death was seen after PDA surgery. This association may have suffered from confounding by indication. However, given earlier findings of a strong association between PDA surgery and BPD risk [3] and the large increases in risk for BPD or death associated with surgery in our study, we cannot exclude that the surgical procedure per se or other factors may contribute to this increased risk.The age at PDA surgery following prior medical PDA treatment did not differ between low, medium or hightreatment regions. However, primary surgery was performed 2-3 weeks earlier in high compared to low-and medium-treatment regions. In high-treatment regions, the access to PDA surgery onsite was also higher. This could indicate that centers in high-treatment regions have adopted a more proactive, early surgical approach, while the other regions use primary surgery more restrictively.High-treatment regions used earlier pharmacological PDA treatment than the other regions. In other studies, the timing of pharmacological PDA treatment after extremely preterm birth has not been associated with the risk of PDA surgery or death, and expectant PDA management has not been associated with increased risk of BPD [26] , although contradictive observations have been c Results from a generalized linear mixed model adjusted for propensity score for PDA treatment. The propensity score for PDA treatment, i.e. a single index variable summarizing the pretreatment perinatal characteristics, was estimated from the presence of preeclampsia/eclampsia, spontaneous onset of labor, pPROM, maternal infection as indication for delivery, antenatal corticosteroid treatment, mode of delivery, GA, birth weight, infant sex, small for GA, and use of mechanical ventilation on the first day of life. reported [27] . We hypothesize that early timing of treatment may be one of the underlying factors leading to a higher treatment incidence, since spontaneous closure may not occur until after an early treatment decision has been made. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the infants born at 28-31 weeks of gestation were treated at the same postnatal age as infants born at <28 weeks of gestation.The strengths of this cohort study include its population-based design, the standardized data collection, and the large number of infants, regions, and countries included. Detailed data on PDA treatment were available and we believe that our results are generalizable to most European neonatal intensive care settings.The main limitation is the lack of echocardiographic PDA characteristics, which hinders us from determining the PDA incidence in the untreated group, and studying the hemodynamic significance of the PDA in infants receiving treatment. Although there may be differences in the incidence of hemodynamically significant PDA between the regions, we do not think that such potential differences could be the only explanation for a 4-fold difference in PDA treatment between the regions.Furthermore, it is a limitation that we could not take the neonatal disease burden into account in our propensity score model for PDA treatment. To avoid confounding, it is essential that factors used to predict treatment occur before the treatment. Since we did not have the exact dates of diseases, such as sepsis, or start and stop date of each episode of mechanical ventilation, we could not use these factors in the propensity score. Although we could not disentangle the temporal relationships with PDA treatment, adjusting for the total duration of mechanical ventilation and number of confirmed septicemias in supplementary analyses did not change the association between PDA treatment and an increased risk of BPD. Possible residual confounding and confounding by indication are additional limitations. Finally, we did not register if paracetamol had been administered to the infants.In conclusion, there is a 4-fold variation in PDA treatment rates between European regions that could not be explained by differences in the perinatal characteristics between the regions. Liberal treatment was not associated with a lower risk of BPD or death, nor was it associated with a higher chance of survival free of major neonatal morbidity. It is also notable that a large proportion of infants born at 28-31 weeks are treated for PDA, although the spontaneous closure rate is known to be high in this group. These findings support a call for uniform guidance for the management of PDA in very preterm infants.", "citance": "Recent data show that early PDA screening is associated with higher rates of PDA treatment, but lower in-hospital mortality [24] .", "claims": [{"text": "Early patent ductus ateriosus (PDA) screening decreases in-hospital mortality.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Early patent ductus ateriosus (PDA) screening increases in-hospital mortality.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Early patent ductus ateriosus (PDA) screening increases the rate of patent ductus ateriosis treatment.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Early patent ductus ateriosus (PDA) screening reduces the rate of patent ductus ateriosis treatment.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}
{"s2orc_id": 3075111, "title": "TCR Signaling in T Cell Memory", "abstract": "T cell memory plays a critical role in our protection against pathogens and tumors. The antigen and its interaction with the T cell receptor (TCR) is one of the initiating elements that shape T cell memory together with inflammation and costimulation. Over the last decade, several transcription factors and signaling pathways that support memory programing have been identified. However, how TCR signals regulate them is still poorly understood. Recent studies have shown that the biochemical rules that govern T cell memory, strikingly, change depending on the TCR signal strength. Furthermore, TCR signal strength regulates the input of cytokine signaling, including pro-inflammatory cytokines. These highlight how tailoring antigenic signals can improve immune therapeutics. In this review, we focus on how TCR signaling regulates T cell memory and how the quantity and quality of TCR-peptide-MHC interactions impact the multiple fates a T cell can adopt in the memory pool.", "citation_paragraph": "T cell receptor signals are conditioned by different biophysical and biochemical parameters. The affinity of the TCR\u03b1\u03b2 heterorodimer for antigenic peptide-MHC molecules (pMHC), the dose of antigen presented on the surface of APCs, and the duration of the TCR-pMHC interaction, all determine the strength of TCR signals (1, 2) . For a long time, the prevalent idea has been that memory development requires an intermediate to high overall signal strength. Signals that were too weak resulted in only a few memory cells that were not fit to survive or respond. By contrast, signals that were too strong led to terminally differentiated effectors (3) . This idea holds true on studies focused on T cell clones that respond to immunodominant epitopes or that bind with high affinity to cognate antigens. In these studies, these high-affinity T cells are recruited in large frequencies to the memory pool, in part due to their greater expansion (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . However, in the context of infection or lymphopenia, even very low affinity antigens support memory development (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) . These data suggest that TCR affinity alone is not predictive of memory outcome. Indeed, other studies have found the duration or t1/2 of the pMHC-TCR interaction (both equilibrium and aggregate half-life) can serve as a better predictor of memory fate (14, 15) . Thus, recent work has shown that Th1 memory fate correlates with long TCR-pMHC t1/2 times and not with the affinity of the pMHC-TCR interaction or the ability to expand (16) . The relationship between TCR-pMHC I dwell time and CD8 T cell memory commitment is currently less clear. It is most likely distinct from CD4 T cells, especially when considering the different contributions of CD4 and CD8 co-receptors to the stability of the TCR-pMHC interaction and the narrower range of effector functions for CD8 T cells (17, 18) . The timing and availability of the antigen is also important for making the memory \"choice. \" One report has suggested that earlysustained T cell-APC interactions were absolutely required for the response of memory cells (but dispensable for the acquisition of effector function), although a clear effect in memory generation was not provided (19) . By contrast, other reports have shown that shortening TCR stimulation early or late in the response favors the generation of memory T cells (20) (21) (22) (23) . Collectively, these studies illustrate that a strict quantitative model of TCR signaling cannot easily explain T cell memory commitment/function and suggest that the efficiency of an antigen to assemble the TCR signals that specifically support memory may be more complex than originally anticipated.An alternative to the quantitative model of TCR signaling for memory is a model that considers the quality of TCR signaling. In other words, the TCR signals that support the development of memory may be qualitatively different from the ones required for other T cell functions (effector function or proliferation). TCR signal quality could be determined by the strength of the TCR signal. In this line, Jenkins and colleagues recently showed how differences in antigen dose/aggregate p-MHCII dwell time can lead to different CD4 T cell lineage choices. They posit a model where a low amount of TCR signaling supports Tfh development, an intermediate amount induces Th1, and large amounts of TCR signaling enables GC-Tfh differentiation (15, 24) . For CD8 T cells, a decreasing potential model has been proposed where the weaker the signal a T cell receives (over a certain threshold), the higher the likelihood of the cell to enter in the memory pool (25, 26) . This model does not distinguish between antigenic or inflammatory signals nor does it take into account the input of signals from the local tissue environment in determining the phenotypic diversity of the memory pool. However, it is consistent with the fact that very weak TCR signals (even in the range of self) are sufficient to support the memory program (10, 12) .In light of this, it is possible that different T cell outcomes are achieved at different TCR signaling thresholds. This is not a novel concept [reviewed in Ref. (27, 28) ]. Seminal work by Valittutti and Lanzavechia originally determined that proliferation required higher antigen doses than IFN\u03b3 secretion or cytotoxicity in human T cell clones (29). In vivo, it has also been reported that CD8 T cell proliferation requires longer and higher affinity TCR-pMHC interactions than what is required for the acquisition of effector function or memory differentiation (10, 30) . Thus, memory fate may be supported by low-grade TCR signals, which are sufficient for the acquisition of memory programing but are not strong or continuous enough to \"burn the differentiating T cell to death. \" Consistent with this, T cells favor the expression of memoryassociated transcription factors (23) and preferentially develop into protective memory T cells in the context of very weak TCR signals (10, 13, 23) . These, together with the fact that memory precursors can be detected early in the immune response raises the hypothesis that memory development may be a default pathway whose TCR signaling threshold is lower than the threshold required for full expansion or to become short-lived effector (26, 31). T cells survival capacity may be established depending on the signals that the individual T cell clones continue to experience during the course of an immune response. That is, T cells exposed to strong or continued signals become short-lived effectors destined to die (32), whereas T cells receiving slightly weaker signals are directed into the T EM phenotype. This fosters the intriguing idea that very early in the response a set of T cells are directed down the memory path, perhaps, to ensure diversity within the memory pool (33, 34).Given that T cells can give rise to a battery of daughter cells of very different phenotypes and fates; most likely, T cells are not predetermined to acquire a specific outcome at the na\u00efve level (35-37). Therefore, qualitatively different biochemical input must determine each of the fates a T cell can adopt during an immune response. These qualitatively different biochemical signals may be defined early in the response or progressively, by a combination of factors that act at the same time, or in a multistage process. It is clear that inflammation and tissue-specific signals shape the phenotypic determination of T effector and memory cells; yet, experimental evidence still indicates that TCR signals, by themselves, are key at inducing memory programs and enabling the T cells ability to receive the extrinsic signals that help to determine the diversity of T cell fates (1, 23, 24, 38) . In this scenario, TCR signal quality may be defined independently of the quantity of the TCR signal and dictated by the singular ability of the antigen to efficiently assemble a \"signalosome\" for memory fate that is distinct from the one required for other T cell functions (discussed in detail below). This is supported by studies where a point mutation in one of the constant domains of the TCR allows for expansion and acquisition of effector function but severely impairs CD8 memory development (39). In this model, the properties of the TCR-pMHC interactions are intact, affinity and dwell time are not compromised. Furthermore, there is not an overall reduction in TCR signaling but rather a defect only in the activation of TCR-dependent NF\u03baB signaling (39). Thus, TCR signaling to memory may be defined by the ability of the antigen to induce the activation of specific signaling pathways key to launch the memory program. In agreement with this, specific inhibition of other signaling pathways, such as Wnt, mTOR, or NF\u03baB, affects T cell memory fate decisions very differently (39-41).", "citance": "One report has suggested that earlysustained T cell-APC interactions were absolutely required for the response of memory cells (but dispensable for the acquisition of effector function), although a clear effect in memory generation was not provided (19) .", "claims": [{"text": "Early sustained T cell- APC interactions are required for response of memory cells.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 195844599, "title": "High-content screen in human pluripotent cells identifies miRNA-regulated pathways controlling pluripotency and differentiation", "abstract": "BACKGROUND By post-transcriptionally regulating multiple target transcripts, microRNAs (miRNAs or miR) play important biological functions. H1 embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and NTera-2 embryonal carcinoma cells (ECCs) are two of the most widely used human pluripotent model cell lines, sharing several characteristics, including the expression of miRNAs associated to the pluripotent state or with differentiation. However, how each of these miRNAs functionally impacts the biological properties of these cells has not been systematically evaluated.   METHODS We investigated the effects of 31 miRNAs on NTera-2 and H1 hESCs, by transfecting miRNA mimics. Following 3-4 days of culture, cells were stained for the pluripotency marker OCT4 and the G2 cell-cycle marker Cyclin B1, and nuclei and cytoplasm were co-stained with Hoechst and Cell Mask Blue, respectively. By using automated quantitative fluorescence microscopy (i.e., high-content screening (HCS)), we obtained several morphological and marker intensity measurements, in both cell compartments, allowing the generation of a multiparametric miR-induced phenotypic profile describing changes related to proliferation, cell cycle, pluripotency, and differentiation.   RESULTS Despite the overall similarities between both cell types, some miRNAs elicited cell-specific effects, while some related miRNAs induced contrasting effects in the same cell. By identifying transcripts predicted to be commonly targeted by miRNAs inducing similar effects (profiles grouped by hierarchical clustering), we were able to uncover potentially modulated signaling pathways and biological processes, likely mediating the effects of the microRNAs on the distinct groups identified. Specifically, we show that miR-363 contributes to pluripotency maintenance, at least in part, by targeting NOTCH1 and PSEN1 and inhibiting Notch-induced differentiation, a mechanism that could be implicated in na\u00efve and primed pluripotent states.   CONCLUSIONS We present the first multiparametric high-content microRNA functional screening in human pluripotent cells. Integration of this type of data with similar data obtained from siRNA screenings (using the same HCS assay) could provide a large-scale functional approach to identify and validate microRNA-mediated regulatory mechanisms controlling pluripotency and differentiation.", "citation_paragraph": "While the pro-pluripotency roles of miR-302 and miR-294 were expected, since they are enriched in pluripotent cells and are repressed during differentiation, the propluripotency role of miR-181 family members is more intriguing. While Stadler et al. [10] found these miRs to be induced during differentiation of hESCs (miR-181b and d) and NT2 cells (miR-181a and b), we found that miR181d-5p considerably increased OCT4 nuclear levels and cell counts, also reducing cell and nucleus size, in both our screenings. Importantly, ESCC miR mimics from miR-302 and miR-290 clusters and from the miR-181 family all promote the initiation phase during OSK-mediated reprogramming of MEFs into iPSCs [69] [70] [71] , in line with their pro-pluripotency roles. In mESCs, miR-181 family members are transcribed from three distinct clusters, differentially bound by Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, and TCF3 TFs, and expressed in pluripotent and differentiated cells. While miR-181a-1~181b-2 cluster is bound by all these TFs and expressed in neural precursors and MEFs, miR181c~181d cluster is bound by all TFs except TCF3 and is expressed only in mESCs; finally, cluster miR-181a-2~181b-1 (in chr1) is expressed only in neural precursors and is not bound by any of these TFs [24] . Interestingly, the differential regulation of these clusters by TCF3 during reprogramming could be implicated in the stage-specific regulation of reprogramming by Tcf3, promoting it in the early phase, while inhibiting in the later stages [72] .MiRs from the miR-181 family are also induced during mESC differentiation, targeting Cbx7, the primary Polycomb ortholog of Polycomb repressive complexes 1 (PRC1) which reads repressive H3K27me3 histone marks left by PRC2, leading to derepression of bivalent genes encoding lineage-specific TFs and markers [2, [73] [74] [75] . In contrast, ectopic expression of Cbx7 in mESC enhances self-renewal and inhibits differentiation and X chromosome inactivation; in turn, upon its knockdown, mESC colonies display a flattened morphology [73] , characteristics related to the na\u00efve or primed states, respectively. Thus, similar to the miR-302 family, although miR-181 family possesses pluripotency-related properties, it may be associated with the transition to the primed state, by targeting Cbx7.In addition to miR-181d-5p, miR-145-5p and miR-222-3p were also induced in pluripotent cells upon differentiation [10] and similarly found to considerably enhance OCT4 nuclear levels in both our screenings (increasing cell counts and reducing cell and nucleus sizes). For miR-145-5p, our results were particularly unexpected, as this miR was shown to target OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4, negatively regulating their translation during cell differentiation [76] . Moreover, the inhibition of this miR during reprogramming was shown to increase the efficiency of iPSC generation [77] . These conflicting findings may result from differences between the transient effect mediated by transfection of mimics, as compared to the sustained and strong expression mediated by lentiviral vectors. In fact, contrasting findings arising from different methods used were previously pointed out by our group in the study of the miR-29 family. Using transfection of synthetic miRs or inhibitors, our group and others showed that miR-29a hampers reprogramming by different mechanisms, including activation of WNT/beta-catenin signaling (by targeting GSK3B) and targeting of active DNA demethylation enzymes of the TET family [71, 78, 79] . Strikingly in contrast, expression of miR-29 throughout the process using a retroviral vector promotes reprogramming, an effect resulting from passive global demethylation following constitutive knockdown of the targets Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b [80] . However, transient reduction of DNMT3a/b by siRNAs does not affect reprogramming [81] .Many effects of miRs (such as ESCC miRs) on pluripotency and reprogramming have been attributed to their function in the regulation of key cell cycle regulators [20, 61, [82] [83] [84] . In fact, while induction of cell proliferation increases reprogramming efficiency, cell-cycle arrest inhibits it [85] . Thus, many miRs physiologically associated with differentiation of ESCs may promote reprogramming and pluripotency in vitro, trough cell cycle-mediated effects.", "citance": "In contrast, ectopic expression of Cbx7 in mESC enhances self-renewal and inhibits differentiation and X chromosome inactivation; in turn, upon its knockdown, mESC colonies display a flattened morphology [73] , characteristics related to the na\u00efve or primed states, respectively.", "claims": [{"text": "Ectopic expression of Cbx7 in mESC encourages differentiation  in neural precursors.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Ectopic expression of Cbx7 in mESC enhances self-renewal in neural precursors.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Ectopic expression of Cbx7 in mESC facilitates X chromosome activation.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Ectopic expression of Cbx7 in mESC inhibits X chromosome activation.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Ectopic expression of Cbx7 in mESC inhibits differentiation  in neural precursors.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Ectopic expression of Cbx7 in mESC inhibits self-renewal in neural precursors.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}

Herein, we investigated the mechanism of SALL4 re-expression in HBV-related HCCs. We performed bisulfite sequencing PCR of genomic DNA isolated from HBV-related HCCs and HBV replicating cells, and examined DNA methylation of a CpG island located downstream from SALL4 transcriptional start site (TSS). HBV-related HCCs expressing increased SALL4 exhibited demethylation of specific CpG sites downstream of SALL4 TSS. Similarly, SALL4 re-expression and demethylation of these CpGs was observed in HBV replicating cells. SALL4 is also re-expressed in poor prognosis HCCs of other etiologies. Indeed, increased SALL4 expression in hepatitis C virus-related HCCs correlated with demethylation of these CpG sites. To understand how CpG demethylation downstream of SALL4 TSS regulates SALL4 transcription, we quantified by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays RNA polymerase II occupancy of SALL4 gene, as a function of HBV replication. In absence of HBV replication, RNA polymerase II associated with SALL4 exon1. By contrast, in HBV replicating cells RNA polymerase II occupancy of all SALL4 exons increased, suggesting CpG demethylation downstream from SALL4 TSS influences SALL4 transcriptional elongation. Intriguingly, demethylated CpGs downstream from SALL4 TSS are within binding sites of octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4) and signal transducer and activator of transcription3 (STAT3). ChIP assays confirmed occupancy of these sites by OCT4 and STAT3 in HBV replicating cells, and sequential ChIP assays demonstrated co-occupancy with chromatin remodeling BRG1/Brahma-associated factors. BRG1 knockdown reduced SALL4 expression, whereas BRG1 overexpression increased SALL4 transcription in HBV replicating cells.

Here we define a fundamental function of Egr2 and 3 operating as a checkpoint that controls the transition between clonal expansion and differentiation of effector T cells. Egr2 and 3 deficiency resulted in defective clonal expansion but hyperactivation and excessive differentiation of T cells in response to viral infection. Conversely, sustained Egr2 expression enhanced expansion but severely impaired effector differentiation. Egr2 bound to and controlled the expression of genes regulating proliferation (Myc and Myb) and differentiation repressors (Bcl6, Id3), while repressing transcription factors required for effector function (Zeb2, RORa, RORc, and Bhlhe40). Egr2 and 3 expression in T cells was regulated reciprocally by antigen and IFN\u03b3, providing a mechanism for adjusting proliferation and differentiation of individual T cells. Thus, Egr2 and 3 are upstream regulators of effector CD4 and CD8 T cells that are essential for optimal responses with limited immunopathology.", "citation_paragraph": "The expansion and differentiation of T cells in response to infection are highly regulated by external signals, including inflammatory stimuli and the levels of antigens and cytokines (Kaech et al., 2002; Williams and Bevan, 2007; Kaech and Cui, 2012) , to achieve optimal adaptive immune responses (Stemberger et al., 2007; King et al., 2012; Tubo et al., 2013) . We have now found that Egr2 and 3, induced in response to antigen stimulation, are required for clonal expansion while potently inhibiting the differentiation of effector T cells. This temporal uncoupling of expansion and differentiation, mediated by Egr2 and 3, is essential for sufficient expansion of responding T cells and the control of pathology. We found that Egr2 and 3 expression is intricately regulated in a reciprocal fashion by antigen and inflammatory cytokines. The importance of proper regulation of Egr2 and 3 expression for adjusting expansion and differentiation is demonstrated by the reciprocal impairments in CD2-Egr2/3 \u2212/\u2212 and CD2-Egr2 T cells. The failure to clear the virus in both CD2-Egr2/3 \u2212/\u2212 and CD2-Egr2 transgenic mice, despite excessive effector differentiation in the former and enhanced proliferation in the latter, demonstrates the importance of optimal coupling of expansion and differentiation of T cells in response to viral infection. Egr2 and 3 have an overlapping function in the regulation of the homeostasis of B and T cells (Li et al., 2012) .

In contrast to their reported role in anergic T cells, we have demonstrated that Egr2 and 3 are required for clonal expansion of naive T cells in antiviral responses.

The main triggers of deriving of cell-free mitochondrial DNA are various clinical conditions associated with cell death, necrosis, and activation of cells following antigen stimulation, inflammatory cytokine effect. Currently cell-free mitochondrial DNA is discussed a critical activator of inflammation and the innate immune system that may link mitochondrial dysfunction, cell death and target organ damage. The epidemiological evidence indicates that elevated circulating cell-free mitochondrial DNA is associated with the initiation and development of CV and metabolic diseases, while diagnostic and predictive value of this biomarker among non-cancer individuals is not fully understood. The mini review is summarized evidences regarding the biological role of circulating cell-free mitochondrial DNA and hypothesized the indication for clinical use of circulating DNA as diagnostic and predictive biomarkers among patients with CV risk.", "citation_paragraph": "The epidemiological evidence indicates that alterations of mitochondrial DNA, including mutations and abnormal content of mitochondrial DNA, are associated with the initiation and development of CV and metabolic diseases. There is an association between leukocyte mitochondrial DNA content and a risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) [22] . Recent study has been shown that circulating cell-free mitochondrial DNA fragments were found the trigger of early endothelial dysfunction in the pre-diabetic patients at high CV risk [17] . Liu et al. [23] reported that circulating cell-free mitochondrial DNA was sufficiently higher in diabetics with CAD compared to those without CAD. Nevertheless, there was a significant correlation between cell-free mitochondrial DNA level and C-reactive protein concentration. Recent study has revealed that circulating cell-free DNA and their mitochondrial fragment might be used as indicators of cell death and tissue damage in percutaneous coronary artery intervention [24] . Therefore, cell-free DNA fragments are discussed a useful biomarker reflected cellular damage induced by exposure to chronic low-dose radiation within diagnostic procedures.Analyses of data obtained from two prospective observational cohort studies of the intensive care unit patients (the Brigham and Women's Hospital Registry of Critical Illness and Molecular Epidemiology of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) has shown that elevated cell-free mitochondrial DNA levels were associated with mortality and that an inclusion of this biomarker may improve a risk prediction in medical intensive care unit patients [25] . However, lack of results obtained from large clinical trials limits very well an interpretation of similar data. Taking into consideration that individualizing in the medical care is an important component of treatment strategy, use of biomarkers that could improve contemporary risk prediction scores appears to be attractive.Overall, cell-free mitochondrial DNA is currently suggested an important challenge in diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, in prediction of CV disease, pulmonary thromboembolism, in non-invasive early detection of atherosclerosis and understanding its pathological mechanism in vivo, in assessing various issues of treatment for atherosclerosis [26] [27] [28] [29] . Although cell-free mitochondrial DNA may be routinely used to accurately diagnose cancers, whether they could help to stratify non-cancer patients at CV risk is not clear.

{"s2orc_id": 3222222, "title": "Inhibition of food intake by PACAP in the hypothalamic ventromedial nuclei is mediated by NMDA receptors.", "abstract": "Central injections of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) into the ventromedial nuclei (VMN) of the hypothalamus produce hypophagia that is dependent upon the PAC1 receptor; however, the signaling downstream of this receptor in the VMN is unknown. Though PACAP signaling has many targets, this neuropeptide has been shown to influence glutamate signaling in several brain regions through mechanisms involving NMDA receptor potentiation via activation of the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases. With this in mind, we examined the Src-NMDA receptor signaling pathway as a target for PACAP signaling in the VMN that may mediate its effects on feeding behavior. Under nocturnal feeding conditions, NMDA receptor antagonism prior to PACAP administration into the VMN attenuated PACAP-mediated decreases in feeding suggesting that glutamatergic signaling via NMDA receptors is necessary for PACAP-induced hypophagia. Furthermore, PACAP administration into the VMN resulted in increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the GluN2B subunit of the NMDA receptor, and inhibition of Src kinase activity also blocked the effects of PACAP administration into the VMN on feeding behavior. These results indicate that PACAP neurotransmission in the VMN likely augments glutamate signaling by potentiating NMDA receptors activity through the tyrosine phosphorylation events mediated by the Src kinase family, and modulation of NMDA receptor activity by PACAP in the hypothalamus may be a primary mechanism for its regulation of food intake.", "citation_paragraph": "Hypothalamic glutamate neurotransmission is crucial to energy balance [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] , in part, through the regulation of feeding behavior [7] [8] [9] . This is in contrast to classical views of hypothalamic signaling that have focused on the importance of neuropeptides for homeostatic regulation. However, recent investigations into mechanisms of neuropeptide function have indicated that modulation of the fastacting amino acid neurotransmitters, glutamate and GABA, may be a primary role for neuropeptide signaling [10] . For example, the neuropeptides orexin and neuropeptide Y (NPY) both potently increase feeding behavior through glutamate receptor-dependent signaling pathways in the lateral hypothalamus [11, 12] and that orexin causes enhancement of presynaptic glutamate release and postsynaptic NMDA receptor activity in the ventral tegmental area [13] .The hypothalamic ventromedial nuclei (VMN) are critical regulators of body weight and possess both high levels of glutamate and all glutamate receptor subtypes [4, [14] [15] [16] . Stimulation of these nuclei produces reductions in food intake and increased metabolic rate [8, [17] [18] [19] [20] . Likewise, microinjection of the pleiotropic neuropeptide pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) into the VMN inhibits feeding behavior through activation of PAC1 receptors even after food deprivation [21, 22] , however, the VMN neuronal signaling downstream of PAC1R leading to decreased food intake is currently unknown. However, previous demonstration of synergy between PACAP and glutamate [23] [24] [25] in other brain regions suggests that PACAP-PAC1R signaling in the VMN may lead to augmented glutamate neurotransmission.Co-localization of PACAP and glutamate immunoreactivity in retinal ganglion cells, as well as in nerve terminals located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) support a mechanism of co-release at synapses of the retinohypothalamic tract [23, 26, 27] . Functionally, PACAP application to SCN slices produces dose-dependent phase shifts in circadian rhythms through modulation of NMDA receptor activity [24] . In another brain region, PACAP enhances NMDA receptor activity in the hippocampus, reportedly by two separate mechanisms involving Src tyrosine kinase signaling. The first of which involves cAMP/PKAdependent activation of Fyn, a member of the Src tyrosine kinase family, leading to phosphorylation of multiple tyrosine residues on the GluN2B subunit of the NMDA receptor [28] , while the second was shown to occur via PAC1R activation of a phospholipase C pathway leading to Src tyrosine kinase activation and augmented hippocampal NMDA receptor function [25] . Both PACAP-mediated signaling pathways reported in the hippocampus suggest that modulation of NMDA receptors can occur through Src family kinase activity, which has been implicated in the regulation of feeding behavior by lateral hypothalamic neurons [29] .In order to determine whether modulation of glutamatergic NMDA receptor signaling underlies the regulation of feeding behavior by PACAP in the hypothalamus we measured nocturnal food intake following pharmacological inhibition of NMDA receptor function within the VMN prior to PACAP injection. Moreover, we analyzed tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDA receptors following PACAP administration and examined whether activity of Src family kinases is important for PACAP-mediated alterations of feeding behavior in the VMN. Our results suggest that NMDA receptor activity is necessary for PACAP-granted for this version to appear in e-Publications@Marquette.

{"s2orc_id": 10579265, "title": "Chemokines and chemokine receptors: positioning cells for host defense and immunity.", "abstract": "Chemokines are chemotactic cytokines that control the migratory patterns and positioning of all immune cells. Although chemokines were initially appreciated as important mediators of acute inflammation, we now know that this complex system of approximately 50 endogenous chemokine ligands and 20 G protein-coupled seven-transmembrane signaling receptors is also critical for the generation of primary and secondary adaptive cellular and humoral immune responses. Recent studies demonstrate important roles for the chemokine system in the priming of naive T cells, in cell fate decisions such as effector and memory cell differentiation, and in regulatory T cell function. In this review, we focus on recent advances in understanding how the chemokine system orchestrates immune cell migration and positioning at the organismic level in homeostasis, in acute inflammation, and during the generation and regulation of adoptive primary and secondary immune responses in the lymphoid system and peripheral nonlymphoid tissue.", "citation_paragraph": "Although T CM preferentially migrate through the blood and SLOs, where they are positioned to respond quickly to pathogens that access and replicate within the LN, other memory subsets are classified on the basis of their migration properties within nonlymphoid tissue (Figure 4) . Effector memory T cells (T EM ) are characterized by the lack of LN-homing CD62L and CCR7 expression and the lack of tissue retention molecules, such as CD103 and CD69. These cells therefore preferentially migrate between the blood and spleen compartments and enter peripheral organs, such as the lung, liver, intestinal tract, and kidney (191, 192) . However, they may also have access to peripheral LNs via CD62L-independent mechanisms, including CD62P and CXCR3 during inflammation and \u03b14\u03b21 and E-selectin in the resting state (160, 206, 207) . Compared with T CM , T EM proliferate less and are skewed toward greater production of effector cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 (203) . Thus, these cells have been hypothesized as functioning to survey the peripheral tissue and enact a quick effector response to tissue infection.More recently, another subset of long-lived memory cells, termed resident-memory T cells (T RM ), has been defined by their preferential tissue residence. As recently reviewed, these cells have been definitively identified in the skin, vaginal mucosa, central nervous system, salivary gland, lung, and intestine and are characterized by the increased expression of CD103 and CD69 and a lack of CD62L and CCR7 (208) . Interestingly, recent studies have demonstrated the importance of chemokines in the development and maintenance of CD8 + T RM . For example, the development of CD8 + T RM in the skin during HSV infection is dependent upon localization of CD8 + T RM precursors to the epidermis by CXCR3-CXCL10 interactions, which counteract a CCR7-dependent tissue exit signal (209) . Further, CD8+ T RM are maintained in the tissue by downregulation of S1P1 (210) . It should be noted that within most of these tissues, CD4+ and CD8 + memory T cells localize to distinct compartments. For example, in the skin, a slow-moving population of CD8 + T cells patrols the epidermis and hair follicles, whereas CD4+ memory T cells traffic more rapidly through the dermis and then back into the circulation (211, 212) . These recirculating memory T cells (T RCM ) appear to have a phenotype distinct from T CM , T EM , or T RM , with CCR7 int-pos , CD62L int , CD103 +/\u2212 , CD69 \u2212 , CCR4 +/\u2212 , and E-selectin + expression, which may suggest that they represent a distinct memory cell subset (213) . In any case, T RM appear uniquely positioned in the peripheral tissue to quickly enact effector functions and provide protection from reinfection or reactivation of latent virus (214, 215) . Exactly how T RM mediate their protective response has not been fully elucidated, but recent data have suggested that a key function of these cells is their rapid and robust expression of chemokines. In the lung, for instance, influenza-specific memory CD4+ T cells can greatly enhance the early production of inflammatory chemokines, such as CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL2, and CXCL1, upon heterologous viral challenge, resulting in reduced titers and improved viral control (216) . In the female reproductive tract, CD8+ T RM quickly produce IFN-\u03b3 in response to cognate antigen. This results in robust local production of chemokines, such as CXCL9, which recruits circulating memory CD8+ T cells independent of their antigen specificity (217). Thus, a major function of both CD4+ and CD8 + T RM may be the rapid and robust local production of chemokines in mucosal tissues upon the recognition of previously encountered antigen. Such chemokine production would then recruit circulating memory T cells, newly activated effector T cells, or other leukocyte subsets, such as monocytes, neutrophils, and NK cells, for enhanced protection to rechallenge with the same or heterologous viruses.", "citance": "In the lung, for instance, influenza-specific memory CD4+ T cells can greatly enhance the early production of inflammatory chemokines, such as CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL2, and CXCL1, upon heterologous viral challenge, resulting in reduced titers and improved viral control (216) .", "claims": [{"text": "Enhanced early production of inflammatory chemokines damages viral control in the lung.", "subject": "Inflammatory chemokines", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Enhanced early production of inflammatory chemokines improves viral control in the lung.", "subject": "Inflammatory chemokines", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Upon viral challenge, influenza-specific memory CD4+ T cells greatly diminish the early production of inflammatory chemokines in the lung.", "subject": "Influenza-specific memory CD4+ T cells", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Upon viral challenge, influenza-specific memory CD4+ T cells greatly enhance the early production of inflammatory chemokines in the lung.

{"s2orc_id": 197674500, "title": "Tebentafusp: T Cell Redirection for the Treatment of Metastatic Uveal Melanoma", "abstract": "Metastatic disease from uveal melanoma occurs in almost 50% of patients suffering from this ocular tumour, with median survival from development of symptoms being around 1 year. In contrast to cutaneous melanoma, kinase inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors are usually ineffective in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma. Tebentafusp is a novel form of immunotherapy based on the immune-mobilising monoclonal T cell receptor against cancer (ImmTAC) platform, which comprises a soluble T cell receptor that is fused to an anti-CD3 single-chain variable fragment. The T cell receptor domain of tebentafusp targets cells present a human leukocyte antigen-A*02:01 complexed with a peptide derived from the melanoma-associated antigen gp100, which is expressed strongly by melanoma cells, weakly by normal melanocytes and minimally by other tissues. The anti-CD3 domain recruits CD3+ T cells (and, indirectly, other immune cells), redirecting these to the melanoma cells. The most common adverse events with tebentafusp are manageable and usually transient. Early survival data in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma are promising when considered alongside historical data. Based on these encouraging results, a randomised study comparing tebentafusp to investigator's choice of therapy in metastatic uveal melanoma is ongoing.", "citation_paragraph": "The first indication that stimulating the immune system can help fight cancer came in 1893, when Coley discovered that injecting a patient with dead bacteria could cause a fever that induced a tumour regression [43] .We now recognise immune evasion to be one of the hallmarks of cancer [44, 45] . Cancerous mutations can generate non-self neoantigens (non-native proteins), so that the cancer cells might be recognised and killed by cytotoxic T cells [46] ; however, T cell immunity to cancer neoantigens is frequently limited. This is because cancer neoantigens are often closely related to self-antigens and T cells that are reactive against self-antigens are deleted by thymic selection. This selection process, known as central tolerance, prevents self-reactive T cells from generating autoimmune diseases [47] . Some auto-reactive T cells escape the thymus and these are regulated by a number of peripheral tolerance mechanisms. For example, cytotoxic T cells are prevented from attacking normal cells by expressing deactivating (anergy-inducing) molecules, such as programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4). In addition, any T cells that recognise self-antigens are normally inhibited, inactivated, or deleted by 'tolerogenic' dendritic cells, which play a vital role in maintaining central and peripheral tolerance, either directly or via the generation and activation of regulatory T cells (known as Treg cells) [48] . Cytotoxic T cells are also then suppressed by Treg cells [49] .A cancer that is clinically detectable has, by definition, evaded immune-mediated destruction. T cell eradication of cancer cells displaying high numbers of neoantigens creates a selection pressure for cells displaying fewer neoantigens (i.e., 'immunoediting') [50] . Furthermore, malignant tumours can create an immunosuppressive environment, for example, by expressing programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) to downregulate the activity of cytotoxic T cells, as well as attracting Treg cells and secreting immunosuppressive cytokines [51] .Immunotherapy aims to circumvent immune evasion by tumour cells and to induce immune-mediated tumour cell death. One of the earliest forms of immunotherapy deployed interleukin (IL)-2 [52] , a T cell growth factor that stimulates expansion of cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells [53] . IL-2 is an effective therapy for metastatic melanoma and metastatic renal cell carcinoma, which has been approved for use in both cancers [52] . More recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors have been developed, which block PD-L1 (e.g., durvalumab, atezolizumab), PD-1 (e.g., pembrolizumab, nivolumab), or CTLA-4 (e.g., ipilimumab), thereby preventing the suppression of cytotoxic T cells [54] . These have proved highly effective in the treatment of CM and other cancers [55] . The success of these inhibitors in a number of tumour types has led to a search for novel checkpoints-T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT) [56] , T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-3 (TIM-3) [57] and lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3) [58] , which appear to be promising therapeutic targets.Other innovative approaches include a variety of adoptive T cell therapies, such as those using tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) [59] , engineered T cell receptors (TCRs) [60] and chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) on T cells [61] . While CAR T cell therapies have been approved for use in haematological malignancies [62, 63] , and TIL therapy has shown promise in mUM [59] , these forms of therapy are expensive and require a highly skilled team to prepare the tumour-specific cytotoxic T cells over several weeks [64] [65] [66] . Furthermore, enhancement of adoptive T cell therapy by immunodepletion and high-dose IL-2 therapy can cause severe complications [67] . Serious morbidity can also be caused by immune reactions against healthy tissues, the release of cytokines [68] , and (in the case of CAR T cell therapy) anaphylaxis against murine antigens [69] . Immune receptor agonists are another novel class of immunotherapies that promote signalling leading to immune-activation. These include CD122 agonists, which bind CD122 (the IL-2 receptor) and induce CD8+ T cell and natural killer cell expansion [70] ; OX-40 agonists, which provide costimulatory signals to CD4+ and CD8+ T cells [71] ; and glucocorticoid-induced tumour necrosis factor receptor family related gene (GITR) agonists, which reduce Treg-mediated immune suppression and activate CD8+ T cells [72] .UMs have a number of features that make them less amenable to current immunotherapies. Algazi et al. performed a meta-analysis focusing on patients with mUM receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors against PD-1 and PD-L1, and reported an objective response rate (ORR) of only 3.6% and a median progression-free survival (PFS) as short as 2.6 months [41] . These poor results were confirmed by a meta-analysis by Khoja et al., which showed a median PFS of 2.8 months in patients receiving immunotherapies [42] Among the potential biological explanations for this limited efficacy is the finding that UM has one of the lowest tumour mutational burden amongst all cancers, therefore, the neoantigen display is limited [14, 41, 73, 74] . This might explain why checkpoint inhibitors, when tested in patients with mUM, have shown little clinical benefit [41] . This is in contrast to CMs, which have a very high tumour mutational burden [73] and which show excellent responses to checkpoint inhibitors [75] . Additionally, PD-L1 expression has been shown to positively correlate with responses to anti-PD-(L)1 inhibitors [73, 76] . Compared to metastatic CM, mUM tissue samples show lower PD-L1 expression [77] , which might further account for the limited efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors in mUM. PD-L1 expression appears to be higher in primary UM than in liver lesions [78] , which could explain recent results showing promising efficacy for pembrolizumab in patients without bulky liver lesions [74] . However, as discussed previously, liver lesions are almost ubiquitous in mUM; therefore these data are compatible with the observed low response rate of checkpoint inhibitors in mUM. Overall, the low PD-L1 expression and low mutational burden in UM might explain the apparent lack of activity of checkpoint inhibitors in this tumour. Beyond checkpoint inhibition, Chandran et al. reported promising results in 2017 with autologous TIL and high-dose interleukin-2 in patients with mUM in a single-centre Phase II study; seven of 20 evaluable patients demonstrated objective tumour regression (35%; 95% CI: 16-59%), but this trial has since been terminated. [59] Van Loenen et al. have developed a T-cell receptor-modified T cells targeting preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma (PRAME) [60] and Forsberg et al. have developed CAR-T cells that eradicate uveal melanoma cells in animal models [61] ; however, to our knowledge no clinical results have yet been reported.", "citance": "Furthermore, enhancement of adoptive T cell therapy by immunodepletion and high-dose IL-2 therapy can cause severe complications [67] .", "claims": [{"text": "Enhancement of adoptive T cell therapy by immunodepletion and high-dose IL-2 therapy causes severe complications.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Enhancement of adoptive T cell therapy by immunodepletion and high-dose IL-2 therapy has no severe complications.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}
{"s2orc_id": 201124339, "title": "Exploring health literacy in relation to noncommunicable diseases in Samoa: a qualitative study", "abstract": "BACKGROUND Samoa is suffering from alarming rates of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). To address this epidemic, tackling health literacy is important. A qualitative study was conducted with the aim to explore health literacy in Samoa in relation to NCDs.   METHODS Six focus groups were conducted, with a total sample size of 73 participants aged over 18 years. The semi-structured interview guide was based on the conceptual model of the European Health Literacy project (HLS-EU). Data was translated, transcribed, coded, and categorized as part of the qualitative analysis.   RESULTS The analysis resulted in one overarching category and seven sub-categories based on 19 themes. It revealed that health literacy in Samoa is strongly influenced by the culture. Personal responsibility is lacking. The family circle is central to health in a community where support is provided through the church and local groupings. Basic knowledge of NCDs was present in the population, but a deeper understanding of chronic disease implications was lacking. Difficulties with regards to medication adherence for chronic diseases arose as a topic, and traditional healers are still strongly embedded in the local society. Finally, the health system's performance, especially primary care services at the local level, is suffering from the high burden of NCDs and has been challenged to respond to the needs of the community it serves.   CONCLUSION The findings of this study show how health literacy in Samoa is influenced by culture and suggest employing participatory, culture-sensitive, public health interventions which address the family as a whole, building on health literacy to address major public health problems like NCDs and remove barriers in the health system.", "citation_paragraph": "The aim of this study was to explore health literacy in Samoa in relation to NCDs. Limited research is available regarding health literacy in developing countries. The global burden of disease study from 2015 found that the epidemiological disease burden from NCDs is more prevalent in low economic settings [15] . In Samoa, NCDs are high among the major causes of premature mortality, but little is known about the health literacy of its population.The study helped to describe how health literacy is influenced by culture; particularly in Samoa, the family is a key pillar in terms of the management of illness. The patients depend on their family members as carers to help, teach and remind them about managing their own condition. Especially with chronic conditions such as NCDs, which demand a long-term care solution, this finding can support patients in addressing the struggles faced by the health care services to deal with the NCD epidemic. The Samoan society functions as a family, the \"Aiga\". Any health service facility operating in Samoa will have not only the patient waiting but their family members waiting together with them. The findings show the importance of culture and underline the significance of the recommendation of the researchers from the Ophelia studies to investigate specific health literacy needs in the local community [16] . As NCDs demand long term care solutions, it entails the individual to commit and comprehend the specific care required for them to proactively engage in the control of their own health [17] .The present study revealed the use of both traditional healers and official health services. Research on the utilization of certified health care services in low income countries pointed out the inter-relationship of people's perception with regards to effective treatment and their decision in terms of accepting or rejection the services available to them [18] . Once again, the results of this study confirmed the importance of culture in health. People participate in primary health care to the extent that they experience the service as offering reliable solutions to what they perceive as health problems, and this is exactly in line with the findings of this study. The decision of whether to use the services at the beginning of an illness, later, or even at all is calculated by weighing the anticipated benefits (relative to other alternatives) against the expected expenditure of time and money, and the personal abuse or friendliness of health workers that these efforts may entail. Understanding how people estimate factors on both sides of the equation relating costs to benefits is crucial to understanding the demand for primary health care services and, as a corollary, the strengths and failings of the programmes [19] . A Lancet Commission in 2014 published a paper on the importance of the role of culture in health, and it has shown how inseparable health is from the cultural perception of wellbeing [20] .Lack of human resources and medical supplies at the health facility and lack of financial resources were recurring major issues and recorded as a challenge in terms of health system performance. It is questionable what impact an intervention to address health literacy will have if financial hardship is one of the key barriers to accessing and seeking healthcare. It is also of importance to address broader societal determinants of health such as financial hardship and to ensure these basic values and rights are fulfilled as detailed in the recent call for Universal Health Coverage put forward by the Tokyo Declaration [21] . Samoa graduated from Least Developed Country to Developing Country in January 2014. This graduation shows an improvement at the macro-economic level, with anticipated annual growth of real GPD. In 2014, the United Nations estimated that Samoa would continue to further increase its human capital as measured by the Human Asset Index, experiencing improvements in child mortality, literacy and secondary school enrolment [22] .The study showed that a basic knowledge of NCD prevention is present, but it seems disconnected from a deeper understanding of the chronic impact of the diseases and their management. In terms of disease knowledge and awareness, chronic diseases such as NCDs might be perceived like any other disease, and therefore the implications of why people should go and see a doctor if they do not feel ill is misunderstood. The WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health stated that vulnerable groups are likely to suffer worse health outcomes, and the recent literature is now associating this with lower levels of health literacy [23] . Public health interventions focussing on the early detection and management of NCDs should embark on a broader understanding of how health literacy is influenced by culture.In the findings of this study, it became apparent that health care professionals are perceived as rude, and some crucial gaps were highlighted in the nurse/doctor-to-patient relationship. In attempts to understand why people in developing countries under-use health services, the uncongenial atmosphere in clinics and unfriendly service by clinicians have been documented in the ethnographic literature since the 1950s and 1960s [24] . The same barriers were identified in this study. In addition to the better-known issue that patients and doctors, the latter operating from a medical perspective, might not view illness and its treatment similarly, anthropologists have noted that the treatment clients receive is often abusive [25] . In Samoa, more research should be conducted into health care utilization and traditional beliefs and practices.In general, the results pointed out that in Samoa, people have a holistic view of health: a person is healthy when he or she is in tune with his/her environment and community. One's ability to cope with the environment/ community determines the state of wellness/health, and one's ability to cope is in turn strongly dependent on one's knowledge of culture. Being part of the traditional community and closely identifying with the culture of where one belongs is part of surviving skills to deal with unexpected events in life such as diseases. This knowledge allows a person to understand their place in the bigger scheme of things [26] . Therefore, effective interventions to promote the ability to cope with health challenges are clearly determined by the knowledge of the culture in Samoa.Applying the public health approach of health literacy suggests building a bottom-up, participatory, public health intervention that consists of three layers of health literacy: knowledge and skills regarding health information and health systems; social skills to enable interaction within the health system environment; and lastly, the critical ability to understand and apply the information received as relevant to one's own health [27] .The findings of this study detail novel Samoan results on how health literacy is influenced by culture and suggest that experts and policy makers should employ participatory, culture-sensitive, public health interventions to address major public health problems like NCDs by recognizing the strong role of families and local communities in health-related issues.To examine the trustworthiness of the study, Guba and Lincoln's validation criteria were applied detailing the credibility, transferability, confirmability and dependability of the qualitative study design used. [28, 29] . Findings from this study, which are based on accurate analysis of the opinions of the study participants, form the basis of credibility. Method triangulation was applied when CB and KS coded and analyzed the data independently. Additionally, persistent observation took place involving CB, KS and RM researchers constantly reading and rereading the data, analyzing, theorizing and revising the concepts accordingly.Regarding transferability, the data was studied until a conceptual idea emerged -in this case, that health literacy in Samoa is strongly influenced by the culture. By following the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research, thick descriptions of the themes and categories as well as a rich account of the participants and the research process were developed and outlined to enable others to assess whether the findings are representative of results in their own setting [30] . A gender bias should be noted as the majority of participants were women. The researchers took into account the complexity of the local setting and therefore followed a recruitment procedure in the villages through the local women's communities. Secondly, the focus groups were conducted during the daytime, which is the time that most men are working in the fields to ensure food can be provided for their families. The villages from the sample are all in rural settings, but it should be noted that most of the country is rural as Samoa has only one city, which mainly serves as an administrative hub and accommodates the upper/middle class.Dependability includes the aspect of consistency according to research standards. Furthermore, the study design was grounded in state-of-the-art knowledge of health literacy, with a specific conceptual focus derived from a validated European health literacy model. Finally, the principal investigator (CB) lived in Samoa at the time of the research and had obtained in-depth insights into local customs and traditions which were taken into account in the design and execution of the study. The third and fourth authors (RM, NdV) applied inquiry audit by reviewing the research process and data analysis made by the two initial coders (CB and KS).Conformability refers to inter-subjectivity: interpretation of the data should be based on the data, not on the personal preferences of the researchers involved. An audit trail of field notes, logbooks and analytical notes was kept throughout the research process to facilitate transparency. With regards to reflexivity, the role of researchers and non-participants can be mentioned. The presence of non-participants (Ministry of Health) may have influenced the discussion, although the trained facilitator briefed the non-participants on their observer status. Nevertheless, caution was taken to ensure an open and transparent dialogue during the focus groups based on the semi-structured interview guide.The inductive approach and the analysis applied, yielded the researchers to the emerging themes and categories. During the focus groups, themes became reappearing and saturation was achieved at the analytical level. Probably more categories would have appeared with an increased number of focus groups, however, with the data available the seven presented categories emerged as a result of the thorough data analysis.", "citance": "The global burden of disease study from 2015 found that the epidemiological disease burden from NCDs is more prevalent in low economic settings [15] .", "claims": [{"text": "Epidemiological disease burden from noncommunicable diseases is more prevalent in high economic settings.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Epidemiological disease burden from noncommunicable diseases is more prevalent in low economic settings.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 53944608, "title": "Studies in an Early Development Window Unveils a Severe HSC Defect in both Murine and Human Fanconi Anemia", "abstract": "Fanconi anemia (FA) causes bone marrow failure early during childhood, and recent studies indicate that a hematopoietic defect could begin in utero. We performed a unique kinetics study of hematopoiesis in Fancg-/- mouse embryos, between the early embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) to E12.5 developmental window (when the highest level of hematopoietic stem cells [HSC] amplification takes place) and E14.5. This study reveals a deep HSC defect with exhaustion of proliferative and self-renewal capacities very early during development, together with severe FA clinical and biological manifestations, which are mitigated at E14.5 due to compensatory mechanisms that help to ensure survival of Fancg-/- embryos. It also reports that a deep HSC defect is also observed during human FA development, and that human FA fetal liver (FL) HSCs present a transcriptome profile similar to that of mouse E12.5 Fancg-/- FL HSCs. Altogether, our results highlight that early mouse FL could represent a good alternative model for studying Fanconi pathology.", "citation_paragraph": "In the present paper, using a Fancg \u00c0/\u00c0 mouse model of FA we show that HSC defect starts very early during embryogenesis, during the earliest steps of hematopoietic amplification in FL and Pl. We also show that an HSC defect is also observed in the FL of a human FA (FANCB) fetus.The hypothesis that FA BMF could take its origin in utero was suggested by the study of Ceccaldi et al. (2012) and was corroborated by studies of fetal hematopoiesis in E14.5 Fancc \u00c0/\u00c0 and Fancd2 \u00c0/\u00c0 FL (Kamimae-Lanning et al.,2013; Suzuki et al., 2017; Yoon et al., 2016) . In the present work, we followed hematopoiesis in Fancg \u00c0/\u00c0 mice using state-of-the-art experimental hematopoiesis assays including long-term engraftment experiments on highly purified mouse and human cells. In an original way compared with previous studies, we focused on a crucial developmental window that spans from the onset of hematopoiesis in the AGM region at E11.5 until late HSC amplification in E14.5 FL, and also studied the Pl, which has been shown to be an important reservoir of HSCs during mouse development (Gekas et al., 2010; Ottersbach and Dzierzak, 2010) . We paid particular attention to E12.5 when amplification peaks, both in Pl and FL (Medvinsky et al., 2011) . Our study demonstrates that HSC impairment starts both in FL and Pl early during mouse development at E11.5, and is still present at E12.5 in these organs. In vivo transplantations revealed important quantitative and qualitative defect of Fancg \u00c0/\u00c0 E12.5 FL and Pl HSCs, and pointed out an exhaustion in their proliferative and self-renewal capacities, with a loss of hematopoietic lineage potential, especially myeloid. This applies also to Fancg \u00c0/\u00c0 FL LSA HSCs at E14.5, but to a lesser extent. Between E11.5 and E14.5 in the FL and between E11.5 and E12.5 in the Pl, HSCs are rapidly cycling, and therefore under high DNA replication stress, which could explain their compromised function in the Fancg \u00c0/\u00c0 context. Actually, although not significant, an elevation of gH2AX in the hematopoietic populations (especially HSCs) studied by flow cytometry was observed in E12.5 Fancg \u00c0/\u00c0 FL, indicative of a replication stress at this stage. Nevertheless, no increase in apoptosis, nor cell-cycle change, could be observed. Elevation of gH2AX was no longer detected in E14.5 FL. All these observations indicate that during Fancg \u00c0/\u00c0 embryonic development, HSC deficit is worse at E12.5 than at E14.5. Of note, external phenotypic signs of Fanconi disease such as smaller size, microphthalmia, or anophthalmia are also more pronounced early during development (E11.5-E12.5) and tend to attenuate around E14.5 (Figure 1) . Indeed, as development progresses, phenotypic features of Fancg \u00c0/\u00c0 embryos are more heterogeneous, some of them looking almost like WT embryos, including FL size (data not shown). Likewise, transcriptomic analysis also showed that in contrast to E12.5 FL, very few genes were significantly differentially expressed in E14.5 FL between Fancg \u00c0/\u00c0 and WT HSCs. One possible explanation is that Fancg \u00c0/\u00c0 embryos that are more deeply affected die around E14.5 (which could also explain the collapsed frequency of Fancg \u00c0/\u00c0 mice at birth) and that a compensatory amplification takes place when proliferative stress decreases, making transcriptomic differences between Fancg \u00c0/\u00c0 and WT HSCs less important, although functional defect remains. Actually, GSEA analysis of the transcriptome of E12.5 and E14.5 Fancg \u00c0/\u00c0 and WT FL HSCs is in agreement with a compensatory molecular regulation at E14.5, since BP downregulated at E12.5 are upregulated at E14.5, and vice versa ( Figure 6B ). Importantly, we also show that HSC function is also already impaired in utero in humans. During human development HSC amplification takes place in the FL, during the first and part of the second trimester. Our analysis of HSCenriched CD34 + CD38 \u00c0 CD45 + CD117 hi population from a 13 WG FANCB FL revealed both an important decrease in the frequency (55-fold) and functional activity (LTC-IC frequency) (4-fold) of this population compared with normal FL of matched stages of development. Interestingly, transcriptomic analysis showed that differentially up-and downregulated genes in HSCs from human FA were found to be involved in the very same BP as in HSCs from E12.5 Fancg \u00c0/\u00c0 FL, i.e., cell division, cell cycle, mRNA processing, and covalent chromatin modification for downregulated genes and GPCR pathway and olfactory signaling pathway for upregulated genes. This indicates that pathways dysregulated in fetal FA HSCs seem to be highly conserved between mouse and human during development.Most of the genes involved in cell-cycle regulation are downregulated in Fancg \u00c0/\u00c0 E12.5 FL, whether they are positive or negative regulators (Table S2 ). This dysregulation is also observed in human FA FL HSCs (Table S2 ). In line with the results described for Fancd2 \u00c0/\u00c0 E14.5 FL HSCs (Suzuki et al., 2017; Yoon et al., 2016) , p53 gene is significantly downregulated both in Fancg \u00c0/\u00c0 and FA fetal HSCs. In a genotoxic stress model, Milyavsky et al. (2010) showed that upon serial transplantations, HSCs submitted to g-irradiation with disabled p53 accumulated DNA damage and exhibited decreased self-renewal capacity. In the same way, during the replicative stress that occurs in the FL during embryonic development, the decrease in p53 signaling pathway in HSCs could lead to the defect in self-renewal that we observed during secondary transplants of BM from primary recipients injected with Fancg \u00c0/\u00c0 FL or Pl, even when BM cells injected presented a high CD45.2 chimerism. GSEA analysis also uncovered epigenetic dysregulations of E12.5 Fancg \u00c0/\u00c0 and human FA FL HSCs ( Figures 6B and   6D ), which could play an important role during the phases of high cell division and DNA replication that take place during embryogenesis. Epigenetic control is important to preserve normal homeostasis by regulating stem cell self-renewal versus differentiation in multiple tissue-specific stem cells (Beerman and Rossi, 2015) . An aberrant epigenetic control of gene expression-maintaining HSC compartment has been recently hypothesized to explain defective FA hematopoiesis (Brosh et al., 2017) , and our results during embryonic development are in line with this proposition. GPCR and olfactory signaling pathways were the main BP covering upregulated genes in Fancg \u00c0/\u00c0 and FA FL HSCs.Actually GPCRs contribute to hematopoietic regulation, these receptors being the direct link between HSCs and their microenvironment that hosts many hematopoietic regulators and neurotrophic factors (Ramkissoon et al., 2006) . The importance of the sympathetic system has been underlined not only for maintaining homeostasis of adult BM (Mendelson and Frenette, 2014) , but also in emergence of HSCs in mouse AGM (Fitch et al., 2012) . A recent report also demonstrates an olfactory control of blood progenitor maintenance in Drosophila (Shim et al., 2013) . Our unique kinetics study reveals that a deep HSCs defect is already present very early during Fancg \u00c0/\u00c0 mouse development, and that FA clinical and biological manifestations are more severe at early times of development (E11.5-E12.5), and are mitigated at E14.5. A deep HSC defect is also observed during human FA development, and human FA FL HSCs present a transcriptome profile similar to that of mouse E12.5 Fancg \u00c0/\u00c0 FL HSCs. Our model sheds light on the interest of positioning the study of Fanc knockout hematopoiesis earlier than E14.5, during the steps of highest HSC/HC amplification in the mouse embryo. Indeed, despite the fact that FL failure seems to go through different mechanisms than adult BM failure, it might represent a good alternative model to study hematopoietic failure and certainly presents important potential clinical relevance. (Koomen et al., 2002) were back-crossed on C57Bl6 background (n = 8). Fancg \u00c0/\u00c0 and WT embryos were produced by natural mating of C57Bl6/J Fancg heterozygote mice. Vaginal plugs were checked in the morning, marking E0.5. The stages of the embryos used were confirmed by somite counting and/or morphological analysis. Embryos were dissected further to recover placenta and liver. Embryo tails were genotyped using the Phire PCR Kit (Thermo Scientific).

Recent work highlights the potential of epigenetic modulating agents as tool to enhance anti-tumor immunity. The immune modulating effects of the combination of a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor and a histone deacetylase inhibitor in multiple myeloma is insufficiently characterized. Therefore, we used the murine immunocompetent 5T33MM model to investigate hallmarks of immunogenic cell death as well as alterations in the immune cell constitution in the bone marrow of diseased mice in response to the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor decitabine and the histone deacetylase inhibitor quisinostat. Vaccination of mice with 5T33 cells treated with epigenetic compounds delayed tumor development upon a subsequent tumor challenge. In vitro, epigenetic treatment induced ecto-calreticulin and CD47, as well as a type I interferon response. Moreover, treated 5T33vt cells triggered dendritic cell maturation. The combination of decitabine and quisinostat in vivo resulted in combinatory anti-myeloma effects. In vivo, epigenetic treatment increased tumoral ecto-calreticulin and decreased CD47 and PD-L1 expression, increased dendritic cell maturation and reduced CD11b positive cells. Moreover, epigenetic treatment induced a temporal increase in presence of CD8-positive and CD4-positive T cells with naive and memory-like phenotypes based on CD62L and CD44 expression levels, and reduced expression of exhaustion markers PD-1 and TIM3. In conclusion, a combination of a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor and a histone deacetylase inhibitor increased the immunogenicity of myeloma cells and altered the immune cell constitution in the bone marrow of myeloma-bearing mice.", "citation_paragraph": "A major hallmark of cancer is immune evasion which can occur at different levels of the immune response cycle. 1, 2 This includes the improper stimulation of dendritic cells (DCs) during tolerogenic cell death, the inefficient priming of naive T cells, absence or dysfunctionality of effector immune cells, improper antigen presentation by tumor cells and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. 3, 4 In multiple myeloma (MM), the immune system is compromised at multiple levels. MM cells express immunosuppressive cytokines and molecules such as IL6, IL10, TGF\u03b2, PD-L1, CD28, CD200 and ICOS-L which negatively influence DC and T cell function. Moreover, regulatory T cells, and (immature) myeloid cells inhibit effector anti-MM responses. 5, 6 Strategies are being developed to circumvent these immune escape mechanisms and include checkpoint inhibition, vaccination, adoptive T cell transfer and targeting of immunosuppressive populations. 7 Epigenetic modulating agents (EMAs) including DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) have been shown to modulate antitumor immune responses in various cancer models. [8] [9] [10] In MM patients, combining lenalidomide and the DNMTi azacytidine stimulated an adaptive immune response by inducing the expression of antigens. 11 DNMTi and HDACi induced MAGE-A3 expression in primary MM cells, thereby stimulating recognition by MAGE-A3 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). 12 The HDACi valproic acid induced natural killer (NK) ligands in MM cells and potentiated NK cell-mediated lysis. 13 We demonstrated that in vivo treatment of 5T33MM diseased mice with the HDACi quisinostat (Quis) and the DNMTi decitabine (DAC) results in the upregulation of genes involved in immune regulation. 14 Mechanistically, it Chiappinelli et al. demonstrated that DNMTi induce a type I interferon (IFN) response due to viral mimicry. 15 Moreover, enhanced anti-tumor immunity by combining DNMTi with HDACi involves type I IFN, MYC depletion and profound alterations in the tumor microenvironment. 9, 10 To our knowledge, pre-clinical work on the immune modulating effects of combining DNMTi and HDACi in MM is limited. In this study, we report on the immunomodulatory effects mediated by DNMTi and HDACi in the 5T33MM immunocompetent murine model for MM. Here, we studied hallmarks of immunogenic cell death (ICD) in addition to the immune cell constitution in the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. ICD is a regulated form of cell death that is correlated with exposure and release of danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) including cell-surface calreticulin, HMGB1, type I IFN, ANXA1 and ATP which are known to stimulate adaptive immune responses. 16 Therefore, the presence of DAMPs and associated components of an anti-myeloma immune response are interesting to study in the context of DNMTi and HDACi.", "citance": "[8] [9] [10] In MM patients, combining lenalidomide and the DNMTi azacytidine stimulated an adaptive immune response by inducing the expression of antigens.", "claims": [{"text": "Epigenetic modulating agents (EMAs) modulate antitumor immune response in a cancer model system.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

This ensures the maintenance of skills and addresses any limitations related to professional accountability (Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) 2004a).One of the risks associated with the peripheral IV route, as with other routes, is calculation of medicine doses. This requires educational support to enable staff competence (Hutton 1998 , LUHD 2003a . NMC (2004b) guidance on the administration of medicines specifies that two staff members are required where there are complex calculations, and that both practitioners need to calculate independently. Upton (2001) states that two registered practitioners are required throughout the IV drug administration procedure to participate in calculating, checking the prescription, selecting, dispensing, preparing, and administering the medicine as well as recording the procedure. This minimises the risk of medicine calculation or practice error. However, some organisations may consider single nurse administration acceptable.Research suggests that common errors in drug administration include poor handwriting of prescriptions, staff failing to follow policy and poor communication (Cooper 1995 , Williams 1996 , Upton 2001 .

A chief contributor to this barrier is the impact on microbial processes and energy metabolism of lignocellulose-derived inhibitors, including phenolic carboxylates, phenolic amides (for ammonia-pretreated biomass), phenolic aldehydes, and furfurals. To understand the bacterial pathways induced by inhibitors present in ammonia-pretreated biomass hydrolysates, which are less well studied than acid-pretreated biomass hydrolysates, we developed and exploited synthetic mimics of ammonia-pretreated corn stover hydrolysate (ACSH). To determine regulatory responses to the inhibitors normally present in ACSH, we measured transcript and protein levels in an Escherichia coli ethanologen using RNA-seq and quantitative proteomics during fermentation to ethanol of synthetic hydrolysates containing or lacking the inhibitors. Our study identified four major regulators mediating these responses, the MarA/SoxS/Rob network, AaeR, FrmR, and YqhC. Induction of these regulons was correlated with a reduced rate of ethanol production, buildup of pyruvate, depletion of ATP and NAD(P)H, and an inhibition of xylose conversion. The aromatic aldehyde inhibitor 5-hydroxymethylfurfural appeared to be reduced to its alcohol form by the ethanologen during fermentation, whereas phenolic acid and amide inhibitors were not metabolized. Together, our findings establish that the major regulatory responses to lignocellulose-derived inhibitors are mediated by transcriptional rather than translational regulators, suggest that energy consumed for inhibitor efflux and detoxification may limit biofuel production, and identify a network of regulators for future synthetic biology efforts.", "citation_paragraph": "Elucidation of metabolic and regulatory barriers in microbial conversion of lignocellulosic sugars to ethanol is crucial for both the immediate goal of economical cellulosic ethanol and for the long-term development of next-generation biofuels and sustainable chemicals from renewable biomass. Efficient conversion of lignocellulose (LC) hydrolysates is limited by multiple factors (Mills et al., 2009; Lau and Dale, 2010) , including high osmolarity (Underwood et al., 2004; Purvis et al., 2005; Miller and Ingram, 2007) , toxicity of the conversion products (Ingram and Buttke, 1984) , and inhibitors of microbial metabolism and growth generated during the deconstruction of LC (Zaldivar et al., 1999; Wang et al., 2011a; Tang et al., submitted) . Understanding and overcoming the barriers created by LC-derived inhibitors presents significant challenges as their composition can vary depending on the biomass source of LC, the methods used to deconstruct the LC, and the diverse metabolic and regulatory responses of microbes to inhibitors (Klinke et al., 2004; Liu, 2011) . Synergy among the inhibitors, the high osmolarity inherent to hydrolysates, and toxicity of conversion products (e.g., ethanol) are additional factors that contribute to the complex molecular landscape of lignocellulosic hydrolysates (Klinke et al., 2004; Liu, 2011; Piotrowski et al., 2014) .Release of sugars from LC typically requires either acidic or alkaline treatment of biomass prior to or coupled with chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis (Chundawat et al., 2011) . Acidic treatments generate significant microbial inhibitors by condensation reactions of sugars (e.g., furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural). Microbes typically detoxify these aldehydes by reduction or oxidation to less toxic alcohols or acids (Booth et al., 2003; Herring and Blattner, 2004; Marx et al., 2004; Jarboe, 2011) , but these conversions also directly or indirectly consume energy that otherwise would be available for biofuel synthesis (Miller et al., 2009a,b) The impact of these inhibitors is especially significant for C5 sugars like xylose whose catabolism provide slightly less cellular energy (Lawford and Rousseau, 1995) , and can be partially ameliorated by replacing NADPH-consuming enzymes with NADH-consuming enzymes (Wang et al., 2013) .Alkaline treatments, for instance with ammonia, are potentially advantageous in generating fewer toxic aldehydes, but the spectrum of inhibitors generated by alkaline treatments is less well characterized and their effects on microbial metabolism are less well understood. We have developed an approach to elucidate the metabolic and regulatory barriers to microbial conversion in LC hydrolysates using ammonia fiber expansion (AFEX) of corn stover, enzymatic hydrolysis, and a model ethanologen (GLBRCE1) engineered from the well-studied bacterium E. coli K-12 (Schwalbach et al., 2012) . Our strategy is to compare anaerobic metabolic and regulatory responses of the ethanologen in authentic AFEX-pretreated corn stover hydrolysate (ACSH) to responses to synthetic hydrolysates (SynHs) designed to mimic ACSH with a chemically defined medium. GLBRCE1 metabolizes ACSH in exponential, transition, and stationary phases but, unlike growth in traditional rich media (Sezonov et al., 2007) , GLBRCE1 enters stationary phase (ceases growth) long before depletion of available glucose but coincident with exhaustion of amino acid sources of organic nitrogen (Schwalbach et al., 2012) . The growth-arrested cells remain metabolically active and convert the remaining glucose, but not xylose, into ethanol (Schwalbach et al., 2012) .Our first version of SynH (SynH1) matched ACSH for levels of glucose, xylose, amino acids, and some inorganics, overall osmolality, and the amino-acid-dependent growth arrest of GLBRCE1 (Schwalbach et al., 2012) . However, gene expression profiling revealed that SynH1 cells experienced significant osmotic stress relative to ACSH cells, whereas ACSH cells exhibited elevated expression of efflux pumps, notably of aaeAB that acts on aromatic carboxylates (Van Dyk et al., 2004) , relative to SynH1 cells (Schwalbach et al., 2012) . Osmolytes found in ACSH (betaine, choline, and carnitine) likely explained the lower osmotic stress, whereas phenolic carboxylates derived from LC (e.g., coumarate and ferulate) likely explained efflux pump induction possibly via the AaeR and MarA/SoxS/Rob regulons known to be induced by phenolic carboxylates (Sulavik et al., 1995; Dalrymple and Swadling, 1997) . We also observed elevated expression of psp, ibp, and srl genes associated with ethanol stress at ethanol concentrations three-fold lower than previously reported to induce expression (Yomano et al., 1998; Goodarzi et al., 2010) and thus consistent with a synergistic stress response with the LC-derived inhibitors. These findings led us to hypothesize that the collective effects of osmotic, ethanol, and LC-derived inhibitor stresses created an increased need for ATP and reducing equivalents that was partially offset in early growth phase by catabolism of amino acids, as N and possibly S sources. However, as these amino acids are depleted, cells transition to stationary phase where they continue to catabolize glucose for maintenance ATP and NAD(P)H but are unable to generate sufficient energy for cell growth or efficient xylose catabolism.To test this hypothesis, we developed a new SynH formulation (SynH2) that faithfully replicates the physiological responses in ACSH and the effects of LC-derived inhibitors. Using SynH2 with and without the LC-derived inhibitors, we generated and analyzed metabolomic, gene expression, and proteomic data to define the effects of inhibitors on bacterial gene expression and physiology. The analysis allowed identification of key regulators that may provoke stress responses in the presence of LC-derived inhibitors and suggest that coping mechanisms employed by E. coli to deal with lignocellulosic stress drains cellular energy, thus limiting xylose conversion.", "citance": "We also observed elevated expression of psp, ibp, and srl genes associated with ethanol stress at ethanol concentrations three-fold lower than previously reported to induce expression (Yomano et al., 1998; Goodarzi et al., 2010) and thus consistent with a synergistic stress response with the LC-derived inhibitors.", "claims": [{"text": "Ethanol stress decreases the expression of IBP in bacteria.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Ethanol stress increases the expression of IBP in bacteria.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Ethanol stress increases the expression of PSP in bacteria.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Ethanol stress increases the expression of SRL in bacteria.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Ethanol stress lowers the expression of PSP in bacteria.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Ethanol stress reduces the expression of SRL in bacteria.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}

In the present study, we aimed at exploring the association between total gestational weight gain (GWG) and PE. Methods We performed a population-based cohort survey of 98,820 women with singleton pregnancies who delivered in Slovenia from 2013 to 2017. Aggregated data were obtained from the National Perinatal Information System (NPIS). The main outcome measure was the incidence of PE. The main exposure variable was total GWG standardized for the gestational duration by calculating the z-scores. The associations between total GWG and PE stratified by pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) categories adjusted for a variety of covariates were determined using multivariable logistic regression. We calculated the crude odds ratio (OR) and adjusted odds ratio (aOR) with a 95% confidence interval using a two-way test. Results Excessive GWG was associated with increased odds of PE in all pre-pregnancy BMI categories. The increase in the odds of PE by 445% was the highest in underweight women and by 122% was the lowest in obese women. Low GWG was associated with decreased odds of PE in all pre-pregnancy BMI categories except in normal-weight women with a GWG below \u22122 standard deviation (SD) and underweight women. The decrease in the odds of PE by 67% was the highest in obese women and by 41% was the lowest in normal-weight women. Conclusion Excessive GWG is a significant risk factor for PE, especially in underweight women, while low GWG is an important protective factor against PE, especially in obese women.", "citation_paragraph": "The hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), including preeclampsia (PE), with placental dysfunction and indicated preterm birth remains a leading cause of maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity worldwide [1] [2] [3] . Identifying the risk factors for PE is therefore crucial for the implementation of preventive actions.Obesity is the most common problem in obstetrics that affects both the mother and the fetus. In Europe, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 16%-28% of women are obese [4] . It is considered that obesity increases the risk of PE [5] . Because obese women are more likely to gain excessive weight during pregnancy [6] , this further increases the risks. Excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) is, though, associated with obesity-related adverse pregnancy outcomes such as PE, gestational diabetes and macrosomia as well as postpartum weight retention and, thus, for long-term maternal overweight or obesity [7] . Therefore, the prevention of excess GWG could be an essential strategy for reducing the prevalence of obesity-related pregnancy outcomes [8] .In 2009, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) released the updated guidelines for GWG for each of the pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) groups [6] . The recommended weight gains for underweight, normal weight, overweight and obese women were 12.5-18, 11.5-16, 7.0-11.5 and 5.0-9.0 kg, respectively [6] . Most studies that have examined the relationship between total GWG and PE are based on the IOM recommendations [9] . When total GWG is categorized concerning the IOM's current GWG guidelines using a single measure of GWG for analyses, it is critical to account for the fact that a woman's opportunity to gain weight increases the longer she remains pregnant [10] . Ignoring the correlation between total GWG and gestational duration will make the association between low GWG and any gestational age (GA)-dependent outcome like PE uncertain [10] . However, to account for the natural dependency between total GWG and gestational duration, pregnancy weight-gain-forgestational-age charts have been recommended as a newer tool for isolating total GWG from gestational duration [10] [11] [12] .

Questions addressed are: What is qigong? How does it work? What evidence exists supporting its practice in integrative oncology? What barriers to wide-spread programming access exist? Methods: Sources for this discussion include a review of scholarly texts, the Internet, PubMed, field observations, and expert opinion. Results: Qigong is a gentle, mind/body exercise integral within Chinese medicine. Theoretical foundations include Chinese medicine energy theory, psychoneuroimmunology, the relaxation response, the meditation effect, and epigenetics. Research supports positive effects on quality of life (QOL), fatigue, immune function and cortisol levels, and cognition for individuals with cancer. There is indirect, scientific evidence suggesting that qigong practice may positively influence cancer prevention and survival. No one Qigong exercise regimen has been established as superior. Effective protocols do have common elements: slow mindful exercise, easy to learn, breath regulation, meditation, emphasis on relaxation, and energy cultivation including mental intent and self-massage. Conclusions: Regular practice of Qigong exercise therapy has the potential to improve cancer-related QOL and is indirectly linked to cancer prevention and survival. Wide-spread access to quality Qigong in cancer care programming may be challenged by the availability of existing programming and work force capacity.", "citation_paragraph": "If Qigong is to be accepted as a valued therapeutic intervention within our modern health care systems, edicts from legacy teaching and traditions within clinical practice are not sufficient justification for the adoption of innovation. Qigong needs to be subjected to the same scientific investigatory research scrutiny as any other clinically-based health care modalities. Growing acceptance of the field of integrative oncology, combined with a dedicated research agenda and funding availability, have resulted in exponential growth of published research investigating the theory and therapeutic value of Qigong in recent years. A 2015 extensive bibliographic review of therapeutic Tai chi (performed as internal Qigong) by Yang et al. examined over 500 studies [17] . This research evidence crossed most major clinical areas including cancer. Nearly 95% of the studies reported positive effects in one or more primary health outcomes studied with no evidence of serious adverse effects.The body of research addressing Qigong in cancer care is much more limited. Past challenges included few high quality studies. However, the existence of high quality research evidence in this area is growing. The growth and strength of new evidence is demonstrated in the chronology of conclusions of recent systematic reviews assessing the effects of Qigong in cancer care. A search of research evidence through 2010 by Chan et al. [18] concluded that due to a paucity of studies and a high risk of bias and methodological problems in the majority of topic-related studies, it was still too early to draw conclusive statements. Further, these researchers concluded that vigorously designed, large-scale, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) with validated outcome measures were needed. A more recent systematic review by Zeng et al. (2014) concluded that emerging evidence did demonstrate that Qigong/Tai chi had positive effects on the QOL, fatigue, immune function, and cortisol levels of cancer patients [19] . These researchers stated that results should be viewed cautiously due to the limited study quality. In 2016, Klein et al. [20] raised the bar on the quality of evidence being analyzed by a systematic review limiting study inclusions to RCTs with a minimum of 15 subjects per group by protocol. Eleven qualifying studies [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] examining a total of 831 subjects, using nine different Qigong protocols, were included in this most recent systematic review. These researchers validated the initial conclusions of Zeng et al., stating that the practice of Qigong positively influenced quality of life (QOL), fatigue, immune function and cortisol levels, and cognition in individuals with cancer [32] . Ongoing research promises to continue to inform this topic.While testimonials of individuals attributing the personal practice of Qigong with curing their cancers abound on the Internet, as of yet, no strong body of research evidence validating these claims exists. There is, however, indirect evidence that suggests the potential benefits of Qigong practice with regard to cancer prevention. The Shanghai Study, a large, prospective, longitudinal study being conducted in China, has identified exercise as a protective lifestyle factor influencing reduced cancer mortality rates [33] . The regular practice of Qigong exercise is known to boost the immune system and mediate the inflammatory response [24, 34] , two factors linked to cancer prognosis. Further, there is preliminary evidence that Qigong practice can influence the repair of telemeres [35] . Telemeres are chromosome ends, a specialized structure involved in the replication and stability of DNA molecules. Telemere damage has been associated with a poor prognosis for cancer survival [36] . This collective body of emerging evidence provides a rationale for future, objective, more rigorously controlled evaluations of the benefits of Qigong exercise practice with regards to cancer prevention and management.

METHODS The number of patients in outpatient department of respiratory diseases (ODRD) in a general hospital of Jinan, China, the air quality and meteorological data were collected for 1 year. By controlling the confounding factors such as \"day of the week\" effects and the meteorological factors, the generalized additive Poisson regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the impact of PM2.5 on the number of patients' visits to the ODRD.   RESULTS Within two consecutive days, if the cumulative PM2.5 was less than 200 \u00b5g/m(3), the daily number of patients in the ODRD did not increase significantly; however, it increased dramatically when the concentration of PM2.5 particles reached the range between 200 and 400 \u00b5g/m(3).   CONCLUSION There is a non-linear relationship between the concentration of atmospheric PM2.5 particles and the daily number of patients in the ODRD.", "citation_paragraph": "Suspended particles in the air can be divided into large particulate matter (PM) (diameter between 11 and 100 \u00b5m) and inhalable PM (diameter smaller than or equal to 10 \u00b5m, known as PM10). PM10 is divided into coarse PM (diameter between 2.5 and 10 \u00b5m) and fine PM (diameter less than or equal to 2.5, PM2.5). PM2.5 is defined as particles that are able to enter the lungs. Considerable evidence has demonstrated that atmospheric particles can have a tremendous impact on human health, the smaller the particle size, the greater the harm it may cause. The harm caused by fine particles of dust haze weather on human health is even greater than by a sand storm, as PM2.5 particles may contain a large number of toxic and harmful substances, stay longer in the atmosphere, convey long distance, and are easy to trigger asthma, bronchitis and other diseases [1] . PM2.5 particles can also be the carrier of viruses and bacteria to spread infectious diseases of the respiratory tract. In recent years, as air pollution in Jinan area is severely worse, PM2.5 is the main cause of haze weather, and its harm to environment and human health should not be neglected. The quantitative evaluation of health hazards of PM has become the research focus of WHO, the European Union and other international organizations. WHO pointed out that the PM2.5 higher than 25 \u00b5g/m 3 is harmful to human health [2] . Evidence showed that exposure to fine particulate air pollution was related to prevalent anxiety [3] . Long-term exposure to air pollution increased the incidence of blood hypertension in elderly [4, 5] . This study intended to evaluate the impact of PM2.5 level on the patients' visits to the Department of Respiratory Diseases in a general hospital in Jinan City, China. Because their relation may be not in simple linear, we used daily number of patients in the outpatient department of respiratory diseases (ODRD), time sequence method, and generalized additive models (GAM) to analyze the impact of PM2.5 level on the number of patients' visits in the ODRD.

{"s2orc_id": 10030523, "title": "Immunotherapeutic Potential of Oncolytic Vaccinia Virus", "abstract": "The concept of oncolytic viral therapy was based on the hypothesis that engineering tumor-selectivity into the replication potential of viruses would permit direct destruction of tumor cells as a result of viral-mediated lysis, resulting in amplification of the therapy exclusively within the tumor environment. The immune response raised by the virus was not only considered to be necessary for the safety of the approach, but also something of a hindrance to optimal therapeutic activity and repeat dosing. However, the pre-clinical and subsequent clinical success of several oncolytic viruses expressing selected cytokines has demonstrated the potential for harnessing the immune response as an additional and beneficial mechanism of therapeutic activity within the platform. Over the last few years, a variety of novel approaches have been incorporated to try to enhance this immunotherapeutic activity. Several innovative and subtle approaches have moved far beyond the expression of a single cytokine transgene, with the hope of optimizing anti-tumor immunity while having minimal detrimental impact on viral oncolytic activity.", "citation_paragraph": "In addition to the expression of immune stimulatory (or inhibitory) transgenes from the viral vectors, a variety of other options exist that can also have direct impact on the immune responses induced by the viral vectors.(i) Viral mutation: large DNA viruses such as vaccinia or HSV encode multiple virulence genes whose role is to antagonize or Frontiers in Oncology | Tumor Immunity deplete specific cytokines or to disrupt steps in the immune response. Selective deletion of specific virulence genes can therefore have two effects; deletion of these genes often results in tumor targeting (through attenuation of viral replication in non-tumor tissues) while also allowing additional induction of specific components of the immune response to be activated (28) . In this way, the immune response can be manipulated without seriously depleting viral oncolytic activity. (ii) Timing of immune activation: the therapeutic activity of oncolytic viral therapy can be considered to function in two steps, with an initial directly oncolytic phase mediated by viral lysis of tumor cells followed by an immunotherapeutic phase, where the host immune response clears additional infected tumor cells and ideally results in induction of an adaptive immune response against tumor antigens (as a result of the release of the tumor antigens along with viral PAMPs and host cell DAMPs). It is therefore apparent that the expression of immune activating transgenes would be most effective if limited to this second phase. One approach to achieve this is to apply exogenous regulation of transgene expression or to control the function of the protein after it is translated (32, 37) . In this way, it may be possible to achieve unhindered viral replication and so full oncolytic potential during the initial period after viral delivery and tumor infection, while subsequent activation of immune stimulatory transgene activity would enhance the level and type of immune response produced at later times. (iii) Targeting immune suppression: in addition to activating the immune response, oncolytic viral vectors can also transiently overcome immune suppression within the tumor. However, this effect is likely only temporary or limited and some evidence exists that additional targeting of these suppressive cells may further enhance oncolytic viral activity (46) . Because multiple suppressive immune cell types (including MDSC, M2 macrophages, and regulatory T-cells) often exist within the tumor, it may be necessary to target all these in a concerted fashion to ensure that a robust adaptive immune response is produced. (iv) Combination therapies: in addition, the development of multiple novel and effective immunotherapies means that the scope for combining oncolytic viral therapies with these other therapies continues to increase. There are a variety of approaches (such as combination with alternative adjuvants or antiimmune checkpoint inhibitors) that would be expected to produce significant synergistic benefit, and promising initial pre-clinical data means that these will be explored in more detail in the future. (v) Oncolytic viral vaccines: the fact that oncolytic viral therapies are capable of inducing an adaptive immune response against tumor antigens is likely to be hugely beneficial in the clearance of residual disease and metastases as well as in long term immune surveillance to prevent relapse. However, it is also likely that any adaptive immune response that is produced after viral therapy will primarily target antigens expressed on the bulk tumor cells. Because the cells that mediate relapse or metastasis often express distinct antigens to those on the bulk tumor cells within the primary tumor, it may be necessary to induce additional immunity against antigens on these cells. It has been demonstrated that the expression of these antigens as peptides or whole proteins from the oncolytic virus can permit additional protection against subsequent relapse (47) . It is therefore possible that expression of antigens from the virus may be further used to target other stromal cells within the tumor or to boost the immune response against tumor antigens and away from viral antigens.", "citance": "It has been demonstrated that the expression of these antigens as peptides or whole proteins from the oncolytic virus can permit additional protection against subsequent relapse (47) .", "claims": [{"text": "Expression of oncolytic virus antigens as peptides makes relapse more likely.", "subject": "Expression of oncolytic virus antigens as peptides", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Expression of oncolytic virus antigens as peptides permits additional protection against relapse.", "subject": "Expression of oncolytic virus antigens as peptides", "is_negation": false}]}

Mesenchymal progenitors located in bone regions other than the bone marrow also display bone-forming properties. However, owing to the differences in each distinct microenvironment, the mesenchymal characteristics of skeletal progenitor cells within different regions of long bones may show some differences. In order to clearly elucidate these differences, we performed a comparative study on mesenchymal progenitors from different regions of long bones. Here, we isolated mesenchymal progenitors from the periosteum, endosteum, and bone marrow of rat long bones. The three groups exhibited similar cellular morphologies and expressed the typical surface markers associated with mesenchymal stem cells. Interestingly, after cell proliferation assays and bidirectional differentiation analysis, periosteal mesenchymal progenitors showed a higher proliferative ability and adipogenic differentiation potential. In contrast, endosteal mesenchymal progenitors were more prone to osteogenic differentiation. Using in vitro osteoclast culture systems, conditioned media from different mesenchymal progenitor cultures were used to induce osteoclastic differentiation. Osteoclast formation was found to be significantly promoted by the secretion of RANKL and IL-6 by endosteal progenitors. Overall, our results provide strong evidence for the importance of selecting the appropriate source of skeletal progenitors for applications in future skeleton regeneration therapies.", "citation_paragraph": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or mesenchymal progenitors (MPs) are plastic-adherent fibroblast-like cells that are able to form colony-forming unit-fibroblasts (CFUFs) [1, 2] . According to the International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT), to identify and characterize MPs, they should express several cell surface markers, such as CD90, CD105, and CD73 and should not express CD45, CD34, CD14 or CD11b, CD79a or CD19, and HLA-DR [3, 4] . In a controlled environment in vitro, MPs exhibit the potential to differentiate into multiple cell types with mesodermal lineages, including osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes [5] [6] [7] . Additionally, MPs have immunosuppressive effects [8] . These characteristics make MPs a promising resource for regenerative medicine, clinical cell therapies, and tissue engineering.Usually, MPs are isolated from bone marrow. In recent years, MPs have also been found within multiple perinatal and adult tissues such as muscle, adipose, brain, and peripheral blood [9] . Owing to the differences in each microenvironment, the cell surface markers and functions of MPs from different sources are distinct. Recent studies have identified mouse and human skeletal stem cells (SSCs) that are enriched in the growth plate and express specific surface markers. SSCs are able to generate progenitors for bone, cartilage, and bone marrow stroma [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Lineage tracing studies have also revealed cathepsin K-Cre recombinase-(Ctsk-Cre-) labeled MPs in the perichondrium [15, 16] . In addition to bone marrow, the periosteum and endosteum are membranous structures that also contain MPs. The periosteum is composed of two layers: the outer \"fibrous\" layer and the inner \"cambium\" layer [17] . The outer layer contains attachment points for tendons, ligaments, and muscles; it contains an abundance of elastic fibers and collagen to allow sensitive responses to mechanical stresses. The inner layer is directly attached to the outer surface of the cortical bone and is highly cellularized and vascularized; it contains cells including MPs, fibroblasts, osteoblasts, microvessels, and sympathetic nerve cells [17] [18] [19] [20] . Upon bone injury, MPs are stimulated to differentiate into osteoblasts and chondrocytes to form new bone tissues for repair. Periosteum graft experiments have shown that periosteal MPs have a high regenerative ability [21] . In periostin-knockout mice, the functionality of periosteal MPs and fracture consolidation were shown to be impaired [22] . The endosteum is a layer of vascularized membrane attached to the inner surface of the cortical bone and is found at a distance of twelve cell diameters (~96 \u03bcm) from the bone surface [23] . The coupling of osteoblasts and osteoclasts within the endosteum sustains bone remodeling. The endosteum and bone marrow create microenvironments to support the growth and survival of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Interestingly, HSCs are not randomly distributed in the bone marrow; rather, they are preferentially distributed in the endosteum region and in periarterial sites; HSCs within the endosteum show an enhanced capacity for proliferation, homing, and hematopoiesis [24] [25] [26] . By isolating and comparing endosteal and bone marrow MPs, it was found that endosteal MPs show a greater efficiency for proliferation, differentiation, and metabolic activity [27] .Osteoclasts are multinuclear cells that are differentiated from mononuclear cells with a monocyte or macrophage lineage [28] and are mainly located on the surface of trabecular bone and the endosteum. The balance between osteoblastic bone formation and osteoclastic bone resorption maintains bone homeostasis. Osteoblasts affect osteoclast formation via direct contact and paracrine secretion [29] . RANK ligand (RANKL), which is secreted by osteoblasts and osteocytes, is a key factor for the stimulation of osteoclast differentiation [30] . In addition to mature osteoclasts, F4/80+ macrophages and TRAP+ osteoclasts have been found in the periosteum and endosteum; these cell types regulate the maintenance of mature osteoblasts in vivo [31] . Crosstalk between osteoclast progenitors and MSCs within the bone marrow is also important for osteoclast differentiation [32, 33] .In this study, we isolated and compared the properties of three samples of MPs extracted from different regions of long bones. We aimed to determine any differences in cell proliferation and differentiation and the effects on osteoclasts among the three MPs.", "citance": "In addition to mature osteoclasts, F4/80+ macrophages and TRAP+ osteoclasts have been found in the periosteum and endosteum; these cell types regulate the maintenance of mature osteoblasts in vivo [31] .", "claims": [{"text": "F4/80+ macrophages regulate mature osteoblast maintenance.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "TRAP+ osteoclasts regulate mature osteoblast maintenance.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 30057386, "title": "Dual function of Swc5 in SWR remodeling ATPase activation and histone H2A eviction", "abstract": "The chromatin remodeler SWR deposits histone H2A.Z at promoters and other regulatory sites via an ATP-driven histone exchange reaction that replaces nucleosomal H2A with H2A.Z. Simultaneous binding of SWR to both H2A nucleosome and free H2A.Z induces SWR ATPase activity and engages the histone exchange mechanism. Swc5 is a conserved subunit of the 14-polypeptide SWR complex that is required for the histone exchange reaction, but its molecular role is unknown. We found that Swc5, although not required for substrate binding, is required for SWR ATPase stimulation, suggesting that Swc5 is required to couple substrate recognition to ATPase activation. A biochemical complementation assay was developed to show that a unique, conserved domain at the C-terminus of Swc5, called Bucentaur (BCNT), is essential for the histone exchange activity of SWR, whereas an acidic region at the N-terminus is required for optimal SWR function. In vitro studies showed the acidic N-terminus of Swc5 preferentially binds to the H2A-H2B dimer and exhibits histone chaperone activity. We propose that an auxiliary function of Swc5 in SWR is to assist H2A ejection as H2A.Z is inserted into the nucleosome.", "citation_paragraph": "Swc5 is essential for SWR-mediated H2A.Z deposition in vitro and in vivo, but how this subunit participates in the histone exchange mechanism was unclear (25, 34) . This work shows that Swc5 is required for optimal stimulation of the SWR ATPase when the remodeler is bound to the in vivo histone substrates, i.e. H2A-containing nucleosomes and H2A.Z-H2B dimers (Figure 7 , symbolized by the orange arrows). The next question is how Swc5 stimulates the SWR ATPase at the mechanistic level. One possibility is that Swc5 may function as a linchpin that holds the Swr1 polypeptide scaffold in a conformation that is capable to be activated. Alternatively, but not exclusively, Swc5 may act as a molecular lever that transduces the conformational change caused by the binding of the histone substrates to a regulatory component of Swr1 ATPase to lift its inhibition.Crosslinking analysis of native SWR followed by mass spectrometry revealed proximity of Swc5 to the Swr1 polypeptide at regions near the ATPase domain and the HSA domain, which has been implicated in ATPase regulation (33, 54) . Biochemical studies further showed that stable interaction of Swc5 to the SWR complex requires two regions flanking the Swr1 ATPase domain: a 17-aa region at the C-terminus of Swr1 and a region immediately downstream of the HSA domain called the post-HSA domain (44, 54) . In the RSC remodeler complex, the HSA domain, which serves as a platform for the assembly of the actinrelated proteins Arp7 and Arp9, and Rtt102, together with the post-HSA domain, couple ATPase activity to histone movement (54, 55) . Similar regulatory function may be exerted by the Swr1 HSA and post-HSA domains and its associating factors actin (Act1) and Arp4 (54, 56) (Figure 7) . A recent study showed Swc5 is physically linked to one of two actin subunits within SWR (44) , suggesting that this actin could be working together with Swc5 to regulate ATPase motor activity.Interestingly, the same study also showed SWR without Swc5 exhibits normal ATPase stimulation when bound by AA nucleosomes, in contrast to our results (44) . The cause of the discrepancy is unknown but could be due to the different sources of SWR used in the in vitro assays. Our SWR[swc5 ] complex was purified from yeast and may contain native post-translational modification(s) that suppress substrate-dependent ATPase activation when Swc5 is absent. The yeast SWR[swc5 ] complex purified by Lin et al. was expressed in insect cells and may lack such regulatory modification(s) (44) .Activation of the SWR ATPase also requires the Swc2 subunit (57) . SWR purified from swc2\u0394 cells lacks Swc2 and Swc3 and is deficient for the Swc6, and Arp6 subunits (32, 34) . The resulting SWR[swc2 ] complex has no histone exchange activity and the SWR ATPase cannot be activated by the histone substrates (57) . However, unlike SWR[swc5 ], the SWR[swc2 ] complex has strong defects in the binding of AA nucleosomes and H2A.Z-H2B dimers (32, 34) . This binding defect could be the basis for the loss of ATPase activation in SWR[swc2 ].Incubating recombinant Swc5 with native SWR[swc5\u0394] purified from yeast restored the H2A.Z deposition activity of the complex in vitro. This result suggests that Swc5 binds to the SWR complex at a location that is solvent accessible. However, the rescue of the histone exchange activity was partial even when recombinant Swc5 was bound to the SWR complex stoichiometrically. One explanation could be that Swc5 is covalently modified in vivo to allow optimal activation of SWR. Consistent with this idea, mass spectrometry studies have identified phosphorylation sites in the yeast Swc5 and the human CFDP1 homolog (58, 59) . Alternatively, but not exclusively, Swc5 may be important to stabilize the rest of the SWR components. In the absence of Swc5, some critical components of SWR may have dissociated irreversibly after purification, preventing the partial complexes from being rescued by the recombinant Swc5. The conserved Swc5-A domain is required for specific H2A-H2B binding An outstanding question in the understanding of SWRmediated histone exchange reaction is whether the remodeler assists in the eviction of the H2A-H2B dimer (9) . Our work has uncovered a previously unknown function of Swc5--the preferential binding to the H2A-H2B dimer to assist its eviction during the histone exchange process. The binding specificity of Swc5 for H2A as a free dimer with H2B rather than H2A in the context of the nucleosome suggests that Swc5 recognizes at least part of the surface on the H2A-H2B dimer that is excluded by the DNA or the other histones within a nucleosome. The Swc5-A domain is predicted to be unstructured, suggesting that induced folding is expected upon binding to the H2A-H2B dimer. Similar examples have been documented for several histone binding domains, including the Chz-domain of Chz1, the Swr1-Z domain of Swr1, and the Swc2-Z domain of Swc2 (42, 60, 61) . But unlike the aforementioned examples, where the H2A.Z-H2B dimer is the preferred binding partner, the Swc5-A domain of Swc5 prefers H2A-H2B.Although the Swc5-A domain is required for optimal H2A.Z deposition in vitro, it is dispensable in vivo based on the formamide plate test, which is a proxy for in vivo H2A.Z deposition. One explanation for this discrepancy is that the in vitro exchange assay is more sensitive and thus is capable of revealing the partial H2A.Z deposition defect of the Swc5-A domain truncation mutant, whereas the formamide test can tolerate the suboptimal deposition of H2A.Z. Al- ternatively, the H2A-H2B eviction defect may be compensated for inside the cell by other histone chaperone(s), such as FACT, but probably not Nap1 ( Figure 3F ) (62) . An unstructured acidic region similar to the yeast Swc5-A domain is found in virtually all Swc5 homologs with the exception of plant Swc5 (Supplementary Figure S7A) . Perhaps, in plants, the individual histone chaperone proteins play a more dominant role in cooperating with SWR to facilitate the H2A eviction step.The BCNT core is essential for the histone exchange activity of SWR Swc5 is well conserved among eukaryotes and is known as BCNT in ruminants, CFDP1 in humans, CP27 in mice, and YETI in flies (58, 63, 64) . BCNT was first identified in ruminants where part of the Bcnt gene was duplicated and fused in-frame with an endonuclease domain derived from a bovine-specific retrotransposon, hence the name Bucentaur (65) . However, the BCNT-endonuclease fusion is unique to ruminants. The full-length Swc5 homologs found in all eukaryotes, including ruminants, contain the conserved 73-amino-acid BCNT domain (Pfam: PF07572) at the C-terminus (66) . The conservation found in the yeast Swc5 is more restricted to a 55-amino-acid core region (57-amino-acid in humans) that is termed the BCNT core domain in Supplementary Figure S7B . Secondary structure informatics indicates strong alpha helical characteristics in the BCNT core, within which a consensus motif [K (T/S) (T/V)LEK(S/T)-xx-DW-xx-(F/Y)] revealed a striking organization of eight highly conserved residues (highlighted in bold) along one face of the predicted alpha helix (Supplementary Figure S11 , underlined in pink). Alanine substitutions within the motif in yeast Swc5 (i.e. TTLEKS\u21926A and LDW\u21923A) completely abolished its function in vivo and in vitro. Similarly, truncating the BCNT core at the Cterminal half also abrogated Swc5 function. These experiments therefore confirm the requirement of the BCNT core in the SWR-mediated remodeling reaction. It is important to point out, however, that the BCNT core is not required for binding the H2A-H2B dimer during the ejection step. Therefore, the Swc5-A domain and the BCNT core domain on the opposite ends of the Swc5 polypeptide play independent roles in the H2A.Z deposition process (Figure 7) .Given the conservation of Swc5 and the central role it plays in the histone exchange reaction of SWR, it was therefore surprising that CFDP1 was absent in the original purification of SRCAP and EP400, the human SWR complexes (67, 68) . A more recent high-throughput proteomic study has found that CFDP1 co-elutes with SRCAP and DMAP1, which are the human homologs of Swr1 and Swc6, suggesting direct physical interaction (69) . However, the molecular role of CFDP1 in H2A.Z deposition remains to be confirmed. Recent studies in flies suggested that YETI plays a chromatin remodeling role (64) . However,Yeti mutants exhibited a massive chromosomal defect that is associated with loss of all histones (not just H2A.Z) (64) . Therefore, the direct role of YETI in H2A.Z deposition remains to be seen.", "citance": "One explanation for this discrepancy is that the in vitro exchange assay is more sensitive and thus is capable of revealing the partial H2A.Z deposition defect of the Swc5-A domain truncation mutant, whereas the formamide test can tolerate the suboptimal deposition of H2A.Z.

Indeed, the prominence of mutations in specific adhesome molecules in various human diseases is now appreciated, and experimental as well as in silico approaches provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these pathological conditions.", "citation_paragraph": "Cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins that polymerize into stable filaments of ~10 nm in diameter.

In addition to a deficiency in neutrophil rolling, which is also seen in mice expressing the hypomor phic allele of \u03b22 integrin, animals that carry a complete deletion of \u03b22 integrin have deficiencies in T cell acti vation 44, 45 or extravasation 46 , and also display aberrant B cell differentiation that results from an increase in interleukin6 (IL6) production 47 . The source and rea son for an increase in IL6 expression in \u03b22 i ntegrinnull mice has not been determined. Reduced apoptosis in \u03b22 integrinnull neutrophils in combination with its increased accumulation in the blood, due to a defect in extravasation, probably explains the neutrophilia observed in patients 48 . Furthermore, the delayed wound healing detected in patients with LADI may be due to the impaired differentiation of myofibroblasts, which are required for wound closure. Myofibroblast differ entiation is dependent on transforming growth factor\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) 49 , which is secreted from macrophages as they ingest neutrophils at the wound site 50 . In the absence of \u03b22 integrin, not only are there fewer neutrophils present in the wound, but macrophages can no longer engulf cells or secrete TGF\u03b2 51 . This defective signalling cas cade, which leads to prolonged healing times, illustrates that mutating components of the adhesome can have consequences beyond cell autonomous adhesion and signallin g defects.Owing to the restricted expression of kindlin 3 in the haematopoietic system and endothelium 52, 53 , mutations in the FERMT3 gene that encodes this protein mani fest as haematopoietic disorders.

Likewise, deletion of \u03b17 integrin in mice leads to a mus cular dystrophy phenotype 66, 67 , in addition to vascular smooth muscle defects that have not been reported in humans 68 , possibly because the alterations found in humans are not as severe as those caused by the absence of the protein. As with other muscular dystrophies, dele tion of \u03b17 integrin causes muscle degeneration that is characterized by centrally located nuclei and variable fibre size 66 .

{"s2orc_id": 25640506, "title": "Crossing the perspectives of patients, families, and physicians on cancer treatment: A qualitative study", "abstract": "PURPOSE Patients, family members, and physicians participate in cancer care, but their perspectives about what is helpful during cancer treatment have rarely been compared. The aim of this study was to compare these three perspectives.   METHODS Multicenter qualitative study (with previously published protocol) based on 90 semi-structured interviews. Participants (purposively selected until data saturation) came from three different subsamples: (i) patients with cancer (n=30), (ii) their relatives (n=30), and (iii) their referring physicians (n=10, interviewed more than once).   RESULTS Our analysis found 3 main axes (perceived positive effects of cancer treatment, perceived negative effects of cancer treatment, doctor-physician relationship), each composed of 2 main themes. The findings showed that patients, families, and physicians shared the long-term objective of increasing survival (while reducing side effects). However, patients and relatives also pointed out the importance of living with cancer each day and thus of factors helping them to live as well as possible in daily life. The physicians' difficulty in coping with patients' suffering may limit their access to elements that can improve patients' capacity to live as well as possible.   CONCLUSIONS During cancer treatment (and not only at the end of life), attention should be given to enhancing the capacity of patients to live as well as possible (not only as long as possible) to meet the goals of patient-centered care and satisfy this important need of patients and families.", "citation_paragraph": "Our analysis of the perspectives of patients, their relatives, and their physicians toward cancer treatment showed that all participants shared the long-term objective of increasing survival (while reducing side effects). Nonetheless, it was mainly the patients and their family members who also pointed out the importance of living with cancer on a day-to-day basis and thus of the elements that enable them to live as well as possible in their everyday activities.The presence of family members (loved ones) and involvement in meaningful activity emerged as the main elements of a good quality of life. Although these points were previously known, most physicians have not yet fully understood them, and their use as therapeutic tools has been relatively sparse. Thus, these factors optimizing patients' ability to live the best lives possible have remained marginal and could not become a focus of cancer treatment. These findings echo those of other studies about the needs -met and unmet -of patients treated for cancer and their family members. For example, studies have showed that physicians fail to take into account the spiritual and religious concerns of their severely ill patients [25] [26] [27] [28] , despite recommendations [29] , patients' preferences [26] , and the demonstrated benefit in terms of patients' satisfaction [27] . These reports are evidence of mismatched perceptions between patients and doctors [30] . Similarly, families play an important role in fostering the patients' ability to live as well as possible in all phases of the cancer journey (diagnosis, treatment, palliative, and end-of-life periods), as one study has demonstrated [31] . Nevertheless, for families to fulfill this critical function, they require support that meets their psychological, spiritual, physical and social needs [32] .Why do physicians have such limited access to the factors helping patients to live their daily lives as well as possible? Our third axis (the patient-physician relationship) suggests that oncologists' capacity to embrace patients' negative feelings and emotions could be a barrier to their access to the factors that improve the patients' capacity to live as well as possible. Our qualitative analyses revealed that when patients explicitly expressed their suffering and struggle to cope with their disease-related negative emotions, their physicians found it difficult to deal with these emotions during consultation. This has also been shown in other settings, for instance, in relation to physicians' lack of training in discussing spiritual concerns [32, 33] . On the other hand, when patients who appear able to cope effectively with their illness do not unambiguously articulate these negative emotions, physicians find it difficult to go beyond this superficial image and inquire about the patients' hardships. This distance may be due to the attitudes of patients who prefer not to disclose their emotion and want to focus only on medical subjects, but also to physicians who lack the tools to gain access to and deal helpfully with patients' emotions).In either case, this distance creates the risk of overlooking patients' suffering and failing to mobilize the resources (family members or meaningful activities or both) that will optimize their quality of life during the treatment period.The increased survival of cancer patients due to advances in oncology has led to longer, chronic disease and requires them to be in treatment for longer periods (e.g., multiple courses of chemotherapy, alternating radiotherapy and chemotherapy, side effects, and pain).Note: This table reports exemplary quotations supporting our results. Q1 to Q21 are referred to in square brackets in the results section.Two consequences are worth noting. First, prolonging treatments and only focusing on the quantity of life (sometimes with overaggressive treatment) [34, 35] does not fit all patients' needs, and in some cases (e.g., endstage cancers) may not improve survival [36] . Nor does it meet the needs of family members, who do not experience either better bereavement [36] or relief from their stress, pain, and suffering [37] . The overwhelming limitation of these issues to the field of palliative medicine [38] and the short shrift given them in curative medicine creates an illusion that these topics are important only when death can no longer be postponed (i.e., when no curative treatment exists) [39] . Any cancer, however, is an arduous experience, regardless of its prognosis and the extent of the treatment burden. Our study shows that physicians are interested in the future (survival) but fail to pay enough attention to the present by fostering the capacity to live as well as possible during the daily life of treatment. The psychosocial needs reported in cancer survivors [11] and their families [40] exemplify the extent to which these issues have been neglected during the treatment phase.Second, with the increased chronicity of cancer comes the need for a different kind of care relationship, one in which physicians can cope with -and help patients to cope with -the patients' needs and feelings (including negative emotions) beyond medical management and can assume the relational dimension of care. Although professional psychological interventions are useful for patients facing severe illness [41] , not every patient needs these interventions. Splitting care and cure (and outsourcing care to other professionals) can produce silo cultures and negatively affect patient management and satisfaction [39] . Improving the education of oncologists may be a key factor in preventing this gap between care and cure, by preparing physicians to assume this dimension of care and develop awareness of their own practices. One viable educational intervention, for instance, could be the implementation of discussion groups (such as Balint groups, designed to improve clinicians' skills by discussing personal cases focusing on patient-doctor interaction) [42] . The effectiveness of these groups has already been shown in several areas, including improving communication skills, dealing more effectively with patient needs, and managing physicians' involvement in their patient-physician relationships; it also increases physicians' well-being [43] [44] [45] .Finally, improved knowledge about cancer support groups and complementary medicine could enable physicians to refer patients to these activities, which appear to meet some of their needs.", "citance": "Similarly, families play an important role in fostering the patients' ability to live as well as possible in all phases of the cancer journey (diagnosis, treatment, palliative, and end-of-life periods), as one study has demonstrated [31] .", "claims": [{"text": "Families play an important role in the diagnosis, treatment, palliative, and end-of-life periods of a cancer patient's journey.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 7083951, "title": "Loss of astrocytic domain organization in the epileptic brain.", "abstract": "Gliosis is a pathological hallmark of posttraumatic epileptic foci, but little is known about these reactive astrocytes beyond their high glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression. Using diolistic labeling, we show that cortical astrocytes lost their nonoverlapping domain organization in three mouse models of epilepsy: posttraumatic injury, genetic susceptibility, and systemic kainate exposure. Neighboring astrocytes in epileptic mice showed a 10-fold increase in overlap of processes. Concurrently, spine density was increased on dendrites of excitatory neurons. Suppression of seizures by the common antiepileptic, valproate, reduced the overlap of astrocytic processes. Astrocytic domain organization was also preserved in APP transgenic mice expressing a mutant variant of human amyloid precursor protein despite a marked upregulation of GFAP. Our data suggest that loss of astrocytic domains was not universally associated with gliosis, but restricted to seizure pathologies. Reorganization of astrocytes may, in concert with dendritic sprouting and new synapse formation, form the structural basis for recurrent excitation in the epileptic brain.", "citation_paragraph": "This study used diolistic labeling of cortical tissue to study the fine architecture of reactive astrocytes in the epileptic mouse brain. Our analysis confirmed that cortical astrocytes in normal adult brain are organized in nonoverlapping domains with minimal interdigitation of their processes. Extending the analysis to several mouse models of epilepsy revealed a marked increase in overlap of processes between adjacent astrocytes. Loss of astrocytic domains was, however, not a universal feature of reactive gliosis, because overlap of astrocytic processes was not noted in transgenic mice expressing mutant human APP despite a marked upregulation of GFAP. Further- more, epileptic animals that responded to medical suppression of seizure exhibited a sharp reduction in the loss of their domain organization. Thus, gliosis, per se, may be a necessary condition for loss of astrocyte domain organization, but it is not sufficient.We noted two morphologically distinct types of reactive astrocytes in animals with focal epilepsy. Palisading astrocytes immediately surrounded the injury site, and their processes formed a halo around the lesion with striking radial orientation. The processes were mainly straight, lacking the profuse and delicate veil-like ramifications of normal protoplasmic astrocytes. Palisading astrocytes exhibited a complete loss of individual domains and appeared to form a physical barrier separating the lesion from the surrounding cortical tissue (McGraw et al., 2001) . The second type of astrocyte was termed hypertrophic and was located just beyond the annular sector occupied by palisading astrocytes. Their defining features were less extreme, but conspicuous when subjected to quantitative morphological analysis. Upregulation of GFAP and greater process thickness were hallmarks of hypertrophic astrocytes, but the number of fine veil-like processes was also clearly reduced.Interestingly, the morphological changes of astrocytes surrounding epileptic foci were accompanied by distinct changes in neurons. Neurons in the vicinity of palisading astrocytes exhibited less dendritic spines and a thinning of their dendrites, confirming numerous studies reporting a general loss of dendritic spines in epileptic brains (Swann et al., 2000) . In cortical areas populated by hypertrophic astrocytes, there was a subtle but significant hypertrophy of dendrites of excitatory neurons concurrent with an increase in spine density. This hypertrophy of dendrites distant to the epileptic focus has not been reported previously. Likely, the dramatic reduction of dendrites and spines near the injury site has overshadowed the modest hypertrophy. The large sample size needed to detect the minor increment in spine numbers was easily obtained in our study based on YFP expression in transgenic mice, compared with the cumbersome tracer injection techniques used previously. An increase of spine density in the dentate gyrus has previously been viewed as a structural basis for recurrent excitation and abnormal circuit function in kainate-induced epilepsy (Tauck and Nadler, 1985; Suzuki et al., 1997; Wuarin and Dudek, 2001 ). As such, our study adds new dimensions to the structural changes of both astrocytes and dendrites that accompany a model of posttraumatic epilepsy.An important distinction to be drawn is between astrocyte volume and domain volume. Using the diolistic staining technique, we directly measured astrocyte volume referring to the cytosolic volume of individual astrocytes. Domain volume is defined by the threedimensional boundaries of an astrocyte and contains all \"brain\" space within these boundaries. The literature on \"domains\" therefore must be read with this distinction in mind. The reported domain sizes of normal protoplasmic astrocytes have varied greatly from 14,700 m 3 (Chvatal et al., 2007) in live astrocytes in cortical brain slices to 85,300 m 3 (Ogata and Kosaka, 2002) and 65,900 m 3 (Bushong et al., 2002) in fixed preparations of hippocampus. Domain sizes may have been influenced by regional differences in astrocyte size or variation caused by fixation where interstitial space is largely obliterated in perfusion-fixed brain (Bushong et al., 2002) . The latter explanation is contradicted by the observation that cortical astrocyte domain volume was reported to average 22,906 m 3 in frozen sections and 21,033 m 3 in intact live animals (Halassa et al., 2007) . The astrocytic cell volume reported here is smaller (\u03f36500 m 3 ), because we, in contrast to other studies, quantified the actual volume of astrocytes rather than the total volume of astrocytic domains. This difference may also explain why a recent report concluded that the size of astrocytic domains did not increase during reactive gliosis (Wilhelmsson et al., 2006) . Hypertrophy of astrocytic processes will not affect the volume of the domain if the growth occurs within the confines of a domain. The same study also found that reactive astrocytes maintained the domain organization after deafferentation of the dentate gyrus (Wilhelmsson et al., 2006) . This injury model is only inconsistently associated with seizure pathology (Kopniczky et al., 2005) , thus indirectly supporting the conclusion that loss of astrocytic domain organization is restricted to pathologies associated with EEG abnormalities.Furthermore, it will be intriguing to examine the differences in astrocyte domain organization between Alzheimer's disease models with and without focal EEG abnormalities. The hAPPJ20 mice, which are reported to manifest nonconvulsive seizures, have three mutations in the hAPP gene, compared with two in the Tg2576 model used here, leading to earlier development of A\u2424 plaques and a more severe phenotype (Palop et al., 2007) . We predict that these animals would also exhibit loss of the domain organization in areas surrounding the seizure foci.The concept that astrocytes are organized in nonoverlapping domains was independently discovered by two groups (Bushong et al., 2002; Ogata and Kosaka, 2002) . It was an important step because it had been previously thought that astrocytes formed a syncytium that filled empty space and otherwise lacked any higher level of organization. The functional significance of domain organization is not understood in detail, but a domain defines a functional unit that integrates the activity of a larger contiguous set of synapses. Astrocytes express receptors for glutamate, GABA, and most neuromodulators and respond over a slow time scale from seconds to minutes to input. In turn, astrocytes release gliotransmitters including ATP, D-serine, and glutamate, which modulate synaptic transmission. The observation reported here, that astrocytic processes interdigitate and thereby violate the domain organization in the epileptic brain, may provide a useful tool for future studies defining the functional significance of astrocytic architecture.The changes in astrocyte structure and loss of domain organization that occur during gliosis are paralleled by functional changes. Human and rodent studies have shown that reactive astrocytes downregulate the glutamate transporter GLT-1, as well as glutamine synthetase in epilepsy (Mathern et al., 1999; Samuelsson et al., 2000; Proper et al., 2002; Eid et al., 2004; Maragakis and Rothstein, 2004) . This may lead to an increase of glutamate in astrocytes resulting in its excessive release, triggering synchronized depolarization of groups of neurons, or paroxysmal depolarization shifts (Tian et al., 2005) . Reactive astrocytes have also been shown to downregulate inward rectifying K \u03e9 channels (Kir), specifically Kir4.1, in posttraumatic and temporal lobe epilepsy, leading to impairment of clearance of extracellular K \u03e9 , linked to neuronal hyperexcitability (Bordey and Sontheimer, 1998; Heinemann et al., 2000; Hinterkeuser et al., 2000; Schroder et al., 2000) . In addition, aquaporin-4, the major water channel, loses its polarized location in astrocytic endfeet and becomes distributed across the entire cell body, potentially contributing to abnormalities of both water homeostasis and K \u03e9 buffering (Eid et al., 2005 ).An issue not addressed in this study is whether loss of astrocyte domain organization precedes the changes in dendritic structures or vice versa. Does the overlap of astrocytic processes contribute to increase in spine density or does new synapse formation leads to interdigitation of astrocytic processes? It is known from work in the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system that retraction of astrocytic processes can lead to dramatic increases in number of synapses (Theodosis et al., 2004) . Also, it has been demonstrated that astrocyte contact to dendritic protrusions both stabilizes and stimulates maturation of dendritic spines (Nishida and Okabe, 2007) . Based on these studies, we speculate that loss of fine processes in hypertrophic astrocytes contributes to dendritic sprouting in widespread areas around an epileptic focus. Additional studies are clearly needed, but structural alterations of dendrites and astrocytes may, in concert, form the basis for the abnormal circuit in the epileptic brain. It is in this regard important to note that valproate dampened seizure activity and at the same time reduced reactive changes of astrocytes and preserved their domain organization. It has been known for centuries that seizures early in life, most notably febrile seizures (Chen et al., 1999) , reduce the threshold for development of epilepsy. We show here that seizure induces permanent changes in the structure and organization of astrocytes, in addition to the well described morphological alterations of neurons (Golarai et al., 2001; Tavazoie et al., 2005; Zha et al., 2005; Bausch et al., 2006) . Together, these observations underpin the importance of aggressive clinical management of seizure to avoid long-lasting structural damage to the brain.", "citance": "It has been known for centuries that seizures early in life, most notably febrile seizures (Chen et al., 1999) , reduce the threshold for development of epilepsy.", "claims": [{"text": "Febrile seizures increase the threshold for development of epilepsy.", "subject": "Febrile seizures", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Febrile seizures reduce the threshold for development of epilepsy.", "subject": "Febrile seizures", "is_negation": false}]}

These adult muscle stem cells facilitate the postnatal growth, remodeling, and regeneration of skeletal muscle. Given the remarkable regenerative potential of satellite cells, there is great promise for treatment of muscle pathologies such as the muscular dystrophies with this cell population. Various protocols have been developed which allow for isolation, enrichment, and expansion of satellite cell derived muscle stem cells. However, isolated satellite cells have yet to translate into effective modalities for therapeutic intervention. Broadening our understanding of satellite cells and their niche requirements should improve our in vivo and ex vivo manipulation of these cells to expedite their use for regeneration of diseased muscle. This review explores the fates of satellite cells as determined by their molecular signatures, ontogeny, and niche dependent programming.", "citation_paragraph": "In normal, resting muscle, the majority of satellite cells are maintained in a quiescent state. Upon injury and muscle repair, a subset of the satellite cell population must re-enter quiescence to maintain tissue homeostasis. While much is known with respect to the factors which facilitate satellite cell activation, self-renewal, and differentiation, the mechanisms mediating quiescence are less understood. As previously mentioned, several cell extrinsic factors are demonstrated to play a role in the blunting of activating signals present in the niche [107] . In addition, satellite cells also possess cell intrinsic factors which facilitate maintenance of the quiescent state. Receptor tyrosine kinase signaling seems to be central in maintaining the homeostasis of satellite cell populations [98, 111] . FGF is a ligand which signals through receptor tyrosine kinases and is implicated in the activation of satellite cells that do not express the negative regulator of FGF signalingSprouty1 [111] . Sprouty1 is expressed in quiescent adult Pax7+ cells and upon injury it is downregulated to permit expansion of satellite cell populations and then re-expressed in Pax7+ cells to facilitate quiescence in a subset of the activated satellite cells [111] .Another potential mediator of satellite cell quiescence is the TGF-\u03b2 family member, myostatin. Several reports evidence an increase in the muscle mass of animals with deficient myostatin signaling and attribute this phenomenon to an increase in the recruitment of normally quiescent satellite cells to muscle fibers [112] [113] [114] . Surprisingly, HGF which is a known activator of satellite cells and promotes their proliferation has recently been shown to upregulate myostatin expression at elevated concentrations [115] . It is tempting to speculate that in injured muscle, expression of HGF is initially low and coincides with a period of expansion of satellite cell populations and that eventually a threshold is reached upon which myostatin is upregulated to mediate quiescence in a subset of the population [115] . Interestingly, a recent report has challenged the role of myostatin in mediating satellite cell quiescence wherein it was postulated that myostatin instead functions to control the protein balance and myonuclear size within muscle fibers [116] .The receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathway has also been proposed to mediate quiescence through the effects of Ang1/Tie-2 signaling [98] . The cellular receptor Tie-2 is expressed by quiescent but not activated satellite cells [98] . The Tie-2 ligand, Ang1, is expressed both by satellite cells and cells occupying the satellite cell niche such as smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts [98] . Satellite cells can be induced to enter quiescence by activation of Ang1/Tie-2 signaling, in vivo, while inhibition of Ang1/Tie-2 signaling leads to an increase in the number of proliferating satellite cells [98] . Thus, it is evident that several signaling pathways are able to maintain satellite cells in a quiescent state. Whether these different signaling pathways converge to modulate the quiescence of satellite cells or differentially affect satellite cell quiescence in a context dependent manner is to be determined.", "citance": "FGF is a ligand which signals through receptor tyrosine kinases and is implicated in the activation of satellite cells that do not express the negative regulator of FGF signalingSprouty1 [111] .", "claims": [{"text": "Fibroblast Growth Factor is a ligand which signals through receptor tyrosine kinases.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Nevertheless, reported studies involve limited number of cases to reliably assess the nature of these associations. Our aim was to examine the relation of these three biomarkers with pre-eclampsia risk in a large Colombian population.   MATERIALS AND METHODS Design: A case-control study. Setting: Cases of pre-eclampsia and healthy pregnant controls were recruited at the time of delivery from eight different Colombian cities between 2000 and 2012. Population or Sample: 2978 cases and 4096 controls were studied. Maternal serum concentrations of folate, homocysteine, and vitamin B12 were determined in 1148 (43.6%) cases and 1300 (31.7%) controls. Also, self-reported folic acid supplementation was recorded for 2563 (84%) cases and 3155 (84%) controls. Analysis: Adjusted odds ratios (OR) for pre-eclampsia were estimated for one standard deviation (1SD) increase in log-transformed biomarkers. Furthermore, we conducted analyses to compare women that reported taking folic acid supplementation for different periods during pregnancy. Main Outcomes Measures: Odds ratio for pre-eclampsia.   RESULTS After adjusting for potential confounders in logistic regression models, the OR for pre-eclampsia was 0.80 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.90) for 1SD increase in log-folate, 1.16 (95%CI: 1.05, 1.27) for 1SD increase in log-homocysteine, and 1.10 (95%CI: 0.99, 1.22) for 1SD increase in log-vitamin B12. No interactions among the biomarkers were identified. Women who self-reported consumption of folic acid (1 mg/day) throughout their pregnancy had an adjusted OR for pre-eclampsia of 0.86 (95%CI: 0.67, 1.09) compared to women that reported no consumption of folic acid at any point during pregnancy.

This comparison across multiple groups (i.e. controls, early and late onset and severe PE, was conducted using ANOVA.Multiple imputations were performed for the observations with incomplete information related to maternal serum concentrations of folate, homocysteine and vitamin B12 in order to minimize variations in the estimations. Hence, sample proportions with values outside the detection limits of the assay were 4% for folate, 3% for homocysteine, and 39% for vitamin B12 (S1 Table) . Due to the significant sample proportion obtained below the detection limit for vitamin B12, multiple imputations were used for these values in order to minimize variations in the estimations (S1 Appendix), instead of excluding them or performing simple substitutions. The latter has shown to produce altered results when the proportion of values outside the detection limit is greater than 30% [21] [22] . For the quality control samples, Lin's concordance correlation coefficient [23] was estimated for both measurements, and indicated a Multiple logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between maternal serum concentrations of folate, homocysteine and vitamin B12, and pre-eclampsia. Crude odds ratios (OR), 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) and in some cases, standard deviation, were estimated for each blood marker. Likewise, estimates were adjusted for maternal age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, multiple pregnancy, smoking, infections during pregnancy, recruitment centre, and recruitment year. In order to evaluate possible changes of the effect of the biomarkers over time, interactions between the biomarkers and the year of recruitment (i.e. year of sampling) were tested in multivariable models the likelihood ratio test (LRT) (comparing nested models with and without the interaction term). For sub-phenotype analyses, all biomarkers were logtransformed, standardized, and introduced as continuous variables into adjusted logistic models that simultaneously estimated the association of each metabolite with the presence of earlyand late-onset pre-eclampsia.Dose response association. The association of maternal serum concentrations of folate, homocysteine, and vitamin B12 with pre-eclampsia was assessed in logistic regression models by introducing the biomarkers as continuous variables after logarithmic transformation (given their positively-skewed distributions). Restricted cubic spline functions were used to evaluate the dose response in these models after adjusting for maternal age, gestational age, recruitment centre, and ethnicity. The spline functions were fitted with three internal knots since this provided the best fit (S1 Appendix). Departures from linearity were determined through LRT [24] by comparing models with and without the nonlinear components of the splines.Association analyses of biomarker levels with pre-eclampsia. Logistic regression models followed progressive adjustment accounting for different maternal variables such as age, recruitment centre, recruitment date year-over-year, self-reported ethnicity, multiple pregnancy, smoking, socioeconomic position (in two categories), infections during pregnancy, and gestational age (in weeks). The association of maternal folate levels and pre-eclampsia was also adjusted by folic acid supplementation in those participants that had information for both (Fig  1) . Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were reported.Two potential effect modifications were also examined. The first evaluated the influence that folate and vitamin B12 levels may have on the association between homocysteine and preeclampsia (interaction previously reported for other diseases) [25] ; and the second investigated the effect that the recruitment period (included as a year-over-year change) may have on the association of each biomarker with pre-eclampsia. The second method may give some insight of the consequences related to the introduction of folic acid fortification policies or changes in pregnancy care over time within the recruitment period. Interaction terms (in a multiplicative scale) were introduced into the fully adjusted logistic regression models, which were compared against models without the interaction terms using the LRT (24) . A p value lower than 0.05 (p < 0.05) indicated that the nested model with the interaction term had a better fit.Folic acid supplementation and pre-eclampsia. For participants recruited between July 2005 and February 2012, the association of self-reported folic acid supplementation (1 mg/ day) on pre-eclampsia risk was evaluated using logistic regression models. Dummy indicators were generated according to the period of supplementation in trimesters [none (reference), one to two, or three] (S2 Table) . The effect of preconception supplementation was not assessed due to only 0.5% of women reported its consumption. Possible effect modification by recruitment date (included as a year-over-year change) was evaluated with interaction terms tested by the LRT. The validity of self-reported folic acid supplementation was assessed through looking at differences in biomarker levels by categories of the period of supplementation. Adjusting the effect of folic acid supplementation by maternal folate was considered unnecessary since it lies in the causal pathway from exposure to outcome, and the design of the study did not allow evaluating such mediation pathways [26] (S1 Fig). Sub-analysis by pre-eclampsia early vs. late, mild and severe. As a subsidiary analysis, the magnitude of the associations for biomarker levels and folic acid supplementation was evaluated among pre-eclampsia sub-phenotypes in multinomial logistic regression models. In these analyses, subgroups of pre-eclampsia defined by severity (mild and severe cases) and time of onset (late and early pre-eclampsia) were compared simultaneously to the control group. Multinomial logistic regression, an extension of binary logistic regression, was used to estimate the effect of the same risk factor in two pre-eclampsia categories within a single model by allowing to include more than two categories of the outcome variable (mutually exclusive) [27] . Since gestational age defines the presence of early or late pre-eclampsia, it was removed from the models that evaluate the biomarkers and any pre-eclampsia subgroup in order to permit the comparison between estimates.All estimates and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated incorporating the complex design of the sample into the Stata software, version 14 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX).", "citance": "The first evaluated the influence that folate and vitamin B12 levels may have on the association between homocysteine and preeclampsia (interaction previously reported for other diseases) [25] ; and the second investigated the effect that the recruitment period (included as a year-over-year change) may have on the association of each biomarker with pre-eclampsia.", "claims": [{"text": "Folate and vitamin B12 levels influence the association between homocysteine and preeclampsia.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Here we explored the role of the N-end rule pathway in the plant immune response. We investigated the genetic influences of components of the pathway and known protein substrates on physiological, biochemical and metabolic responses to pathogen infection. We show that the glutamine (Gln) deamidation and cysteine (Cys) oxidation branches are both components of the plant immune system, through the E3 ligase PROTEOLYSIS (PRT)6. In Arabidopsis thaliana Gln-specific amino-terminal (Nt)-amidase (NTAQ1) controls the expression of specific defence-response genes, activates the synthesis pathway for the phytoalexin camalexin and influences basal resistance to the hemibiotroph pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato (Pst). The Nt-Cys ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR VII transcription factor substrates enhance pathogen-induced stomatal closure. Transgenic barley with reduced HvPRT6 expression showed enhanced resistance to Ps. japonica and Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei, indicating a conserved role of the pathway. We propose that that separate branches of the N-end rule pathway act as distinct components of the plant immune response in flowering plants.", "citation_paragraph": "Nt-Gln amidase and Cys oxidation branches of the Arg/ N-end rule pathway increase basal resistance against Pst DC3000The role for the Arg/N-end rule pathway in the plant immune response was assessed using the model bacterial pathogen P. syringae pv tomato DC3000 and T-DNA insertion null mutants of the putative Gln-specific amino-terminal amidase NTAQ1 (AT2G41760) and N-recognin E3 ligase PRT6 (AT5G02310) genes, and a premature termination allele of the putative Asn-specific amino-terminal amidase NTAN1 (AT2G44420) (Q202*) (Fig. 1a) . The entire effect of NTAQ1, NTAN1 and Cys branches of the Arg/N-end rule pathway on response to pathogen challenge can be assessed by analysis of the prt6 mutant, as this removes E3 ligase activity, thus stabilizing all substrates of NTAQ1, NTAN1 and substrates with Nt-Cys (Fig. 1a) . Bacterial growth in leaves of prt6 was significantly lower by 4 d post-infiltration with virulent (Pst DC3000) or avirulent (Pst DC3000 avrRmp1) strains, indicating that substrates destabilized by PRT6 action contribute to the immune response (Figs 1b, S2a) . In comparison, ntaq1 alleles also showed significantly lower bacterial growth (comparable with that of prt6 ) compared with both the ntan1-1 mutant or the wild type (WT) Col-0 for plants grown from seed in soil under neutral days (12 h : 12 h, light : dark). These results are opposite to those obtained by de Marchi et al. (2016) , who found enhanced sensitivity to Pst DC3000 of N-end rule mutants prt6 and ate1 ate2 (which removes ATE Nt-arginylation activity, Fig. 1a ). To investigate this difference, we assayed bacterial growth under conditions used by de Marchi et al. for plant growth and infection. In their case, germination and initial 7 d growth of seedlings was carried out on agar containing MS medium and 0.5% sucrose before transfer to soil and, following transfer, plants were grown under short-day conditions (9 h : 15 h, light : dark). We grew Col-0, prt6-1 and ate1 ate2 under these conditions and assayed bacterial growth at 2 d and 4 d post-infiltration. For plants grown under neutral days, we found that by 4 d post-infection, bacterial growth was significantly lower in N-end rule mutants than in the (Fig. S2b) . All subsequent reported experiments were carried out using plants grown from seed under neutral-day conditions.Tissue cellular leakage measured 4 d following infection was significantly lower in prt6 and ntaq1 mutants (Figs 1c, S1d) . Expression in WT of NTAQ1 and PRT6 was not strongly affected by infection with either bacterial strain (Fig. S2c) . Inoculation with the PTI inducer Pst DC3000 hrpA \u00c0 (with a compromised type-three secretion system), resulted in reduced susceptibility of prt6 and ntaq1 mutants compared with WT or ntan1 (Fig. 1d) . Ectopic expression of either Nt-or C-terminally tagged NTAQ1 removed enhanced resistance of ntaq1-3 (Fig. 1e) , and the double mutant prt6-1 ntaq1-3 did not show significant difference compared with the single mutants prt6-1 or ntaq1-3 (Fig. 1f) . It was previously suggested that formation of N-terminal pyroglutamate by glutaminyl cyclase (GC) might compete with NTAQ1 for Nt-Gln substrates (Wang et al., 2009) , implying that a lack of GC activity could lead to enhanced susceptibility. We observed a similar response to Pst DC3000 of WT and a mutant of GLUTAMINYL CYCLASE1 (GC1) (Schilling et al., 2007) (Fig. S2d) , indicating that competition for Nt-Gln substrates between NTAQ1 and GC1 is not relevant for the regulation of bacterial growth following infection. To define the biochemical action of NTAQ1, we analysed the Nt-deamidation capacity of recombinant Arabidopsis NTAQ1 that showed high specificity for Nt-Gln in comparison with NtAsn, -Gly and-Lys (Fig. 1g) .

Bacterial growth 4 d following foliar spray application of Pst DC3000 revealed greater resistance of both prt6-1 and ntaq1-3 mutants compared with WT or ntan1-1 (Figs 2b, S3b) , which for both foliar spray and injection required SA, analysed in double mutant combinations of prt6-1 or ntaq1-3 with sid2-1. SID2 is an isochorismate synthase required for SA synthesis (Nawrath & Metraux, 1999) (Fig. S3c) . Stomatal closure is a key component of early defence response following pathogen attack (Arnaud & Hwang, 2015) . We found that, in response to Pst, WT initially closed and then, induced by the pathogen, reopened its stomata, as did prt6-1 and ntaq1-3. The erfVII and prt6 erfVII mutants failed to close stomata at any point (Fig. 2c) . ERFVIIs have previously been shown to regulate stomatal ABA sensitivity via the Nend rule pathway (Vicente et al., 2017) , and we also found ntaq1-3 stomata were hypersensitive to ABA (Fig. S3d) . In response to Pst DC3000 infection following foliar spray application, resistance was significantly lower in the absence of ERFVII transcription factors (either erfVII or prt6 erfVII) compared with WT or prt6 (Fig. 2d) , respectively. Response to the foliar spray application of Pst DC3000 was associated with a large decrease in activity and expression of NITRATE REDUCTASE (NR) (Fig. 2e,f) . This reduction has been previously linked with increased basal resistance against Pst (Park et al., 2011) , whereas expression of ADH1, a marker for hypoxia, was only increased immediately following pathogen challenge (Fig. S3e) . Infection with Pst DC3000 was associated by 24 h with increased stabilization of an artificial Cys-Arg/N-end rule substrate derived from the construct 35S:MC-HA GUS, that following constitutive MetAP activity is expressed as C-HA GUS (Gibbs et al., 2014b; Vicente et al., 2017) (Fig. 2g) . To clarify whether plant-derived factors were solely responsible for the control of the stability of C-HA GUS, we injected the PAMP peptide flg22, and showed that injection of flg22 was able to stabilize C-HA GUS (Fig. 2h) .", "citance": "It was previously suggested that formation of N-terminal pyroglutamate by glutaminyl cyclase (GC) might compete with NTAQ1 for Nt-Gln substrates (Wang et al., 2009) , implying that a lack of GC activity could lead to enhanced susceptibility.", "claims": [{"text": "Formation of N-terminal pyroglutamate by glutamine cyclase (GC) competes with NTAQ1 for Nt-Gln substrates.", "subject": "glutamine cyclase (GC)", "is_negation": false}]}

It can enter the CNS and act on S1PRs expressed by most neural lineages. Recently, FTY720 neuroprotective and regenerative actions in the CNS have been demonstrated. In the present study, we have investigated whether the PI3K\u2013Akt\u2013FoxO3a axis is downstream to the S1P1 receptor modulation and involved in the cytoprotective effect of FTY720 in PC12 cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The data showed that oxidative stress induces cell death in parallel with a significant decrease in PI3K, Akt and Akt target, and FoxO3a phosphorylation. FTY720 pretreatment increased cell survival which can be attributed to enhanced levels of inactive phosphorylated FoxO3a, a transcription factor playing critical role in oxidative stress-induced cell death. FTY720-phosphate (p-FTY720), a pan agonist of S1P receptors, as well as SEW2871, a selective S1P1 receptor agonist, similarly exerted cytoprotective effects. W123, a S1P1 receptor antagonist, abolished the effects of all three drugs, and concomitant application of DMS, a sphingosine kinase inhibitor, prevented the protective effects of FTY720. The data suggests that S1P1 receptor activation in the context of oxidative stress maintains PI3K/Akt signaling to prevent activation of FoxO3a, thereby promoting PC12 cell survival.", "citation_paragraph": "Several antioxidant mechanisms exist in cells that detoxify generated ROS and thus attenuate cell damage. Under oxidative stress conditions, SOD protects cells by degrading superoxide radicals into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide which is subsequently degraded by CAT activity (Sampayo et al. 2003) . In PC12 cells treated with H 2 O 2 (150 \u03bcM), activities of SOD and CAT were significantly decreased (p<0.001), while pretreatment of the cells with FTY720 (0.1 \u03bcM) and SEW2871 (1 \u03bcM) significantly increased SOD (p<0.05) ( Fig. 2a) and CAT (p<0.001) (Fig. 2b ) activity compared to H 2 O 2 -treated group. Antagonizing the S1P receptor by addition of W123 to drug-treated groups and also addition of DMS to FTY720-treated group reversed all improved SOD and CAT activity level seen in drug-treated groups to that of H 2 O 2 -treated group, again indicating that the importance of S1P1 receptor in FTY720 and SEW2871 mediated improved antioxidant defense of cell. Fig. 2 Determination of SOD and CAT activity. The data of three independent measurements shows that FTY720 (0.1 \u03bcM), SEW2871 (1 \u03bcM), and p-FTY720 (0.01 \u03bcM) treatment significantly increase a SOD and b CAT activity compared to H 2 O 2 -treated PC12 cells. However, all these drug groups show similar trends (in term of enzyme activity) to H 2 O 2 -treated group when combined with W123 (5 \u03bcM) and in the case of FTY720 when also co-treated with DMS (1 \u03bcM).

To assess the potential role of the S1P 1 receptor in regulating PI3K-Akt-FoxO3a axis in response to oxidative stress, we examined the mRNA expression levels as well as total and phosphorylated PI3K (Tyr 458/199), phosphorylated Akt (serine 473), and its downstream target phosphorylated FoxO3a (Ser318/321) protein levels in PC12 cells in response to H 2 O 2 .Quantitative real-time PCR results of three independent experiments confirmed that in none of the experiment sets, the mRNA expression levels of PI3K, Akt, and FoxO3a were significantly altered (Fig. 3) . Total PI3K, Akt, and FoxO3a proteins also remained the same as the control group in all groups with Western blotting (Fig. 4a) . Next, we assessed the levels of phosphorylated to total proteins for them. We observed a significant decrease in the levels of p-PI3K (p<0.001), p-Akt (p<0.05), and p-FoxO3a (p<0.01) following H 2 O 2 treatment (150 \u03bcM), suggesting an activation of PI3K-Akt-FoxO3a axis in response to oxidative stress.While S1P 1 receptor stimulation by FTY720 (0.1 \u03bcM) and p-FTY720 (0.01 \u03bcM) significantly increased the phosphorylated/total level of PI3K on not only in comparison with H 2 O 2 -treated group (p<0.001) but also to that of control (untreated) group (p<0.05), SEW2871 (1 \u03bcM) treatment resulted in an increase of p-PI3K/total PI3K significant only in comparison with H 2 O 2 -treated group (p<0.001) (Fig. 4b) . The effects on p-Akt and p-FoxO3a were similar in all drug groups, and marked increase in p-Akt/total Akt and pFoxO3a/total FoxO3a only in relation with H 2 O 2 -treated group was seen (Fig. 4c, d) .Addition of S1P 1 antagonist, W123 (5 \u03bcM), to drug-treated groups decreased phosphorylated levels of PI3K, Akt, and FoxO3a in different manners, all resembling the results of H 2 O 2 treatment group with the exception of p-PI3K and pAkt for FTY720 plus W123 group in which the phosphorylated levels of indicated proteins were higher than that of H 2 O 2 -treated group (Fig. 4) .In the case of FTY720 plus DMS, the level of p-PI3K/total PI3K, albeit lesser than that of FTY720 alone treatment group, significantly was higher than that of H 2 O 2 treatment group (p<0.01). However, it did not play the same for p-Akt and pFoxO3a, to the extent that the results obtained were likewise that of H 2 O 2 -treated group (Fig. 4) .All together, this data indicates that S1P 1 signaling upon binding to FTY720, p-FTY720, and SEW2871 were able to activate PI3K/Akt/FoxO3a signaling pathway to block H 2 O 2 -induced PC12 cell apoptosis. Discussion S1P-activated GPCRs, S1P 1 -S1P 5 , have been identified as promising molecular targets with therapeutic value (Cusack Salvemini et al. 2013; Schwalm et al. 2014) . Targeting S1P 1 receptor in CNS, in particular, has recently received a bulk of attention, as once activated, it can positively regulate neuronal cell survival/death, along with neurogenesis and synaptic activity (Chi and Nicol 2010; Kanno et al. 2010; Toman et al. 2004 ). FTY720, a sphingosine-like fungal metabolite (Fujita et al. 1994) , is phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase in vivo, and once phosphorylated, p-FTY720 binds to all S1P receptors with the exception of S1PR 2 (Brinkmann et al. 2002) . FTY720 has been reported to preferentially bind to S1P 1 receptor (Aktas et al. 2010) , and upon binding to S1P 1 receptor, it exerts neuroprotective effects and increases neuronal survival (Deogracias et al. 2012; Doi et al. 2013) . Thus, the aim of this study was to explore whether S1P 1 modulators FTY720, p-FTY720, and SEW2871 possess cytoprotective effects on H 2 O 2 -induced injury in PC12 cells and elucidate potential protective mechanisms.Using MTT assay, we quantified cell viability in cells pretreated with FTY720, p-FTY720, and SEW2871, exposed to oxidative injury. Here, both FTY720 and p-FTY720 increased PC12 cell viability during H 2 O 2 -induced oxidative stress. Similar results were obtained with the S1P 1 -selective agonist SEW2871. Inhibition of sphingosine kinases compromised the protective effects of FTY720 on H 2 O 2 -induced cell death, supporting the view that phosphorylated form of this S1P receptors modulator is the bona fide active specious that lowers cell death by affecting S1P receptors (Coelho et al. 2007 ). In addition, the presence of S1P 1 -specific antagonist, W123, abolished all cytoprotective effects of FT720, p-FTY720, and SEW2871, which further confirmed the possibility that S1P 1 receptor signaling cascade is the main receptor involved in the attenuation of oxidative cell injury, observed by these drugs.Activation of PI3K/Akt pathway is downstream to S1P 1 receptor activation (Rutherford et al. 2013) , and Akt signaling following S1P receptors activation has been previously found to promote neuronal survival and exertion of anti-apoptotic effects in many cell types (Hasegawa et al. 2010; Hemmati et al. 2013; Namikawa et al. 2000; Zhao et al. 2006) , while its inhibition has been shown to promote neuronal cell death (Miller et al. 1997 ). In addition, it was stated that activation of FoxO3a, as a target of PI3K-Akt pathway (Brunet et al. 2001) , is detrimental to neurons (Sanphui and Biswas 2013) . Therefore, the potential role of PI3K/Akt/FoxO3a downstream to S1P 1 receptor activation using FTY720, p-FTY720, and SEW2871 was assessed herein. The decreased PI3K and Akt phosphorylation occurring during H 2 O 2 -induced-oxidative stress was prevented by S1P 1 receptor activation. Of note, dephosphorylation/activation of FoxO3a in the context of oxidative stress was also hindered through S1P 1 receptor activation. Our data, in line with previous report (Nakahara et al. 2012) , confirmed the activation of PI3K-Akt following S1P 1 receptor stimulation. Our results also agree and extend previous observations of ROS-mediated FoxO3a activation in neuronal death (Brunet et al. 2004; Lehtinen et al. 2006; van der Horst and Burgering 2007) . Thus, the data presented here provide a new insight into the signaling pathways underlying S1P 1 receptor-mediated cytoprotective mechanism. As illustrated in Fig. 5 , signaling through activation of S1P 1 receptor leads to phosphorylation/ activation of PI3K/Akt and thereby phosphorylation/ inactivation of FoxO3a which in turn results in cytoprotection.The excessive production of ROS can induce oxidation of vital cellular components such as lipids, proteins, and DNA and eventfully either directly or indirectly lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis, and cell death (Chan 2001; Lewen et al. 2000; Sugawara and Chan 2003) . Several endogenous anti-oxidative defense systems, e.g., GPX, SOD, and CAT, can scavenge ROS induced by hydrogen peroxide insult (Iwata et al. 1998 ) and serve therefore as the initial defense line against oxidative stress damage. Consistent with the previous reports on the roles of SOD and CAT (Jackson et al. 1990; Wang et al. 2007) in preventing H 2 O 2 -induced neuronal cell injury, our results showed an improved SOD and CAT activities following pretreatment of PC12 cells with FTY720 and SEW2871. Of note, H 2 O 2 has been previously shown to induce apoptosis in PC12 cells, and antioxidant treatments provide protection against H 2 O 2 -induced cell injury (Cheng et al. 2007; Fujita et al. 2006; Jiang et al. 2007 ). Thus, FTY720-and SEW2871-mediated activation of S1P 1 receptor may provide useful intervention strategy in order to activate SOD and CAT enzymes and thus reduce oxidative stress induced cell injury.In conclusion, the present study provides the evidence of FoxO3a activity following S1P 1 receptor activation. We have demonstrated that FTY720, p-FTY720, and SEW2871 have protective effects against oxidative stress cell injury, likely through a PI3K/Akt/FoxO3a signaling cascade and also increased SOD-CAT activity.", "citance": "Our results also agree and extend previous observations of ROS-mediated FoxO3a activation in neuronal death (Brunet et al. 2004; Lehtinen et al. 2006; van der Horst and Burgering 2007) .", "claims": [{"text": "FoxO3a activation in neuronal death is inhibited by reactive oxygen species (ROS).", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "FoxO3a activation in neuronal death is mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS).", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 3521185, "title": "Paternal age effects on sperm FOXK1 and KCNA7 methylation and transmission into the next generation", "abstract": "Children of older fathers carry an increased risk for developing autism and other disorders. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we investigated the correlation of sperm DNA methylation with paternal age and its impact on the epigenome of the offspring. Methylation levels of nine candidate genes and LINE-1 repeats were quantified by bisulfite pyrosequencing in sperm DNA of 162 donors and 191 cord blood samples of resulting children (conceived by IVF/ICSI with the same sperm samples). Four genes showed a significant negative correlation between sperm methylation and paternal age. For FOXK1 and KCNA7, the age effect on the sperm epigenome was replicated in an independent cohort of 188 sperm samples. For FOXK1, paternal age also significantly correlated with foetal cord blood (FCB) methylation. Deep bisulfite sequencing and allele-specific pyrosequencing allowed us to distinguish between maternal and paternal alleles in FCB samples with an informative SNP. FCB methylation of the paternal FOXK1 allele was negatively correlated with paternal age, whereas maternal allele was unaffected by maternal age. Since FOXK1 duplication has been associated with autism, we studied blood FOXK1 methylation in 74 children with autism and 41 age-matched controls. The FOXK1 promoter showed a trend for accelerated demethylation in the autism group. Dual luciferase reporter assay revealed that FOXK1 methylation influences gene expression. Collectively, our study demonstrates that age-related DNA methylation changes in sperm can be transmitted to the next generation and may contribute to the increased disease risk in offspring of older fathers.", "citation_paragraph": "It becomes increasingly clear that the sperm contributes more to the embryo than just the paternal genome. Sperm DNA methylation and chromatin packaging are thought to epigenetically mark paternal genes that may play an essential role for early embryonic development (25) . In addition, sperm RNA may contribute to embryo development (26) . In the male germ line, DNA methylation marks are established after prenatal mitotic arrest and completed postnatally during meiosis (27, 28) . Exposure to adverse paternal factors during this genome-wide reprogramming phase may influence sperm methylation patterns. The most thoroughly studied paternal factor that has been associated with changes in sperm DNA methylation and histone-protamine configuration is male subfertility (29) (30) (31) .Clinically it is well known that male fertility including sperm production, motility and genome integrity decline with paternal age (32) and, therefore, it is not unexpected that paternal age is also associated with sperm methylation alterations (22) . The sperm transmits epigenetic signatures of paternal age and other factors into the early embryo, where a second reprogramming Table S10 .phase occurs. Most DNA methylation patterns that have been established in the male germ line are erased and replaced by somatic patterns which are identical on both parental chromosomes and mark genes for somatic development (33) . The question how sperm epigenetic signatures can influence further development and have long-lasting effects on the health of the individual remains to be elucidated. A relatively small number of 100-200 imprinted genes escape reprogramming after fertilization and, thus, sperm DNA alterations persist during ontogeny. Therefore, imprinted genes are frequently used as a model to study the epigenetic effects of adverse parental factors and assisted reproductive technologies (30, 34) . However, it is plausible to assume that non-imprinted genes are also involved in transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. Our results suggest that postzygotic reprogramming is incomplete and sperm epigenetic alterations can persist in differentiated somatic cells (at least at the cell population/tissue level) of the next generation. Previously, we observed an association between sperm hypomethylation of ALU repetitive elements and pregnancy loss (35) . Rodent studies revealed that paternal aging affects brain expression and behaviour in the offspring (19, 20) . Our study shows that increased paternal age is associated with reduced sperm methylation of the transcriptional regulator FOXK1 and the potassium channel KCNA7. We exclusively used IVF/ICSI sperm samples (with a wide range of semen parameters) and, therefore, cannot exclude assisted reproduction as a confounding factor. However, the same age-related effect was observed in a previous study on sperm of fertile donors (22) . Interestingly, for both genes sperm samples of young donors showed considerably higher methylation variation with individual sperm methylation ranging from 0 to 100%. Sperm samples of older fathers exhibited reduced variation with the majority of sperm being demethylated. Assuming that sperm samples of younger fathers have a higher potential to achieve a pregnancy and live-birth, sperm methylation variation may have an evolutionary advantage at the population level. For some genes, there may be no optimum methylation status for an individual sperm. Depending on the environmental conditions at fertilization (i.e. pre-or postovulatory age of the oocyte), (epi)genetic background of the mating partner, etc., either methylated or unmethylated sperm (or sperm with methylation values in between) may have the best developmental potential or confer an advantage to the resulting individual. The reduced methylation variation in sperm of old fathers is consistent with 'selfish spermatogonial selection' (36, 37) . De novo alterations that confer a proliferative advantage to the spermatogonial stem cell would lead to the expansion of this cell clone (and consequently sperm carrying this mutation or epimutation).ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by stereotypical behavior, deficits in social interactions and communication (38) . Usually, symptoms start to develop in the second year of life and may aggravate during the following years. Epidemiological studies provide evidence for an increased autism risk in children of older fathers (12, 39, 40) . One plausible explanation for this association is transmission of an adverse paternal factor through sperm to the offspring. Although whole genome sequencing clearly showed that the rate of de novo mutations in offspring increases with paternal age (41), age-related genetic mutations cannot explain much of the increased risk for ASD and other psychiatric disorders (42) . In our opinion, agerelated epigenetic alterations may also contribute to the increased disease risk. ASD and other complex psychiatric disorders manifest when the sum of adverse genetic, epigenetic and/or environmental factors exceeds a critical threshold (43) . By two independent methods, DBS and allele-specific pyrosequencing we showed that paternal age is not only associated with FOXK1 hypomethylation in sperm but also with reduced methylation of the paternal allele in somatic cells (FCB) of the resulting offspring. In contrast, methylation of the maternal allele was not correlated with maternal age. Luciferase assays suggest that this age-related promoter hypomethylation leads to increased gene expression.At the single CpG level, an individual sperm (and also the oocyte) can either transmit an unmethylated or a fully methylated state to the embryo. Therefore, one might expect a 0, 50, or 100% methylation pattern in the zygote and also in the offspring if epigenetic inheritance occurs. However, it is usually the density of methylated CpGs in a cis-regulatory region rather than an individual CpG that turns a gene on or off (44, 45) . Therefore, all our assays including DBS (for single allele analysis) measured the average methylation of several neighboring CpGs in the target region. As shown in Fig. 1 , individual sperm do not only display 0 or 100% methylation at a particular locus but also anything in between. Since older males have a higher percentage of sperm with low methylation values, the fertilized eggs are more likely endowed with a hypomethylated paternal allele, compared to younger males. Irrespective of the methylation status of the fertilizing sperm, the transmitted paternal allele is influenced by genome-wide epigenetic reprogramming after fertilization, developmental and differentiation processes. Nevertheless, at a population level when comparing cord blood methylation in children conceived by old versus young fathers we can still detect an epigenetic signature of paternal age during ontogeny. Children from old fathers who more often developed from a zygote with a hypomethylated sperm display a slightly reduced methylation in the paternal FOXK1 allele. However, in this context, it is important to emphasize that both children from old and young fathers display enormous methylation variation and the distributions largely overlap. The methylation change due to paternal age is much smaller than the variation between individuals. Thus, age effects can only be detected at the population level.FOXK1 (forkhead box K1) encodes a transcription factor of the forkhead family which has a known role in the activation of myogenic progenitor cells and skeletal muscle regeneration (46) . The more than 40 members of the forkhead family are involved in the regulation of gene expression in embryonic development, metabolism, cell-cycle control, and cancer. Foxk1 and Foxk2 regulate autophagy and atrophy genes in muscle cells and fibroblasts (47) . Foxk1 knockout mice are viable, but runted, and suffer from skeletal muscle atrophy and impaired satellite cell function (48) . On the other hand, FOX genes such as FOXP1 and FOXP2 have been associated with autism and specific language impairment (49) (50) (51) . A CNV array study (24) demonstrated microduplications of the FOXK1 region in 2 out of 23 ASD patients. As expected for an ASD gene (18, 52) , FOXK1 methylation is highly dynamic during foetal brain development. We found that FOXK1 FCB demethylation is accelerated in autistic individuals during the first years of life (2-5 years). However, due to the relatively small sample size and the high methylation dynamics after birth, there is only a trend (P \u00bc 0.07) difference between ASD subjects and controls. Larger follow-up studies are necessary to validate this effect. A recent 450K methylation array study on adult cortex identified several CpG sites, including 5 in the FOXK1 gene body, which displayed significant methylation differences between autistic and control subjects (17) . This further strengthens the possible role of FOXK1 methylation in the development of autism. Considering its function in myogenic progenitor and muscle cells, FOXK1 deregulation may also be associated with clumsiness and hypotonia, which is often observed in young children with autism (38) .The KCNA7 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily A member 7) gene has been implicated in cardiac disorders and sperm volume regulation (53, 54) . Voltage gated potassium channels are crucial for the electrical excitability of nerve and muscle fibres, and have been associated with ASD (55-57). We identified a DMR in the CTCF binding site (ENSR00000641867) close to the KCNA7 promoter which was hypomethylated in sperm and resulting offspring of older males. Unfortunately, DBS analysis of the paternal allele in FCB did not yield a significant age effect due to the low number of informative samples with a heterozygous SNP.", "citance": "Foxk1 and Foxk2 regulate autophagy and atrophy genes in muscle cells and fibroblasts (47) .", "claims": [{"text": "Foxk1 regulates atrophy genes in muscle cells and fibroblast cells.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Foxk1 regulates autophagy genes in muscle cells and fibroblast cells.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Foxk2 regulates autophagy genes in muscle cells and fibroblast cells.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 8821999, "title": "The conformational flexibility of the C-terminus of histone H4 promotes histone octamer and nucleosome stability and yeast viability", "abstract": "BACKGROUND The protein anti-silencing function 1 (Asf1) chaperones histones H3/H4 for assembly into nucleosomes every cell cycle as well as during DNA transcription and repair. Asf1 interacts directly with H4 through the C-terminal tail of H4, which itself interacts with the docking domain of H2A in the nucleosome. The structure of this region of the H4 C-terminus differs greatly in these two contexts.   RESULTS To investigate the functional consequence of this structural change in histone H4, we restricted the available conformations of the H4 C-terminus and analyzed its effect in vitro and in vivo in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. One such mutation, H4 G94P, had modest effects on the interaction between H4 and Asf1. However, in yeast, flexibility of the C-terminal tail of H4 has essential functions that extend beyond chromatin assembly and disassembly. The H4 G94P mutation resulted in severely sick yeast, although nucleosomes still formed in vivo albeit yielding diffuse micrococcal nuclease ladders. In vitro, H4G4P had modest effects on nucleosome stability, dramatically reduced histone octamer stability, and altered nucleosome sliding ability.   CONCLUSIONS The functional consequences of altering the conformational flexibility in the C-terminal tail of H4 are severe. Interestingly, despite the detrimental effects of the histone H4 G94P mutant on viability, nucleosome formation was not markedly affected in vivo. However, histone octamer stability and nucleosome stability as well as nucleosome sliding ability were altered in vitro. These studies highlight an important role for correct interactions of the histone H4 C-terminal tail within the histone octamer and suggest that maintenance of a stable histone octamer in vivo is an essential feature of chromatin dynamics.", "citation_paragraph": "Due to the intrinsic conformational flexibility of glycine, the C-terminal tail of histone H4 is predicted to have a wide range of orientations. Substitution of the glycine with alanine restricts this flexibility somewhat, while substitution with proline limits this conformational freedom even further. The effects of this change in flexibility in vivo are dramatic. Although the H4G94A mutation is well tolerated by yeast, the H4G94P mutation is not, and leads to an altered cell cycle profile and inviability after two or three cell divisions (Figures 2 and 3) .The G94P H4 is compatible with the formation of an Asf1-H3/H4 complex. The Gly 94 phi and psi angles, of \u221252.5\u00b0and 145\u00b0, in the complex of H3/H4 G94P , differ from those in the WT Asf1-H3/H4 complex (75.4\u00b0and \u2212175\u00b0) [23] , but the Asf1-H3/H4G94P structure was only slightly distorted compared to the WT (Figure 4 ). Although the binding affinity was not altered by this H4 substitution in vitro, Asf1 sequesters H4 G94P to a greater degree than WT H4 in vivo ( Figure 5 ). If sequestration of the histone by a chaperone was the origin of the mutant phenotype, then deletion of the gene encoding the chaperone should rescue the mutant, as was previously shown for the histone chaperone Rtt106 and other histone H4 mutants [32] . However, neither deletion nor overexpression of ASF1 improved the growth of the G94P mutant (data not shown). Further, if the reason for the H4G94P mutant phenotype is due to histone sequestration by Asf1 or other chaperones, the mutant should be dominant over WT H4, which it is not.Unexpectedly, we found reduced total histone levels in the H4G94P mutant, along with minor alterations in the MNase accessibility and genomic occupancy of histones. These results were obtained consistently with two sets of strains from two different genetic backgrounds. Possible explanations for these observations include the unlikely possibility that there is differential specificity of the H3 antibody in western blotting and ChIP analyses. Alternatively, it is possible that only a subset of histones, perhaps those that are tightly bound within nucleosomes, are monitored by the MNase accessibility and ChIP analyses, and that there is a looser subset of histones that are invisible to these assays that are absent in the H4G94P mutant. Precedent for this idea is provided by mutants of Asf1 and the Rtt109 histone acetyl transferase, which are more resistant to MNase digestion than WT cells [45, 46] and have a higher histone occupancy by ChIP analysis (data not shown). However, over half of the histones in an asf1 mutant are either not chromatin associated or are easily extracted from DNA in low amounts of detergent [47] . In vitro, nucleosome stability was reduced for NCPs containing H3/H4 G94P , while in yeast, H3/H4 occupancy on the DNA as determined by ChIP and MNase accessibility was not significantly reduced in the H4G94P mutant. This discrepancy is likely due to the formaldehyde fixation step preceding the MNase and ChIP assays, which likely retains the structure of the nucleosomes.Why is the H4G94P mutant inviable in yeast? This could be due to the substantially decreased levels of histones in this mutant. It is possible that the H4G94P mutation renders the histones more likely to be degraded due to having an altered conformation. If the H4 G94P protein impedes chromatin assembly, it may lead to an increase in free histones that are subsequently degraded via a Rad53-dependent mechanism following DNA replication [48] . However, we are not convinced that an inadequate supply of histones explains the inviability of the H4G94P mutant, because additional H4 G94P supplied from a high copy plasmid, did not improve viability or growth compared to additional H4 G94P supplied from a low copy plasmid (data not shown).Although the steady state of chromatin structure in the H4G94P mutant does not appear to be greatly disrupted per se (from the MNase and ChIP analysis), it is possible that the rates of histone removal and assembly are altered in the H4G94P mutant in vivo. This could be due to reduced amounts of histones feeding into the chromatin assembly pathway because they remain bound to other histone chaperones. Alternatively, the conformational flexibility in the H4 C-terminus might be important for the disassembly of histones from chromatin or remodeling of nucleosomes. We consistently saw that the H4G94P mutants had diffuse nucleosomal ladders ( Figure 7B ), indicative of either rapid repositioning or random spacing of the nucleosomes within the cell population. However, if the H4G94P nucleosomes were rapidly repositioning, there should be an increased accessibility to MNase, which was not observed. Therefore, we suggest that H4G94P containing nucleosomes are not accurately spaced on the yeast genome. Even spacing of nucleosomes along the genome requires ATPdependent nucleosome remodelers. It is noteworthy, therefore, that the terminal phenotypes of certain conditional mutants of the essential Sth1 ATPase subunit of the RSC ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeler are reminiscent of those of the H4G94P mutant [49] . Indeed, we found that the nucleosomes formed with the H4G94P mutant were remodeled less efficiently than WT H3/H4 containing nucleosomes ( Figure 9A,B) .Distortions due to the G94P substitution did not prevent NCP formation in vitro (Figure 8 ), but led to NCPs that were slightly destabilized relative to WT. More importantly histone octamers were not even formed with the H4 G94P mutant. The C-terminal tail of H4 forms a parallel \u03b2 sheet with H2A in the nucleosome, which is involved in the docking of H2A/H2B dimers to the H3/H4 tetrasome. This is one of several contacts between the H2A/H2B dimer and H3/H4, which cooperate to stabilize the nucleosome. SWI/ SNF ('SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable') independent (SIN) mutants of H2A and H3 [50] , which are located near the DNA, and not at the interface between H4 and H2A, do not have the severity of functional or physical defects as H4 G94P [51, 52] . However, the deletion of the H4 C-terminal tail from 97 to 102, but not 100 to 102, causes lethality in yeast [53] , which suggests that there is an important interaction that is altered by the H4G94P mutation. H4 Y98 lies at the H4-H2A interface and could easily be influenced by the H4G94P substitution. Indeed, Y98 substitution mutants have a range of phenotypic severity from lethality to viability [53, 54] , and the H4Y98H temperature sensitive mutant fails to form histone octamers [51] .The histone octamers formed with H4 G94P and H4", "citance": "If the H4 G94P protein impedes chromatin assembly, it may lead to an increase in free histones that are subsequently degraded via a Rad53-dependent mechanism following DNA replication [48] .", "claims": [{"text": "Free histones are degraded by a Rad53-dependent mechanism once DNA has been replicated.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Free histones are synthesized by a Rad53-dependent mechanism once DNA has been replicated.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "H4 G94P proteins induce chromatin assembly, which increases free histones.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "H4 G94P proteins induce degradation of free histones via Rad53-dependent mechanisms.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "H4 G94P proteins inhibit chromatin assembly, which decreases free histones.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "H4 G94P proteins suppress degradation of free histones via Rad53-dependent mechanisms.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}

In each instance, dysregulation of normal stem cell function is thought to contribute to the disease phenotype [2] . Moreover, stem cell characteristics are modulated by a variety of developmental pathways and regulators. MDS are clonal hematopoietic disorders characterized by in inefficient hematopoiesis and frequent progression to AML [3] . Even in low-risk MDS, clonal hematopoiesis already dominates at diagnosis, and clonal hematopoiesis and clones found in secondary AML originate from the MDS stage of disease [3] , highlighting the need to specifically targeted the MDS-initiating clone. Although massive parallel sequencing studies have revealed a number of genomic alterations associated with MDS, functional consequence of these alterations remain poorly understood, mainly due to a difficulty in the ex vivo culture of primary MDS cells and lack of appropriate animal model [4] . The discovery of key transcription factors enabling reprograming a somatic cell into a pluripotent stem cell, called induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) open new avenues in medicine [5] [6] [7] .

{"s2orc_id": 2792997, "title": "Planar Cell Polarity Signaling in Collective Cell Movements During Morphogenesis and Disease", "abstract": "Collective and directed cell movements are crucial for diverse developmental processes in the animal kingdom, but they are also involved in wound repair and disease. During these processes groups of cells are oriented within the tissue plane, which is referred to as planar cell polarity (PCP). This requires a tight regulation that is in part conducted by the PCP pathway. Although this pathway was initially characterized in flies, subsequent studies in vertebrates revealed a set of conserved core factors but also effector molecules and signal modulators, which build the fundamental PCP machinery. The PCP pathway in Drosophila regulates several developmental processes involving collective cell movements such as border cell migration during oogenesis, ommatidial rotation during eye development, and embryonic dorsal closure. During vertebrate embryogenesis, PCP signaling also controls collective and directed cell movements including convergent extension during gastrulation, neural tube closure, neural crest cell migration, or heart morphogenesis. Similarly, PCP signaling is linked to processes such as wound repair, and cancer invasion and metastasis in adults. As a consequence, disruption of PCP signaling leads to pathological conditions. In this review, we will summarize recent findings about the role of PCP signaling in collective cell movements in flies and vertebrates. In addition, we will focus on how studies in Drosophila have been relevant to our understanding of the PCP molecular machinery and will describe several developmental defects and human disorders in which PCP signaling is compromised. Therefore, new discoveries about the contribution of this pathway to collective cell movements could provide new potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets for these disorders.", "citation_paragraph": "Body axis elongation and neural tube closure are two essential developmental processes that occur during embryogenesis. Both involve cell movements and take place through the convergent extension (CE) mechanism, which has been shown to be controlled by the PCP pathway [37] . CE is understood as the narrowing and lengthening of a group of cells. In this complex process, cells elongate mediolaterally and produce polarized cellular protrusions that enable them to move directionally and to intercalate with other neighboring cells [37] [38] [39] . This change in shape and movement results in convergence of the cells towards the midline and extension of the tissue along the AP axis. As a consequence, the body axis elongates and the neural tube closes. Then alterations of the CE process lead to defects in both the general body plan and the formation of the neural tube. Other examples of coordinated cell movements regulated by PCP signaling can be found during embryogenesis such as those occurring during eyelid closure, yolk sac formation, and mouse ventral endoderm migration (see below).Early failure of neural tube closure during embryonic development gives rise to congenital malformations of the central nervous system known as neural tube defects (NTDs) [40] . These defects can affect both the cranial and/or spinal regions of the developing spinal cord [40] , and manifest most commonly as anencephaly and/or spina bifida. Neurulation is conserved between mammalian species [41] ; therefore, animal models have been instrumental in deciphering the complex molecular mechanisms underlying NTDs [42] and have demonstrated the essential role of the PCP signaling pathway in this process. The mouse mutant loop-tail (Lp) was the first model that implicated a PCP core gene in the pathogenesis of NTDs [43, 44] . Lp mice carry mutations in the vang-like 2 (Vangl2) gene [43, 44] and homozygous mutant embryos manifested craniorachischisis, a severe form of NTD characterized by failure in neural tube formation along the entire body axis [45] . Additionally, several studies in vertebrate models have analyzed the effect of mutations in other PCP signaling components like the fz homologs Fzd3 and Fzd6, the fmi homolog Celsr1, the dsh homologs Dvl1, Dvl2, Dvl3, or the pk homolog Prickle1. These mutants present shorter and wider neural plates than wild-type animals and display craniorachischisis, thus confirming the role of PCP signaling during neural tube closure in vertebrates (reviewed in [46] ). Moreover, since CE also affects the final body plan, these mutants displayed a shortened AP axis with concomitant expansion of the mediolateral axis (Fig. 3A-G) . It is noteworthy that screens in patients or fetuses with NTDs in humans have identified missense mutations in VANGL2, VANGL1, PRICKLE1, CELSR1 and FZD6 [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] . Some of these studies have analyzed the functional consequences of these mutations. For example, mutations in VANGL1 have Human, mouse Reviewed in [12] , [140] , [149] , [151] , [154] , [156] been shown to affect in some cases the physical interaction of VANGL1 with the DVL proteins, which is central in PCP signaling [51] [52] [53] , thus indicating that VANGL1 is a risk factor in human NTDs. Moreover, subcellular localization experiments revealed that specific mutations in CELSR1 produced a dramatic reduction of the protein localization to the membrane, a feature that characterizes wild type proteins and is known to be required for PCP pathway function [50] . It is interesting to mention that CCMs that occur during eyelid formation are similar to those occurring in neural tube closure, being this process also controlled by PCP signaling [54] [55] [56] .Another critical step during mammalian embryogenesis is yolk sac formation since it provides nutrients and gas exchange to the embryo prior to establishment of the placenta. Without proper yolk sac formation, the embryo either dies or its growth is stunted. Parietal endoderm (PE) migration along the inner surface of the trophectoderm is essential for parietal yolk sac formation. This migration occurs in a manner reminiscent of CE. F9 teratocarcinoma cells provide a convenient in vitro model system to study the migration of PE cells [57] . Interestingly, data obtained using F9 cells suggested that the PCP pathway, acting via RHOA/ROCK, regulates oriented cell migration of PE [58] , thus involving PCP signaling from the first steps of mammalian embryogenesis in extraembryonic tissues. Finally, recent results show that the formation of multi-cellular rosettes in the mouse ventral endoderm during embryogenesis is also dependent on PCP signaling [59] . Computational simulations showed that the formation of these rosettes is essential for the stereotypic migration of the anterior ventral endoderm, a specialized group of cells responsible for specifying the embryonic anterior pattern [59] .One of the hallmarks of PCP signaling is the asymmetric arrangement of PCP core components with respect to the global axis of the epithelium, originally described in Drosophila (see Introduction). This distribution allows cell polarity establishment within the plane of the epithelium, which promotes the rearrangement of cytoskeletal components and translates in directed cell movement like CE. Although subcellular localization of PCP core components has been difficult to determine during CE, studies in animal models have enabled to obtain some data. The asymmetric distribution of PRICKLE1 in the neural plate, determined by inmunohistochemical analyses, has been shown to be essential for neural tube closure in mice [60] . In addition, the use of fluorescent fusion proteins has allowed to determine that Pk localizes at the anterior cell edge during dorsal mesoderm CE movements in zebrafish, whereas Dsh is enriched posteriorly [61] . Similar analyses showed Fz/PCP-dependent Pk localization to the membrane on the anterior side of cells in the notochord and neuroectoderm during zebrafish neurulation [62] . The asymmetric localization of Pk and Dsh observed in zebrafish gastrula is similar to the situation described in flies, suggesting that PCP signaling defines distinct anterior and posterior cell properties to drive cell intercalations during CE. In addition, the importance of misshapen-like kinase 1 (mink1)-dependent pk phosphorylation and rab5-dependent endosomal trafficking for its plasma membrane accumulation and for vangl-pk complex establishment and function during CE has been recently reported in Xenopus embryos [63] . Interestingly a genetic interaction between pk and misshapen (msn), the Drosophila ortholog of mink1, has been reported in the eye [63] where an endocytic mechanism is also important for regulation of Fmi levels in cell membranes during OR. There is also evidence that the PCP pathway is involved in the localized assembly of extracellular matrix (ECM) and in cell adhesion in vertebrates. Cellcell/cell-ECM interactions are in turn necessary for the oriented, polarized cell movements required for proper CE and other CCMs (reviewed in [64, 65] ). Regarding this, it has been demonstrated that Vangl2 affects the cytoskeleton and cell adhesion in mouse embryonic neural plate and/or tube. Moreover, the PCP effector RAC1 GTPase plays a key role in this process, so that both a defective and excessive recruitment of RAC1 by VANGL2 produce cytoskeletal abnormalities and impaired adhesion, as it has been shown in cell aggregation and scratch assays using HEK293T, MDCK and C17.2 neural stem cells (65) . Thus the correct function of PCP signaling via regulation of VANGL2 levels and its interaction with RAC1 is central for appropriate cell adhesion and neural tube development [66] . Moreover, data obtained in studies of Xenopus gastrulation using morpholinos to knockdown genes of interest suggest that localization of the cytoskeleton-related proteins septin 2 and 7 is regulated by the PCP protein fritz, being a crucial control point for CCM [67] and thus linking PCP signaling to cytoskeleton organization via septin proteins during the CE process. Regarding regulation of PCP signaling during CE, it has been shown that several genes can affect PCP signaling at different steps, from regulation of gene transcription to control of protein localization [60, 63, [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] . As an example, we already mentioned that mink regulates pk trafficking in Xenopus (see above). Moreover, mice mutant for SMAD ubiquitination regulatory factor 1 (Smurf1) and Smurf2 display defects that include a failure in neural tube closure as well as CE defects in the cochlea (see following section). Smurfs have been also shown to participate in PRICKLE1 targeting for ubiquitin-mediated degradation, thus uncovering an unexpected role for SMURF E3 ubiquitin-ligases in controlling PRICKLE1 asymmetrical distribution and hence the dynamic use of the PCP pathway in a local manner during CE [60] .", "citance": "Similar analyses showed Fz/PCP-dependent Pk localization to the membrane on the anterior side of cells in the notochord and neuroectoderm during zebrafish neurulation [62] .", "claims": [{"text": "Fz/PCP-dependent Pk localizes to the anterior membrane of neuroectoderm cells during zebrafish neuralation", "subject": "Fz/PCP-dependent Pk", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Fz/PCP-dependent Pk localizes to the anterior membrane of notochord cells during zebrafish neuralation.", "subject": "Fz/PCP-dependent Pk", "is_negation": false}]}

To examine the effect of GATA-3 deficiency on ILC development after the ALP stage, we examined EILPs and ILCps by TCF-1 intracellular staining and used ALP absolute numbers to normalize EILP and ILCp numbers in Vav1-iCre Gata3 +/+ and Vav1-iCre Gata3 f/f mice. EILPs were detectable and expressed normal levels of \u03b14\u03b27 in Vav1-iCre Gata3 f/f mice (Fig. 6, A and B) .

USP21 is known to deubiquitinate transcription factor GATA3 and death-domain kinase RIPK1 in vitro, however the in vivo settings where this regulation plays a biologically significant role remain unknown. In order to determine whether USP21 is an essential and non-redundant regulator of GATA3 or RIPK1 activity in vivo, we characterized Usp21-deficient mice, focusing on mouse viability and development, hematopoietic stem cell function, and lymphocyte differentiation. The Usp21-knockout mice were found to be viable and fertile, with no significant dysmorphology, in contrast to the GATA3 and RIPK1 knockout lines that exhibit embryonic or perinatal lethality. Loss of USP21 also had no effect on hematopoietic stem cell function, lymphocyte development, or the responses of antigen presenting cells to TLR and TNFR stimulation. GATA3 levels in hematopoietic stem cells or T lymphocytes remained unchanged. We observed that aged Usp21-knockout mice exhibited spontaneous T cell activation, however this was not linked to altered GATA3 levels in the affected cells. The contrast in the phenotype of the Usp21-knockout line with the previously characterized GATA3 and RIPK1 knockout mice strongly indicates that USP21 is redundant for the regulation of GATA3 and RIPK1 activity during mouse development, in hematopoietic stem cells, and in lymphocyte differentiation. The Usp21-deficient mouse line characterized in this study may serve as a useful tool for the future characterization of USP21 physiological functions.", "citation_paragraph": "USP21 is a member of the ubiquitin specific protease (USP) family of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) [1, 2] . It can catalyze the proteolysis of a variety of ubiquitin chains, including K6-, K11-, K29-, K48-, K63-and linear ubiquitin conjugates [3] . It is also reported to degrade conjugates of ubiquitin-like protein ISG15 [3] , and according to some reports NEDD8 [4] .Identification of the physiological protein substrates that are deubiquitinated by USP21 remains challenging. USP21 was originally demonstrated to remove ubiquitin from histone H2A (H2AK119ub), with strong specificity for nucleosomal rather than free histone substrates [5] . This activity was suggested to promote transcriptional activation, especially in mouse hepatocytes during liver regeneration [5] . Subsequently two splice isoforms of USP21 protein were identified [6] , and the short isoform was shown to localize primarily to the nucleus and the nuclear membrane, and to function as a deubiquitinase for histone H2A [6] . In contrast the long isoform of USP21 was shown to localize to the cytosol and associate with microtubules [7, 8] . Several other substrates of USP21 were identified, namely transcription factor GATA3, deathdomain containing protein kinase RIPK1 [9, 10] , and most recently the anti-viral pattern recognition receptor RIG-I and cytokine IL-33 [11, 12] . Specifically, USP21 was shown to deubiquitinate and stabilize GATA3 in vitro and in cell lines, promoting GATA3 transcriptional activity [10] . In contrast, USP21 acted as a negative regulator of RIPK1, inhibiting its activity downstream of TNF\u03b1 receptor 1 (TNFR1), and therefore suppressing signaling through the NF\u03baB pathway and inflammatory cytokine production [9] .GATA3 is a zinc finger transcription factor essential for normal embryonic development in mouse models, and GATA3-deficient mouse embryos die at day 11.5 dpc with severe abnormalities in the nervous system, kidneys, vasculature, and fetal hematopoiesis [13] . GATA3 is also essential for hematopoietic and immune systems in the adult mouse. Thus GATA3 regulates cell cycle progression and self-renewal capacity of bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) [14, 15] . GATA3 also plays a critical role at all stages of T cell development in the thymus [16, 17] , and in the functions of Th2-polarized effector T cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs) [18, 19, 20] .RIPK1 is a serine/threonine kinase with a C-terminal death-domain. It is a critical component of the signaling pathways mediating NF\u03baB activation, inflammatory cytokine production, and cell death through necroptosis, downstream of receptors TNFR1, TLR3, TLR4, TRAIL-R1/ R2, Fas and others [21, 22, 23] . RIPK1 activity is regulated through ubiquitination, including K63-polyubiquitination that mediates downstream NF\u03baB activation, and K48-polyubiquitination that targets RIPK1 for proteasome-dependent degradation [24, 25] . Stringent regulation of RIPK1 activity is essential for mammalian development, viability, and immune functions. RIPK1-deficient cells are hyper-susceptible to TNF\u03b1-induced apoptosis, and RIPK1-knockout mice die at days 1-3 after birth, due high levels of cell death in many tissues, including immune and lymphoid organs [26, 27] . Similarly, increased RIPK1 levels and activity, which occur for example in a FADD-deficient mouse line, result in lethality with elevated levels of necrosis, as well as impaired T cell proliferation [28, 29] .USP21 is also known to hydrolyze conjugates of the ubiquitin-like protein ISG15 [3] , however the specific protein substrates the ISG15-conjugation state of which is modulated by USP21 have not been identified. Importantly, ISG15 is strongly induced in response to type-I interferons (IFNs), and ISG15-conjugation of multiple protein substrates plays an essential role in the mammalian immune responses to infections [30, 31, 32] . For example, ISG15-deficiency in humans is linked with increased susceptibility to Mycobacterial infections [32] , while deficiency in ISG15-specific protease Ubp43 in mouse models results in increased resistance to S. typhimurium challenge [30] . The possible roles of USP21 in immune responses to bacterial infection currently remain untested.In summary, although USP21 was shown to modulate the ubiquitination state, stability and activity of GATA3 and RIPK1 in vitro and in cell lines [9, 10] , the in vivo settings where this regulation plays a biologically significant role remain unknown. Here we characterize a Usp21-deficient mouse line and observe no gross abnormalities in overall morphology, hematopoietic stem cell maintenance, lymphocyte differentiation, or resistance to bacterial challenge, suggesting that USP21 is redundant as a regulator of GATA3 or RIPK1 functions in these settings.", "citance": "Thus GATA3 regulates cell cycle progression and self-renewal capacity of bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) [14, 15] .", "claims": [{"text": "GATA3 regulates cell cycle progression and the self-renewal capacity of bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "GATA3 regulates cell cycle progression in bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "GATA3 regulates self-renewal capacity in bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

The etiopathogenesis is largely unknown in dogs, whereas in humans GC often develops from gastric mucosal metaplasia and dysplasia. This study investigates whether dogs of certain breeds are more often subject to gastroduodenoscopy (GDS), and diagnosed with GC, mucosal metaplasia or dysplasia. A retrospective clinical database search was performed at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital at the University of Helsinki, Finland. The following inclusion criteria were applied to estimate relative risk for metaplasia/dysplasia and GC: dogs from pure breeds with at least five individuals subject to GDS with histopathology of gastric biopsies.   RESULTS Between 2006 and 2016, from a total of 54945 canine patients presented, 423 dogs underwent GDS. Inclusion criteria were met in 180 dogs of 20 different pure breeds. Eight dogs had GCs (mean age = 9.8 \u00b1 1.7 years): Belgian Tervuren (n = 4), Collie (n = 2), Golden Retriever (n = 1) and Jack Russel Terrier (n = 1). Fourteen dogs of eight breeds had gastric mucosal metaplasia or dysplasia. A log-binomial statistical model revealed that dogs in the following breeds had a significantly higher probability to undergo GDS than the others in the study population: Australian Terrier, Belgian Tervuren, Cairn Terrier, Collie and Siberian Husky. Belgian Tervuren was found at higher risk to be diagnosed with GC [RR = 19 (5.7-63.9; P < 0.0001)], as well as mucosal metaplasia/dysplasia [RR (7.6; 2.95-19.58; P < 0.0001)], as compared to the other breeds included. Shetland Sheepdog had an increased RR (5.83; 1.75-19.45; P = 0.0041) for metaplasia.   CONCLUSIONS The results indicate a very low incidence of GC in dogs. The Belgian Tervuren, however, appears as predisposed. The histopathologic descriptions of mucosal changes such as metaplasia and dysplasia were also rare, but were more frequent in the Belgian Tervuren. Previous reports of these changes in dogs are very scarce, but they might be presumably related to GC in dogs, as they are in humans. Future research should investigate the possible role of metaplasia and dysplasia in the development of GC in dogs, especially those of predisposed breeds.", "citation_paragraph": "Gastric carcinoma (GC) is a rare pathologic finding in dogs, as it corresponds to less than one percent of all neoplastic changes identified in dogs [1, 2] . The most common type of gastric neoplasm in dogs is adenocarcinoma, which is diagnosed at around 10 years of age, with initial clinical signs similar to those of other chronic gastrointestinal disorders [2] [3] [4] [5] . Most gastrointestinal carcinomas in humans are known to evolve from superficial, flat changes classified as metaplastic or dysplastic according to their degree of cellular differentiation [6, 7] . GC is the fifth most common type of cancer in people worldwide, and endoscopic biopsy is essential for diagnostic and staging [8] . Visual enhancement techniques such as chromoendoscopy and narrow band imaging are often applied for cancer screening and surveillance, as they can help improve the diagnostic yield of discrete mucosal changes [9] . The pathogenesis in humans is complex and not fully understood, but in approximately 90% of the cases it involves a multistep, multifactorial process. The progression from normal mucosa to chronic gastritis, further evolving to atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia and adenocarcinoma, occurs over several years [10] . However, challenging this classic histogenetic pathway in which metaplasia and dysplasia are well-recognized pre-neoplastic changes, human GC can also develop from otherwise normal gastric mucosa. Diffuse gastric cancer, for example, is rare and often develops in a hereditary setting from foci of superficial signet ring carcinoma in situ [11] . Gastric infection with Helicobacter pylori plays a major role among environmental factors contributing to an increased risk of gastric cancer in humans [12] , along with dietary factors including high intake of salt and preserved or smoked food (especially meat products), and low consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables [13] .The etiology of GC in dogs is still unknown, and it is suspected to be as complex as in humans [14] . The cardinal histological changes in canine gastric carcinogenesis remain undetermined, and the correlation between gastric polyps, Helicobacter spp. and GC has not yet been demonstrated [5, 15, 16] . A study on 14 Norwegian Lundehund dogs describes findings of mucous metaplasia in association with varying degrees of atrophic gastritis and intestinal lymphangiectasia. Additionally, four of those dogs had gastric neoplasia, which suggests that the changes represent a single pathological process [17] . In a further study with a total of eight Lundehunds with gastric neoplasia, it seems that such tumors are rather of neuroendocrine origin (derived from enterochromaffin-like-cells), possibly secondary to gastric atrophy and hypergastrinemia [18] . However, canine GC is not always associated with atrophic gastritis and comprehensive studies demonstrating the progression of atrophy towards metaplasia, dysplasia and gastric cancer in dogs are still lacking.Previous retrospective studies based on data from canine cancer registry, records from specialists, pathology laboratories and breeders have shown breed predisposition to GC in the Belgian Tervuren, Bouvier des Flandres, Groenendael, Collie, Chow-Chow, Poodle, Norwegian Elkhound and a few other breeds, which implies a genetic background for the disease [1, 3, 4, 19, 20] . In Finland, information about breed association to gastric cancer has been missing.The present study was conducted to investigate which pure breeds are most commonly subject to gastroduodenoscopy (GDS) at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of the University of Helsinki, a national referral center. The most important objective was to determine the probability of dogs in different breeds undergoing endoscopy with mucosal biopsy for histology to be diagnosed with gastric carcinoma, metaplasia or dysplasia, as a possible evidence of breed predisposition also in Finland. The overall aim of this study was to gather information about gastric cancer and metaplastic or dysplastic changes as recognizable features in canine patients undergoing endoscopy with gastric mucosal biopsy for histology. This study relies on the hypothesis that, in the clinical setting of an endoscopic unit, certain breeds can be found affected with GC and mucosal metaplasia/dysplasia more commonly than others. The study therefore aims at investigating a possible association between individual breed, submission to GDS, and diagnosis of gastric carcinoma and metaplastic or dysplastic mucosal changes in histopathology.", "citance": "Gastric infection with Helicobacter pylori plays a major role among environmental factors contributing to an increased risk of gastric cancer in humans [12] , along with dietary factors including high intake of salt and preserved or smoked food (especially meat products), and low consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables [13] .The etiology of GC in dogs is still unknown, and it is suspected to be as complex as in humans [14] .", "claims": [{"text": "Gastric infection with Helicobacter pylori decreases risk of gastric cancer in humans.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Gastric infection with Helicobacter pylori increases risk of gastric cancer in humans.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 469102, "title": "Transcriptional control of early T and B cell developmental choices.", "abstract": "T and B cells share a common somatic gene rearrangement mechanism for assembling the genes that code for their antigen receptors; they also have developmental pathways with many parallels. Shared usage of basic helix-loop-helix E proteins as transcriptional drivers underlies these common features. However, the transcription factor networks in which these E proteins are embedded are different both in membership and in architecture for T and B cell gene regulatory programs. These differences permit lineage commitment decisions to be made in different hierarchical orders. Furthermore, in contrast to B cell gene networks, the T cell gene network architecture for effector differentiation is sufficiently modular so that E protein inputs can be removed. Complete T cell-like effector differentiation can proceed without T cell receptor rearrangement or selection when E proteins are neutralized, yielding natural killer and other innate lymphoid cells.", "citation_paragraph": "To block access to the T cell program in B-cell precursors, B cell regulatory factors must target the functions that distinguish the T-cell network from the B cell program. They cannot attack E proteins, since these are needed by both developmental programs. Other points of vulnerability in the T-cell program must be targeted for silencing by EBF1 and Pax5, during the transition to Ly-6d + \"BLP\" and pro-B cell stage, as cells make the decision to exclude the T-cell fate (Fig. 4) .Pax5 has long been of interest for its negative roles. The concept of commitment as an important stage in hematopoietic development was galvanized by the demonstration that Pax5-deficient pro-B cells could proliferate in vitro for months or years, yet never fully commit to the B cell fate (256, 257) . The cells maintain a clearly B-lineage gene expression profile and even undergo significant Ig gene rearrangement as long as IL-7 is supplied. However, upon IL-7 removal, the cells reveal that they still have access to a variety of myeloid and dendritic cell fates (macrophages, granulocytes, dendritic cells, osteoclasts), and if exposed to Notch ligands, they efficiently switch to the T-cell fate. Thus, although it is turned on too late to explain the initial decrease in myeloid potential from LMPP to CLP, Pax5 is involved in the gene network that confirms loss of access to both the T and myeloid developmental pathways.Although Pax5-knockout pro-B cells have a ready, spontaneous ability to develop into myeloid cells when IL-7 is removed, the fate which is most severely limited by Pax5 is the T cell fate. Ectopic Pax5 expression in hematopoietic precursors has a particularly strong repressive influence on the ability of multipotent precursors to give rise to T cells, and as Bcell development is amplified it is at the expense of T cell development (258, 259) . This can be explained by the finding that Pax5 acts as a potent repressor of Notch1 expression itself.In this respect, from the moment a B-cell precursor achieves an adequate level of Pax5, it should become the equivalent of a Notch1-deficient precursor, selectively blocked in T-cell potential. However, biasing against T-cell potential in Ly6d+ BLPs begins even before the cells fully express Pax5 (102, 103) . Furthermore, even Pax5-deficient B-cell precursors can be completely blocked from T-cell development, provided that their EBF1 is sufficiently activated (159) . If Ebf1 is deleted, pro-B cells with the Pax5 gene intact regain the ability to enter the T-cell pathway (260, 261) . Thus EBF1 as well as Pax5 plays a role in blocking access to the T-cell program.Recent evidence shows that EBF1 can downregulate both Gata3 and Tcf7 (260, 261) . It binds directly to sites in the Tcf7 gene and at least two sites bracketing the transcriptional start site of Gata3, one or both of which are important for repression function. When EBF1 binding is blocked at these sites, Gata3 expression surges again (260) . Notably, EBF1 appears to be repressing here by acting as an \"anti-insulator\". The position of the upstream EBF1 site lies at the boundary between the open chromatin of the Gata3 gene and a large block of repressed chromatin (strongly marked with H3K27me3 modification), which constitutively covers the Gata3 \"1a\" promoter in precursors (65) . In T-lineage cells, the main Gata3 \"1b\" promoter is clear to drive expression. EBF1 binding, however, allows the Gata3 1b promoter and first intron to become buried in repressive marks as well (260), i.e., presumably by allowing the repressive chromatin to spread. Gata3 and Tcf7 repression condemns to death any cell that may be embarking on the T cell program in response to Notch signals. Thus, EBF1 and Pax5 complementarily block access to the T cell fate, first by preventing Notch signaling from turning on the T-cell regulatory program even in precursors that still express substantial Notch1, and then by removing Notch1 itself (Fig. 4) .", "citance": "When EBF1 binding is blocked at these sites, Gata3 expression surges again (260) .", "claims": [{"text": "Gata3 expression decreases when EBF1 binding is blocked at  sites bracketing the transcriptional start site of Gata3.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Gata3 expression decreases when EBF1 binding is blocked at  specific sites within the Tcf7 gene.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Gata3 expression increases when EBF1 binding is blocked at  sites bracketing the transcriptional start site of Gata3.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Gata3 expression increases when EBF1 binding is blocked at  specific sites within the Tcf7 gene.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Recent studies in this field have led to the exciting development of PARP inhibitors as novel cancer therapeutics and have clarified important mechanisms underlying genome instability and tumor suppression in HR-defective disorders. In this review, we provide an overview of the basic molecular mechanisms governing HR and DNA crosslink repair, highlighting BRCA2, and the intriguing relationship between HBOC and FA.", "citation_paragraph": "Defective HR is an important target for chemotherapy in HBOC patients (Konstantinopoulos et al. 2015) . Platinumbased chemotherapy is a well-established and widely used modality for cancer treatment. As cisplatin and its derivative carboplatin induce intrastrand and interstrand crosslinks (Deans & West 2011) , BRCA-deficient, hence ICL repair-deficient, HBOC cells are naturally sensitive to these drugs (De Picciotto et al. 2016) . Indeed, BRCAmutated HBOC patients appear to have a better shortterm prognosis compared with non-BRCA patients, perhaps owing to the better response to chemotherapy (Konstantinopoulos et al. 2015) , though this may not be the case for long-term survival (McLaughlin et al. 2013) . Based on the discovery that PARP inhibition induces a dramatic cell killing in cells deficient in HR (Bryant et al. 2005 , Farmer et al. 2005 , an exciting opportunity to develop novel chemotherapeutic drugs has emerged. This is an instance where two distinct but important DNA repair activities are simultaneously inhibited, leading to cell death (synthetic lethality). An initial explanation that this lethality was due to impaired base excision repair, with an increased level of single-strand breaks that are converted to toxic DSBs by replication, is now challenged, and revised models have been proposed (Helleday 2011 , Konstantinopoulos et al. 2015 .Resistance to chemotherapy drugs invariably appears after the initial clinical response during prolonged treatment. A number of resistance mechanisms have been proposed. It has been suggested that secondary mutations in BRCA genes that restore the wild-type reading frame, leading to recovered HR activity, are the major mechanisms for the acquired resistance (Edwards et al. 2008 , Sakai et al. 2008 . This is analogous to the reversion mosaicism in hematopoietic cells sometimes observed in FA patients, which may mitigate progression of bone marrow failure (Soulier et al. 2005) . Genome instability due to HR defects and selection may contribute to these phenomena. Another mechanism for acquired resistance in BRCA2-deficient tumors is the increased replication fork stability without restoring HR (Chaudhuri et al. 2016) . This could be due to several mechanisms including PTIP deficiency that inhibits the access of MRE11 nuclease to stalled replication forks (Chaudhuri et al. 2016) or loss of the nucleosome remodeling factor CHD4 (Guillemette et al. 2015) . In BRCA1-mutated tumors, normal levels of HR activities might be restored by the loss of 53BP1 or REV7/MAD2L2 (Bouwman et al. 2010 , Boersma et al. 2015 , Xu et al. 2015 . In the absence of BRCA1, these genes function to prevent end resection of DSBs, blocking the subsequent HR reaction.BRCA-deficient tumors may accumulate an enormous number of mutations due to HR defects and genome instability during the carcinogenic process. Thus, these cells may carry higher numbers of tumor-specific peptide antigens that are presented to tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. This hypothesis has been tested in clinical samples, leading to the conclusion that BRCA1/2-mutated high-grade serous ovarian cancer may be more sensitive to recently developed immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies (Strickland et al. 2016) .How defects in HR and ICL repair affect hematopoietic stem cells or promote cancer development?Deficiencies in DNA repair limit the renewal capacity of aging hematopoietic stem cells (Rossi et al. 2007) , and FA patients have higher levels of DNA damage in these cells, leading to the upregulation of p53 and cell death/senescence (Ceccaldi et al. 2012) . The origin of the endogenous damage in FA is an important issue that needs to be resolved ) because this knowledge may allow us to develop a novel strategy for preventing bone marrow failure and cancer. Likewise, it is important to know by what mechanism the genome is destabilized in BRCA mutation carriers.Endogenous aldehydes and lipid peroxidation products have been proposed as major sources of spontaneous DNA damage in FA (Garaycoechea et al. 2012) . Using a mutant cell panel derived from the chicken DT40 cell line, it was shown that cells lacking Fancd2 or Brca2 are particularly sensitive to formaldehyde at concentrations similar to those in normal human serum (Ridpath et al. 2007 ). Patel and coworkers indicated in a series of papers that aldehyde detoxifying enzymes ALDH2 (which mainly catalyzes acetaldehyde) and ADH5 (which mainly catalyzes formaldehyde) play critical roles in FA model mice in the suppression of bone marrow failure and leukemogenesis (Langevin et al. 2011 , Garaycoechea et al. 2012 , Oberbeck et al. 2014 , Pontel et al. 2015 . These results clearly indicate that endogenous aldehydes can damage DNA in hematopoietic stem cells. As East Asians often carry an enzymatically defective ALDH2 variant allele (ALDH2*2), we examined ALDH2 genotypes in our cohort of Japanese FA patients (Hira et al. 2013) . In line with the mouse studies, our results indicated that the ALDH2 variant allele accelerates the progression of bone marrow failure in these patients. Strikingly, we identified several FA children who had homozygous ALDH2 mutations. These patients displayed particularly grave symptoms, including an extremely early onset of myelodysplasia (Hira et al. 2013 , Yabe et al. 2016 ). This combined FA-ALDH2 deficiency could be considered to be a distinct disease entity. It will be exciting to see whether ALDH2 can be a drug target to prevent bone marrow failure in FA patients. A compound that stimulates ALDH2 activity has already been developed (Perez-Miller et al. 2010 ). It will also be interesting to test how ALDH2 status can affect cancer development in HBOC among East Asian populations.Another source of DNA damage can be DNA replication fork stalling, which likely contributes to genome instability in FA or HBOC. The nascent DNA strand at the blocked fork is protected by RAD51 filaments stabilized by the C-terminal domain of BRCA2 in a manner independent of HR (Schlacher et al. 2011) . In the absence of BRCA2, BRCA1 or FANCD2, the stalled fork cannot be protected and is degraded by MRE11 nuclease, leading to the loss of genetic information or genome rearrangements (Schlacher et al. 2012) . This mechanism might be important for genome stability and tumor suppression provided by BRCA1/2 or FA genes.Genes involved in pre-mRNA splicing and in the biogenesis and export of messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) also have an important role for genome stability (Paulsen et al. 2009 ). R-loops consisting of DNA-RNA hybrids and a displaced single-stranded DNA often arise when transcription is perturbed (e.g., upon collision of transcription bubbles and replication forks). Thus, R-loops may be a chief source of replication stress and cancer-associated genome instability. Bhatia and coworkers demonstrated the accumulation of R-loops in BRCA2-depleted cells (Bhatia et al. 2015) . Furthermore, recent studies asked whether the FA pathway coordinates transcription-replication conflicts and is involved in R-loop resolution , Schwab et al. 2015 . Indeed, human and mouse cells deficient in FA gene function accumulate R-loops, indicating that the FA pathway does play a critical role in R-loop resolution. MMC-induced FANCD2 foci levels are reduced by the expression of RNaseH1, which digests RNA in RNA-DNA hybrids. These studies imply that the accumulation of R-loops might contribute to hematopoietic stem cell exhaustion in FA. It will also be interesting to know how R-loops trigger the activation of the FA pathway.Of note, it has also been proposed that cytokines that are upregulated in FA, such as TNF-\u03b1 or TGF-\u03b2, may directly harm hematopoietic stem cells or modulate DNA damage repair in the stem cell compartment (Du et al. 2014 , Zhang et al. 2016 . This line of investigation may inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies for FA.", "citance": "Genes involved in pre-mRNA splicing and in the biogenesis and export of messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) also have an important role for genome stability (Paulsen et al. 2009 ).", "claims": [{"text": "Genes involved in pre-mRNA splicing have a significant impact on genome stability.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Genes involved in the biogenesis and export of messenger ribonucleoprotein have a significant impact on genome stability.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

We analysed 53 patients (24 females and 29 males) with PEAF diagnosed according to the following criteria: partial epilepsy with auditory symptoms, negative family history for epilepsy and absence of cerebral lesions on NMR study. All patients underwent a full clinical, neuroradiological and neurophysiological examination. Forty patients were screened for mutations in LGI1/epitempin, which is involved in ADPEAF. Age at onset ranged from 6 to 39 years (average 19 years). Secondarily generalized seizures were the most common type of seizures at onset (79%). Auditory auras occurred either in isolation (53%) or associated with visual, psychic or aphasic symptoms. Low seizure frequency at onset and good drug responsiveness were common, with 51% of patients seizure-free. Seizures tended to recur after drug withdrawal. Clinically, no major differences were found between S and F patients with respect to age at onset, seizure frequency and response to therapy. Analysis of LGI1/epitempin exons failed to disclose mutations. Our data support the existence of a peculiar form of non-lesional temporal lobe epilepsy closely related to ADPEAF but without a positive family history. This syndrome, here named IPEAF, has a benign course in the majority of patients and could be diagnosed by the presence of auditory aura. Although LGI1 mutations have been excluded, genetic factors may play an aetiopathogenetic role in at least some of these S cases.", "citation_paragraph": "Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of partial epilepsy and is frequently associated with mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS). Intensive research on refractory cases, stimulated by interest in surgical treatment, has documented common aetiologies and clinical characteristics of lesional cases of TLE. Otherwise, little is known about the aetiologies and outcome of non-lesional cases. From epidemiological reviews, it appears that non-lesional TLE is not a uniform disorder, but includes patients with severe refractory epilepsy and cases with a mild epileptic disorder who enter remission with or without antiepileptic medication (Hauser, 1992; Aguglia et al., 1998) .In recent years, growing evidence has indicated that a genetic predisposition appears to be an important causal factor of TLE and familial clustering of the disorder has been reported (Ottman et al., 1995; Scheffer et al., 1995; Berkovic et al., 1996; Cendes et al., 1998) . According to seizure semiology, familial TLE can be divided into two main categories, one with mesial temporal lobe symptoms (Berkovic et al., 1996) and one with lateral symptoms (Ottman et al., 1995) . Whereas familial mesial TLE is a heterogeneous condition (Berkovic et al., 1996; Cendes et al., 1998) , familial lateral TLE appears to be more homogeneous, characterized by simple partial seizures with mainly auditory hallucinations .In 1995, Ottman described the \u00aerst pedigree in which most of the affected members reported seizures with acoustic symptoms usually followed by secondary generalization and named the syndrome autosomal dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features [ADPEAF (OMIM 600512)]. To date, another 20 families have been reported (Poza et al., 1999; Ikeda et al., 2000; Mautner et al., 2000; Michelucci et al., 2000 Michelucci et al., , 2003 Brodtkorb et al., 2002; Santos et al., 2002; Wallace et al., 2002; Winawer et al., 2002; Fertig et al., 2003; Pizzuti et al., 2003) with similar phenotype, clarifying the main features of the syndrome that are characterized by autosomal dominant transmission with high penetrance, onset in the second and third decades of life, recurrent auditory aura usually followed by generalized seizures, low seizure frequency and benign outcome with good drug response. Recently, mutations causing ADPEAF have been found in the leucine-rich, glioma-inactivated 1 gene, LGI1, (Kalachikov et al., 2002; Morante-Redolat et al., 2002) . The gene is located on chromosome 10q24 and was renamed`epitempin' (Morante-Redolat et al., 2002) . The function of this gene is unknown, but a role in neuronal migration has been postulated (Cowell et al., 2002; Gu et al., 2002) . The exclusion of linkage to 10q24 in one ADPEAF family and the absence of LGI1 mutations in a few other families suggest that this syndrome may be genetically heterogeneous (Bisulli et al., 2002; Michelucci et al., 2003) . Evidence that patients with familial aphasic seizures have mutations in the same gene, \u00aerst shown in a Norwegian family , further widens the clinical spectrum of this condition. Thus, the term autosomal dominant lateral temporal epilepsy (ADLTE) rather than ADPEAF has been proposed (Poza et al., 1999; Michelucci et al., 2003) , focusing on seizure onset from the lateral portion of the temporal lobe and therefore including other symptoms (visual and aphasic) which recurred in these families in isolation or associated with auditory auras.Although interest in auditory auras has recently been aroused by the discovery of these ADPEAF cases, auditory symptoms are well known in partial epilepsy of any aetiology and have always been considered a characteristic of temporal lobe seizures (Wunderlich et al., 2000) . Auditory seizures were \u00aerst reported by Holmes as early as 1927 (Holmes, 1927) . Lennox reported a 2.4% incidence of auditory aura among 1359 epileptic patients (Lennox, 1960) . This percentage rose to 16% in Currie's series of 666 patients with temporal lobe seizures (Currie et al., 1971) . Moreover, Pen\u00aeeld and Kristiansen found only three patients out of 222 surgical cases, suggesting the rarity of this condition in refractory epilepsies (Pen\u00aeeld and Kristiansen, 1951) . Therefore, auditory aura is a rare epileptic symptom if we consider only lesional TLE but perhaps more frequent in cryptogenetic cases even if the exact incidence is not reported.The purpose of our study was to describe the clinical characteristics of sporadic (S) cases with partial epilepsy with auditory features (PEAF) and pinpoint clinical, prognostic and genetic differences with respect to previously reported familial (F) cases with autosomal dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features (ADPEAF).", "citance": "From epidemiological reviews, it appears that non-lesional TLE is not a uniform disorder, but includes patients with severe refractory epilepsy and cases with a mild epileptic disorder who enter remission with or without antiepileptic medication (Hauser, 1992; Aguglia et al., 1998) .In recent years, growing evidence has indicated that a genetic predisposition appears to be an important causal factor of TLE and familial clustering of the disorder has been reported (Ottman et al., 1995; Scheffer et al., 1995; Berkovic et al., 1996; Cendes et al., 1998) .", "claims": [{"text": "Genetic predisposition is a causal factor for temporal lobe epilepsy.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Genetic predisposition is not associated with temporal lobe epilepsy.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}

Previously, we demonstrated that several genes specifically cluster with the astrocyte-specific gene for glial fibrillary acidic protein (Gfap) during astrocyte differentiation; however, the molecular mechanisms for gene clustering remain largely unknown. Here we show that brahma-related gene 1 (BRG1), an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factor, and the transcription factor STAT3 are required for Gfap and oncostatin M receptor (Osmr) clustering and enhanced expression through recruitment to STAT3 recognition sequences and that gene clustering occurs prior to transcriptional up-regulation. BRG1 knockdown and JAK-STAT signaling inhibition impaired clustering, leading to transcriptional down-regulation of both genes. BRG1 and STAT3 were recruited to the same Gfap fragment; JAK-STAT signaling inhibition impaired BRG1 recruitment. Our results suggest that BRG1 and STAT3 coordinately regulate gene clustering and up-regulate Gfap and Osmr transcription.", "citation_paragraph": "In this report, we have demonstrated the significance and molecular mechanisms of Gfap and Osmr gene clustering during astrocyte (Gadient and Patterson, 1999; Turnley and Bartlett, 2000) . In mice, the OSM signals through the formation of a heterodimeric complex composed of gp130 and OSMR (Ichihara et al., 1997; Morikawa, 2005) . OSM and its receptor components (OSMR and gp130) are expressed in NPCs, and OSM is significant for astrocyte differentiation in the developing brain through the activation of STAT3 (Yanagisawa et al., 1999 ). In the current study, we found that the expression level of OSMR was increased in undifferentiated NPCs by LIF stimulation (Figure 2A ) as well as in primary astrocytes, although its expression was not affected in microglia by stimulation with either OSM, HIL-6, or LIF (Hsu et al., 2015) . These observations indicate that astrocytes represent a major target for OSM actions in the CNS, in accordance with the observation that OSM inhibits the via the same mechanisms. Consistent with this supposition, we have already shown that at least the two identified genes were not clustered with Gfap simultaneously (Ito et al., 2016) , suggesting that the mechanism of clustering proposed in the current study may not function in a deterministic manner. This interpretation is in line with the finding based on high-throughput imaging position mapping (HIPMap) that factors involved in genome organization affect only a subset of target loci, indicating that their effects are not global (Shachar et al., 2015) . Therefore, it will likely be necessary to establish the detailed clustering mechanisms of each identified gene to determine factors important for astrogenesis. The IL-6/gp130 family of cytokines (e.g., IL-6, IL-11, LIF, and OSM) play important roles in the development and repair of the Development Database at Kumamoto University; Yoshida et al., 1996) at E14.5, and cultured as previously described (Takizawa et al., 2001) . Briefly, timed pregnant ICR mice were killed using cervical dislocation; the brains were carefully dissected out and the telencephala were obtained. The telencephala were then triturated in Hanks' balanced salt solution by gently pipetting with 1-ml pipette tips. Dissociated cells were cultured in N2-supplemented DMEM with F12 containing 10 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; R&D Systems) on culture dishes (Corning) that were precoated with poly-l-ornithine and fibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich). For astrocyte differentiation, the cells were replated on fibronectin/poly-l-lysinecoated glass coverslips (MATSUNAMI) or culture dishes that were precoated with poly-l-ornithine and fibronectin after 4 d of culture and were stimulated for 4 d in the presence of LIF (50 ng/ml; Millipore). All animal procedures were conducted with the approval of proliferation of adult NPCs and induces IL-6 expression in astrocytes (Van Wagoner et al., 2000; Beatus et al., 2011) . Thus, the gene clustering between Gfap and Osmr and the resulting transcriptional enhancement of these genes after LIF stimulation as shown in the present study likely play a central role in the differentiation program of astrocytes. Our current results provide a novel piece of evidence for the mechanisms underlying neural cell differentiation and interchromosomal gene clustering and further insights into brain development.", "citance": "This interpretation is in line with the finding based on high-throughput imaging position mapping (HIPMap) that factors involved in genome organization affect only a subset of target loci, indicating that their effects are not global (Shachar et al., 2015) .", "claims": [{"text": "Genome organization factors effects are not global.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Literature published in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Direct electronic databases was searched and reviewed. Liquid biopsy specially referred to the detection of nucleic acids (circulating cell-free DNA, cfDNA) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the blood of cancer patients. Compared to conventional single-site sampling or biopsy method, liquid biopsy had the advantages such as non-invasiveness, dynamic monitoring, and the most important of all, overcoming the limit of spatial and temporal heterogeneity. The genomic information of cancer could be profiled by genotyping cfDNA/CTC and subsequently applied to make molecular classification, targeted therapy guidance, and unveil drug resistance mechanisms. The serial sampling feature of liquid biopsy made it possible to monitor treatment response in a real-time manner and predict tumor metastasis/recurrence in advance. Liquid biopsy is a non-invasive, dynamic, and informative sampling method with important clinical translational significance in cancer research and practice. Much work needs to be done before it is used in the management of HCC.", "citation_paragraph": "Liquid biopsy is a modality that samples bodily fluids instead of solid tissue for pathophysiological or sequencing analysis; it has been introduced in the fields of prenatal testing, transplantation rejection, diabetes mellitus, and cancer research. Generally, any bodily fluids, including blood, urine, sputum, pleural effusion, ascites, and cerebrospinal fluid, can be used as potential samples for liquid biopsy. A blood sample is most frequently used because of several advantages, including availability, its representation of whole-body condition, noninvasiveness, and the opportunity to repeatedly sample it for dynamic evaluation of health/disease status. Once blood is drawn, cells, proteins, molecules, nucleic acids, and vesicles can be isolated and utilized by different analytical approaches to gather as much information as possible to make an early diagnosis, evaluate treatment response, and/or monitor disease progression. Currently, tumor-derived cells and DNA in the blood, namely circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), are the markers most widely sought in liquid biopsy for cancer research.Surgery, being the most probable therapy to achieve curative effect, has reached its peak in improving the survival of patients with resectable tumors and postoperative recurrence and/or metastases aggravate such conditions. For patients with unresectable solid tumors and hematological malignancies, chemo-radiotherapy and targeted agents are commonly prescribed. Since the identification of mutations responsible for tumor initiation, genotype-based treatments, such as EGFR and BRAF kinase inhibitors, have become the focus of targeted therapeutic strategies. Thus, uncovering the genetic background of disease to tailor personalized drugs and treatments in real-time can improve the clinical outcomes of cancer patients.Traditionally, genomic information is obtained by sequencing tumor tissue that has been either surgically resected or biopsied. However, this method has some intrinsic limits. First, for patients with unresectable metastatic diseases, tumor tissue is unavailable; though biopsy might be conducted in some of these patients, it is not without complications and has weaknesses. The biopsy procedure is painful and bears the risk of bleeding and iatrogenic tumor inoculation; furthermore, in cases where tumors are located deep inside the body and/or close to important blood vessels, biopsy is anatomically challenging and highly risky. Should a biopsy fail, repeated sampling aggravates these situations. Most importantly, tumor sampling and biopsy are both confined to regional sites within a tumor and are thus easily subject to selection bias resulting from tumor heterogeneity.Morphological tumor heterogeneity has long been recognized, but only recently have researchers begun to realize the importance of genetic heterogeneity, which in turn consists of spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Spatial heterogeneity (intratumor heterogeneity, ITH) is caused by subclonal cellular populations harboring heterogeneous genetic, epigenetic, and phenotypic features among different regions of a tumor or between the primary and metastatic sites. ITH has been reported in a variety of cancers, including renal cancer [3, 4] , breast cancer [5] , lung cancer [6, 7] , glioma [8] , ovarian cancer [9] , HCC [10] , and hematological malignancies [11] [12] [13] . The common observation that only some oncogenetic mutations are shared by all cellular populations within a tumor [14] has led the medical community to question the use of biopsy, which can be likened to a snapshot of the whole tumor or a pathological slide that is only a cross-sectional image. Additionally, the differences in genetic backgrounds between primary and metastatic lesions make it less effective to use mutational profiles of primary tumors to guide targeted therapy for metastasis.Temporal heterogeneity confers even greater difficulties for solid tumor biopsy because the changes in a tumor's genome over time cannot be detected by a single test. The development of cancer can be compared to the evolution of species: somatic mutations that occur as early events during tumorigenesis tend to propagate in many or all clones, whereas later mutations exist only in some clones, thus forming heterogeneous populations within tumor lesions. As time goes on, the initiation of treatment (selective pressure), ITH in the tumor microenvironment, the emergence of drug-resistant subclones, selection of rare mutants by treatment, and the seeding of metastatic cells from subclones collectively contribute to the hierarchical tumor model [15] , which is characterized by different genetic backgrounds at different times. Thus, a tumor genome in the later course of the disease might differ significantly from its initial status, and this difference cannot be recognized unless serial sampling is performed. However, repeated biopsy is rarely feasible, and without knowledge of genetic changes, the complete personalization of treatment and targeted therapy is impossible.Liquid biopsy, conversely, is a non-invasive, dynamic means of capturing spatial and temporal tumor heterogeneity in a wide range of cancer types. For metastatic cancers, increasing evidence demonstrates that distant metastases harbor genomic aberrations different from those of the primary tumor, and that such aberrations might provide specific information for systemic or targeted therapy [16] . Moreover, recent work has demonstrated that different metastatic sites harbor different genomic aberrations, and biopsy of one or two accessible metastases may not be representative of every mutant profile [17] . Thus, liquid biopsy surveillance for ctDNA has been proposed as an alternative to metastasis biopsy for noninvasive genotyping across all tumor types [18] and dynamic sequencing of ctDNA suggests that it could be a novel, noninvasive cancer biomarker [19] . Indeed, sequencing liquid biopsies of plasma provides information comparable with that of metastatic biopsies [20] , and, in non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients, rare EGFR mutants absent in tumor samples can be detected in plasma [21] . The applications of liquid biopsy in clinical research and practice will be discussed thoroughly in a later part of this chapter.", "citance": "For metastatic cancers, increasing evidence demonstrates that distant metastases harbor genomic aberrations different from those of the primary tumor, and that such aberrations might provide specific information for systemic or targeted therapy [16] .", "claims": [{"text": "Genomic aberrations of metastases provide information for targeted therapy.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Metastases have genomic aberrations different than those of the primary tumor.

Ensuring continuum of care (at least four antenatal visits; skilled birth attendance; postnatal care within 48 hours, at two weeks, and six weeks) for mother and newborn is crucial in helping Ghana achieve these goals and beyond. This study examined the levels and factors associated with continuum of care (CoC) completion among Ghanaian women aged 15-49.   METHODS A retrospective cross-sectional survey was conducted among women who experienced live births between January 2011 and April 2013 in three regions of Ghana. In a two-stage random sampling method, 1,500 women with infants were selected and interviewed about maternal and newborn service usage in line with CoC. Multiple logistic regression models were used to assess factors associated with CoC completion.   RESULTS Only 8.0% had CoC completion; the greatest gap and contributor to the low CoC was detected between delivery and postnatal care within 48 hours postpartum. About 95% of women had a minimum of four antenatal visits and postnatal care at six weeks postpartum. A total of 75% had skilled assisted delivery and 25% received postnatal care within 48 hours. Factors associated with CoC completion at 95% CI were geographical location (OR = 0.35, CI 0.13-0.39), marital status (OR = 0.45; CI 0.22-0.95), education (OR = 2.71; CI 1.11-6.57), transportation (OR = 1.97; CI 1.07-3.62), and beliefs about childhood illnesses (OR = 0.34; CI0.21-0.61).   CONCLUSION The continuum of care completion rate is low in the study site. Efforts should focus on increasing postnatal care within 48 hours and overcoming the known obstacles to increasing the continuum of care completion rate.", "citation_paragraph": "Ghana is one of the SSA countries that demonstrated progress in key maternal and neonatal health indicators although it faces challenges to meet the MDG 4 and 5 targets [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Although Ghana's under-five mortality ratio fell by 40% from 128 per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 78 per 1,000 live births in 2013, it is still globally ranked among the highest [21] . Worldwide, about 40% of under-five deaths occur within the first 28 days of live [3] . Ghana's neonatal mortality was 29 per 1,000 live births in 2013 and accounted for 37% of all under-five deaths [21, 22] , maternal mortality ratio was 380 per 100,000 live births in 2013, a 50% reduction from 1990 [23] .Community-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) initiative was regarded as a key to improving the coverage of MNCH services in Ghana [24, 25] , and CoC measurement would help to identify whether the improvement is continuous. CHPS was adopted in 1999, as a national health policy initiative to reduce the geographical barriers to healthcare. Initially focusing on deprived and remote areas of rural districts, CHPS endeavors to transform the primary health care system by migrating from the conventional facility-based and 'outreach' services to a program of mobile community-based care provided by a resident nurse [26] . CHPS scale up was motivated by the Navrongo model (an experimental study) that aimed to improve the access, efficiency, and quality of health and family planning care [26] . The principal human resources for CHPS are nurses, referred to as community health officers (CHOs). Some of them are midwives or have midwifery skills to attend emergency deliveries and make referrals should complications arise. The CHOs spend 18 months in training schools and 6 months internship for developing community liaison skills. They are provided with essential equipment and assigned to health posts, termed CHPS compounds where they live and conduct doorstep services [27, 28] . CHOs are supported by community volunteers who help with community mobilization and other basic activities [28] Despite such efforts at the community level, the coverage of delivery assisted by skilled birth attendant (SBA) and early postnatal care (PNC) is relatively low, compared with ANC. According to the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2011, the coverage of delivery assisted by SBA and PNC (up to 48 hours) visit were 68.4% and 41.5%, respectively, whilst the coverage of ANC for four times or above reached 86.6% [29] . That implies that CoC at the time dimension, even if its definition was limited to the continuity from pregnancy to postpartum, was not ensured. Although various components (ANC, SBA, and PNC) of MNCH have been studied [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] , none has assessed MNCH services as a continuum in Ghana.

Moreover, the development and progression of cancer often involves the combined actions of several lncRNAs. Here we propose a multi-step method for constructing lncRNA-lncRNA functional synergistic networks (LFSNs) through co-regulation of functional modules having three features: common coexpressed genes of lncRNA pairs, enrichment in the same functional category and close proximity within protein interaction networks. Applied to three cancers, we constructed cancer-specific LFSNs and found that they exhibit a scale free and modular architecture. In addition, cancer-associated lncRNAs tend to be hubs and are enriched within modules. Although there is little synergistic pairing of lncRNAs across cancers, lncRNA pairs involved in the same cancer hallmarks by regulating same or different biological processes. Finally, we identify prognostic biomarkers within cancer lncRNA expression datasets using modules derived from LFSNs. In summary, this proof-of-principle study indicates synergistic lncRNA pairs can be identified through integrative analysis of genome-wide expression data sets and functional information.", "citation_paragraph": "Although the biology of cancer is extremely complex, that complexity can be reduced and represented by a few cancer hallmarks that enable tumor growth and metastasis [36] . These hallmarks provide a framework for understanding the remarkable diversity of cancers. To further understand the functional roles of synergistic lncRNA pairs in carcinogenesis, for each LFSN, cancer hallmarks associated lncRNA pairs were selected to form cancer hallmark subnetworks. This analysis showed that several cancer hallmarks were deeply involved in the three LFSNs (Supplementary Figure S2) , but with different cancer specificities. In brief, lncRNA pairs in GBM primarily regulate the cancer hallmarks of \"self sufficiency in growth\". Previous studies have demonstrated that GBM is characterized by extensive invasion, rapid growth, necrosis and angiogenesis [37, 38] . The lncRNA pairs in OV mostly regulate the hallmarks \"self sufficiency in growth\" and \"tissue invasion and metastasis\", which is consistent with clinically rapid progress and high metastatic potential of ovary tumors [39, 40] . In addition, \"evading immune detection\" and \"tumor promoting inflammation\" are the two most affected hallmarks in PCa, which indicates that inflammation and immune processes are important for the malignancy of prostate tissue. This is consistent with histological observations, indicating that innate and adaptive immunity actively participates in the pathogenesis, surveillance and progression of prostate cancer [41] [42] [43] .Although no synergistic lncRNA pair was found to share by any two hallmark subnetworks, the hallmark subnetworks are conserved among the three cancers to a certain extent. That is, a large percentage of lncRNA pairs contribute to the same cancer hallmarks by regulating biological processes annotated to those hallmarks. For example, 29, 11 and 689 lncRNA pairs in GBM, OV and PCa, respectively, regulate the biological process of \"DNA repair\", which is related to the \"genome instability and mutation\" hallmark (Supplementary Figure S3) . For GBM and OV, 108 and 97 pairs of lncRNAs regulate \"positive regulation of cell proliferation\" (Supplementary Figure S4) . In PCa, there are no lncRNA pairs regulating this biological process, but three lncRNA pairs control another process, \"positive regulation of signal transduction\" and both processes are annotated to the cancer hallmark \"self sufficiency in growth\". Within these cancer hallmark subnetworks, some experimentally validated disease lncRNAs contribute to carcinogenesis. In GBM, TRAF3IP2-AS1, which is related to brain-associated disease, cooperates with three lncRNAs to regulate \"wound healing\": AC078883.3, RP11-645N11.2 and XLOC_004923. In OV, the obesity-associated lncRNA SNHG11 cooperates with three lncRNAs, RP11-79H23.3, XLOC_002749 and XLOC_0092721, to regulate \"positive regulation of cell proliferation\" which is annotated to the hallmark of \"self sufficiency in growth\".

Centimeter-long DNA molecules change their spatial chromatin organization within micrometer-sized cells during cell cycle progression. In interphase, chromatin is distributed throughout the nucleus to express the genetic information. When cells enter mitosis, chromatin becomes compacted to form mitotic chromosomes. Chromosome condensation, the gross morphological change of spatial chromatin organization in mitosis, is indispensable for the faithful inheritance of genetic information. Structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) complexes are large proteinaceous rings that control spatial chromatin organization at various stages during cell growth and differentiation. By topologically entrapping more than one DNA strand within its ring, SMC complexes are thought to mediate interactions between DNA strands for the establishment of chromatin architecture (Uhlmann 2016) . Two members of the SMC complex family, cohesin and condensin, play distinct yet overlapping roles in shaping mitotic chromosomes: cohesin holds sister chromatids together (Peters and Nishiyama 2012) , while condensin compacts chromatin (Hirano 2016) . A third member of SMC family, the Smc5/6 complex is involved in DNA recombination. Its contribution to chromosome architecture is less well understood (Jeppsson et al. 2014) . Condensin plays a key role in chromosome condensation, since mitotic chromosome-like structures can be reconstituted by condensin in vitro even in the absence of histones, which form the nucleosome units of chromatin Abstract Chromatin is a very long DNA-protein complex that controls the expression and inheritance of the genetic information.

This reveals important molecular insight into chromosome architecture. (Shintomi et al. 2017) . How condensin promotes mitotic chromosome formation is a topic of great current interest. Chromosome conformation capture is a powerful technique to investigate spatial chromatin organization . Using this technique, spatial information of chromatin interactions is obtained from crosslinked chromatin followed by DNA fragmentation and ligation. High throughout sequencing-based chromosome conformation capture, Hi-C, is able to capture spatial proximities of chromatin in a genome-wide manner (Lieberman-Aiden et al. 2009 ). Recent Hi-C studies have revealed that chromatin within the interphase nucleus forms domain structures at different size ranges, such as topologically associating domains (TADs) as well as A and B compartments in higher eukaryotes (Dixon et al. 2012; Lieberman-Aiden et al. 2009 ). These domain structures are controlled by cohesin together with CTCF, the sequence-specific CCCTC-binding factor, to regulate gene expression (Rao et al. 2014; Sofueva et al. 2013) . Similarly, cohesin-mediated smaller chromatin domains, called globules, can be seen in fission yeast interphase nucleus (Mizuguchi et al. 2014) .

The present study used the following techniques: A co-culture system of T24 cells and HUVECs was constructed using a microfluidic chip as a 3D co-culture system; the concentration of lactic acid in the medium of the cells was determined using an automatic microplate reader; a qualitative analysis of mitochondria-associated protein expression was performed by immunofluorescent staining; and a quantitative analysis of mitochondrial-associated protein expression was conducted using western blotting. The present results revealed that between the control groups (monoculture of T24 cells or HUVECs), the mitochondrial-associated protein fluorescence intensity was increased in the HUVECs compared with the T24 cells. The fluorescence intensity of mitochondrial-associated proteins in the HUVEC control group was increased compared with the HUVECs in the experimental co-culture group. In the T24 cells, the protein fluorescence intensity was increased in the experimental co-culture group compared with the control group. In addition, the expression of mitochondria-associated proteins was increased in HUVECs compared with T24 cells in the control groups, while T24 cells in the experimental co-culture group had an increased expression compared with HUVECs in the experimental group (P<0.05). For T24 cells, the expression of mitochondrial-associated proteins was increased in the experimental group compared with the control group, and contrasting results were observed for the HUVECs (P<0.05). Determination of lactic acid concentration demonstrated that lactic acid concentration was highest in the experimental co-culture group, followed by the T24 control group and the HUVEC control group. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that energy metabolism of the bladder tumor cells does not parallel the 'Warburg effect', since even under sufficient oxygen conditions the tumor cells still undergo glycolysis. Additionally, bladder tumor cells have an efficient oxidative phosphorylation process, wherein tumor cells promote glycolysis in adjacent interstitial cells, thereby causing increased formation of nutritional precursors. These high-energy metabolites are transferred to adjacent tumor cells in a specified direction and enter the Krebs Cycle. Ultimately, oxidative phosphorylation increases, and sufficient ATP is produced.", "citation_paragraph": "Tumor cells do not exist as pure homogeneous populations in vivo. Instead, they are embedded in cancer cell nests, which are surrounded by stromal cells and extracellular matrix components, and these are important in the growth, invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. Consequently, endothelial cells and lactic acid affect almost every aspect of cancer progress, including the ability of tumor cells to grow and metastasize (1, 2) . Therefore, it is a disadvantage to only investigate tumor cells in vitro. Glucose is the major energy-yielding nutrient and there are two primary ways for glycometabolism in cells: Glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (3) . The majority of cells rely on oxidative phosphorylation to provide energy during well-oxygenated conditions; however, tumor cells depend on the glycolytic pathway for ATP generation even in an aerobic environment (4) . Previously, in depth research concerning tumor metabolism has revealed that an increasing number of studies consider that the intermediate matrix produced by glycolysis during stromal cell metabolism may be used for synthesizing proteins, nucleic acids and lipids, which provide essential substrates for growth and metastasis of tumor cells (1, 2 (5) . Currently, studies concerning the Reverse Warburg Effect primarily focus on fibroblasts and macrophages; however, there is little study concerning tumor-associated endothelial cells in the tumor environment, which regulate growth, invasion and metastasis of tumor cells by producing various extracellular matrix and cytokines (6) . The effect of tumor-associated endothelial cells on the ability of tumor cells to grow and metastasize is not completely clear. Numerous studies hypothesize that in vivo tumor-associated endothelial cells receive biological signals from tumor cells and other tumor-associated stromal cells by absorbing paracrine factors, and subsequently induce tumor angiogenesis, which is essential for tumor growth and metastasis (7) . In accordance with this hypothesis, the present study established a bionic 3D co-culture system using microfluidic chip technology in order to simulate the tumor microenvironment in vivo. The present study investigated the metabolic characteristics of tumor cells and tumor-endothelial metabolic coupling in the tumor microenvironment by measuring protein expression, which was determined by qualitative and quantitative analysis.", "citance": "Glucose is the major energy-yielding nutrient and there are two primary ways for glycometabolism in cells: Glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (3) .", "claims": [{"text": "Glucose is the major energy yielding nutrient in cells.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Glycolysis is one of the primary glycometabolic pathways in cells.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Oxidative phosphorylation is one of the primary glycometabolic pathways in cells.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

This common form of cerebrovascular disease may manifest clinically as cognitive impairment of varying degrees and difficulty with mobility. Whereas some persons show cognitive decline and mobility failure when there are brain white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and acute stroke, others recover, and not everyone with brain white matter disease is disabled. Thus, repair or compensation of brain white matter may be possible, and furthermore, certain vascular risks, such as raised blood pressure, are targets for prevention of white matter disease or are administered to reduce the burden of such disease. Vascular risk modification may be useful, but alone may not be sufficient to prevent white matter disease progression. In this chapter, we specifically focus on WMH of vascular origin and explore white matter development, plasticity, and enduring processes of myelination across the health span in the context of experimental and human data, and compare and contrast resilient brain white matter propensity to a diseased white matter state. We conclude with thoughts on novel ways one might study white matter resilience, and predict future healthy cognitive and functional outcomes.", "citation_paragraph": "Social isolation: 4 weeks of isolation in juvenile mice Deficits in social interaction task not rescued by social re-introduction mPFC: reduction in ramification of mature astrocytes, reduced internode per oligo, thinning of myelin sheath [89, 90] Complex wheel task in adult miceAdditional OPCs and mature oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum. Generation of new oligodendrocytes required skill improvement [91] Rats trained in single-pallet reaching task Increase FA in Cingulum and external capsule [92] Optical stimulation of the pre-motor cortex in mice In addition to the cross talk between neuronal activity (neurons) and adaptive myelination (oligodendrocytes), cerebral endothelial cells and OPCs are also coupled, wherein endothelial-derived trophic factors regulate OPC behavior [103] . In response to injury, OPC respond with extensive proliferation, migration, and morphological changes in an attempt to regenerate myelin. Endothelial cell-derived trophic factors include FGF-2, BDNF and VEGF A. In turn, OPC-derived TGF-\u03b2 maintains the blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity through development, thus supporting the cerebrovascular system. However, conditions such as hypoxic-ischemic injury can disrupt OPC-endothelium trophic coupling and promote the progression of white matter diseases. Without the trophic support from the endothelial cells, myelin repair fails and injury is extended to involve BBB injury through OPC-derived MMP-9 secretion (for a detailed review, please see [104] ). Remyelination failure results from two different mechanisms. First, OPC regulation is downregulated, resulting in increased OPC proliferation but decreased differentiation [105] . Second, glutamate release resulting neuronal excitotoxicity directly hinders remyelination [106] . Within brain white matter, which is most vulnerable to small vessel injury, myelinated axons, oligodendrocytes, OPC, astrocytes, and microglia that are embedded in the extracellular matrix and nourished by a network of capillaries extending from the perforating or medullary end arteries provide an \"oligovascular\" niche [103, [107] [108] [109] that regulates the health of the white matter. So, considering that tissue regeneration requires not only progenitor cells, but also functional vascular systems, the health of the \"oligovascular\" niche is crucial for maintaining white matter integrity. Identifying mechanisms to maintain the health of the \"oligovascular\" niche and enhance adaptive myelination in response to injury may be the best complement to VRF modification in preserving brain health across the life and health span.It is also well established that normal brain development is contingent upon critical genetic signaling and essential environmental input. In fact, through sequential intrinsic and adaptive pathways, myelination creates a \"smart wiring\" that changes alongside synaptic plasticity, and enables learning as well as preserving brain health [110] . The smart wiring relies on myelination within an initially hard-wired pattern (intrinsic myelination during development) that can undergo adaptation to modify myelin sheath number and/or properties [86] in response to experience (adaptive myelination) and enable CNS plasticity and learning. Hence, the developmental hard wiring is as critical to brain health as the adaptive myelination for cognitive function across the life span (see Table 1 ). So, while in the context of brain aging and vascular injury we have focused on adaptive myelination as substrate for preserving brain health, the influence of intrinsic myelination as a critical contributor to resilience cannot be underestimated.", "citance": "Second, glutamate release resulting neuronal excitotoxicity directly hinders remyelination [106] .", "claims": [{"text": "Glutamate release resulting in neuronal exitotoxicity hinders remyelination.", "subject": "Glutamate release", "is_negation": false}]}

Here, we present a loss-of-function genetic analysis of postnatal BBB and BRB maintenance in mice that shows striking threshold and partial redundancy effects. In particular, the combined loss of Wnt7a and Norrin or Wnt7a and Frizzled4 (Fz4) leads to anatomically localized BBB defects that are far more severe than observed with loss of Wnt7a, Norrin, or Fz4 alone. In the cerebellum, selective loss of Wnt7a in glia combined with ubiquitous loss of Norrin recapitulates the phenotype observed with ubiquitous loss of both Wnt7a and Norrin, implying that glia are the source of Wnt7a in the cerebellum. Tspan12, a coactivator of Norrin signaling in the retina, is also active in BBB maintenance but is less potent than Norrin, consistent with a model in which Tspan12 enhances the amplitude of the Norrin signal in vascular endothelial cells. Finally, in the context of a partially impaired Norrin system, the retina reveals a small contribution to BRB development from the Wnt7a/Wnt7b system. Taken together, these experiments define the extent of CNS region-specific cooperation for several components of the Norrin and Wnt7a/Wnt7b systems, and they reveal substantial regional heterogeneity in the extent to which partially redundant ligands, receptors, and coactivators maintain the BBB and BRB.", "citation_paragraph": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the blood-retina barrier (BRB) play essential roles in maintaining the health of the central nervous system. Two partially redundant ligand-receptor systems-the Norrin and Wnt7a/Wnt7b systems-activate \u03b2-catenin signaling in vascular endothelial cells to control BBB and BRB development and maintenance. The present study explores the partially overlapping roles of these two systems in the postnatal brain and retinal vasculatures. In the cerebellum, the two signaling systems are substantially redundant in maintaining the BBB, with isolated loss of some components, such as the ligand Wnt7a or the coactivator Tspan12, producing little or no barrier defect but combined loss of the two components producing a large defect in barrier integrity.In CNS ECs, signaling via receptor (Frizzled) and coreceptor (Lrp5 or Lrp6) components is greatly enhanced by various integral membrane and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored coactivators (Fig. 1A) . In the context of Norrin signaling, Tspan12, a member of the tetraspanin family of integral membrane proteins, is required for normal retinal angiogenesis (15, 16) . Cell culture experiments also implicate Lgr4, a 7-transmembrane segment (7TM) protein, in Norrin signaling, although its role in vivo is not yet clear (17) . In the context of Wnt7a and Wnt7b signaling, Gpr124, a 7TM protein, and Reck, a GPI-anchored protein, functionally interact with each other and with Wnt7a or Wnt7b, Frizzled, and Lrp5 or Lrp6 at the plasma membrane to enhance \u03b2-catenin signaling, a system that we refer to as \"Wnt7a/Wnt7b signaling\" (14, (18) (19) (20) . Gpr124 and Reck are essential for CNS angiogenesis and BBB development in multiple brain and spinal cord regions (7, 14, (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) . Gpr124 also functions to minimize BBB breakdown in mouse models of ischemic stroke and glioblastoma (27) .The existence of two classes of \u03b2-catenin ligands (Norrin and Wnt7a/Wnt7b) with distinct coactivator proteins dedicated to each (Tspan12 and Gpr124/Reck, respectively) suggests that different CNS regions may rely to different extents on one or the other to control angiogenesis and barrier formation and maintenance. Consistent with this idea, earlier studies found that angiogenesis in the retina is controlled largely or exclusively by the Norrin system (6, 8, 11, 15, 28) and that angiogenesis in the cerebral cortex and medial ganglionic eminences are controlled largely or exclusively by the Wnt7a/Wnt7b system (9, 10, (21) (22) (23) . In contrast, angiogenesis in the hindbrain is impaired only when both systems are mutated (14, 18) .Redundancy between the Norrin and Wnt7a/Wnt7b systems is also observed in the postnatal brain. Whereas constitutive loss of Norrin produces only a mild reduction in barrier integrity in the postnatal cerebellum and olfactory bulb, and reduction in Wnt7a/Wnt7b signaling (due to conditional deletion of Gpr124 or partial inactivation of Reck) has no effect on postnatal CNS barrier integrity, the combined loss of Norrin and either Gpr124 or Reck leads to severe BBB defects in the cortex, thalamus, and brainstem (14, 18) . Fig. 1B summarizes published data related to the effects of mutations in Norrin and Wnt7a/ Wnt7b signaling components on postnatal BBB and BRB maintenance. To date, Tspan12 has been studied in the retina (15) , but its function, if any, in the brain has not been explored.At present, the role of the Wnt7a/Wnt7b system in BBB maintenance has largely been inferred from the phenotypes of Gpr124 and Reck loss-of-function mutations, either alone or in combination with mutations in Ndp or Fz4. However, Gpr124 has been reported to function in diverse processes, some of which may not reflect its role in \u03b2-catenin signaling. These include promoting EC survival via integrin signaling (29) , mediating contact inhibition (30) , enhancing EC responses to VEGF (31) , and increasing cell adhesion (32) . Similarly, the multidomain protein Reck includes a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor domain that is distinct from the N-terminal domains implicated in Wnt7a/Wnt7b signaling and, therefore, some of Reck's lossof-function phenotypes may reflect functions distinct from Wnt7a/Wnt7b signaling (33, 34) . These considerations emphasize the importance of directly testing the effects of mutations in Wnt7a and/or Wnt7b alone and in combination with mutations in other genes coding for \u03b2-catenin signaling components.The present studies were undertaken to more fully define the interactions between the Norrin and Wnt7a/Wnt7b signaling systems in CNS BBB maintenance and to explore the function of Tspan12 in BBB integrity, with the goal of filling the knowledge gaps indicated in Fig. 1B .", "citance": "Gpr124 also functions to minimize BBB breakdown in mouse models of ischemic stroke and glioblastoma (27) .The", "claims": [{"text": "Gpr124 accellerates BBB breakdown in mouse models of glioblastoma.", "subject": "Gpr124", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Gpr124 increases BBB breakdown in mouse models of ischemic stroke.", "subject": "Gpr124", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Gpr124 suppresses BBB breakdown in mouse models of glioblastoma.", "subject": "Gpr124", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Gpr124 suppresses BBB breakdown in mouse models of ischemic stroke.", "subject": "Gpr124", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 52070250, "title": "From Neural Crest Development to Cancer and Vice Versa: How p75NTR and (Pro)neurotrophins Could Act on Cell Migration and Invasion?", "abstract": "The p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), also known as low-affinity nerve growth factor, belongs to the tumor necrosis factor family of receptors. p75NTR is widely expressed in the nervous system during the development, as well as, in the neural crest population, since p75NTR has been described as ubiquitously expressed and considered as a neural crest marker. Neural crest cells (NCCs) constitute an transient population accurately migrating and invading, with precision, defined sites of the embryo. During migration, NCCs are guided along distinct migratory pathways by specialized molecules present in the extracellular matrix or on the surfaces of those cells. Two main processes direct NCC migration during the development: (1) an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and (2) a process known as contact inhibition of locomotion. In adults, p75NTR remains expressed by NCCs and has been identified in an increasing number of cancer cells. Nonetheless, the regulation of the expression of p75NTR and the underlying mechanisms in stem cell biology or cancer cells have not yet been sufficiently addressed. The main objective of this review is therefore to analyze elements of our actual knowledge regarding p75NTR roles during the development (mainly focusing on neural crest development) and see how we can transpose that information from development to cancer (and vice versa) to better understand the link between p75NTR and cell migration and invasion. In this review, we successively analyzed the molecular mechanisms of p75NTR when it interacts with several coreceptors and/or effectors. We then analyzed which signaling pathways are the most activated or linked to NCC migration during the development. Regarding cancer, we analyzed the described molecular pathways underlying cancer cell migration when p75NTR was correlated to cancer cell migration and invasion. From those diverse sources of information, we finally summarized potential molecular mechanisms underlying p75NTR activation in cell migration and invasion that could lead to new research areas to develop new therapeutic protocols.", "citation_paragraph": "p75 NTR is a single membrane-spanning protein in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family (Heuer et al., 1990) . p75 NTR is a 427-amino-acid transmembrane receptor containing an extracellular domain (ECD) with a cleavable 28 amino acid (aa) signal peptide, followed by four 40 aa extracellular cysteine-rich domains, one of which contains a N-glycosylated site ( Figure 1A) . Multiple O-glycosylation sites exist in the juxtamembrane domain. The intracellular domain (ICD) contains an 80 aa death domain (DD), the signature of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family that includes sites for interactions with numerous signaling effectors. The DD is a globular complex protein including six-helix bundle fold. DD-containing proteins play important roles in inflammatory and in apoptotic signaling through the formation of oligomeric protein complexes . p75 NTR contains a DD similar, in some ways, to other TNF-associated DDs. However, a major difference between p75 NTR and other TNF receptors is that the p75 NTR ICD is unable to autoactivate and has to interact with other effector proteins to exert its functions (Meeker and Williams, 2014) . Another remarkable specificity of p75 NTR (compared to other TNF receptors) is the 29 AA juxtamembrane region, which is also known as the Chopper domain, located at the N-terminal part of the DD. In this case, the Chopper domain has the ability to independently interact with apoptotic peptidase-activating factor 1 (APAF-1) to induce cell death (reviewed by Skeldal et al., 2011; Meeker and Williams, 2014) . Altogether and depending on the type of interactions with a specific coreceptor and/or effector, a wide range of signaling events may occur that lead to many different responses (Meeker and Williams, 2014) . The most significant identified p75 NTR signaling pathways include Ras homolog gene family, member A (RhoA), Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and nuclear factor \u03baappa B (NF\u03baB) (Wang et al., 2008) . These pathways are possibly activated through various regions of the ICD upon interactions with other proteins (Wang et al., 2008) . Among those proteins, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (Rho-GDI), ribosome-inactivating protein-2 (RIP-2), and p75 NTR -associated cell death executor (NADE) have been described as interacting with the p75 NTR DD (Wang et al., 2008) . Likewise, Schwann cell factor-1 (SC-1), neurotrophin receptor-interacting MAGE homolog (NRAGE), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptorassociated factor (TRAF), and neurotrophin receptor-interacting factor (NRIF) have been described as inducing those signaling pathways through interactions with the juxtamembrane region of p75 NTR (Wang et al., 2008) . Finally, it was demonstrated that an ankyrin-rich membrane-spanning protein (ARMS) initially identified as Kidins220 is able to interact with the ICD to form a ternary complex with Trk receptors (Chang et al., 2004) .Beside intracellular effectors, neurotrophins (NTs) play pivotal roles in p75 NTR signaling pathways. NTs belong to a large group of growth factors that mainly target neurons of the central and peripheral nervous systems, during the development. NTs are known, among other activities, to stimulate neurite growth, to maintain viability, or to induce cell differentiation. The first NT to be defined was the NGF (Sutter et al., 1979) . Historically, it was also the first growth factor to be purified and characterized in 1960 (Aloe, 2004) . Several years later, a homolog of the NGF was isolated, characterized, and named brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (Barde et al., 1982) . Molecular cloning experiments defined two more mammalian members of this family, NTs 3 and 4/5 (NT3 and NT4/5) (Maisonpierre et al., 1991; Ip et al., 1992) . NTs activate two different classes of receptor: the tropomyosin-related kinase receptors family (Trk A, B, and C) and the low-affinity-NGF receptor named p75 NTR (Huang and Reichardt, 2001) .Neurotrophins are expressed by the cells as a proneurotrophin (proNT) and are matured by proteolysis processes. When proNTs were initially discovered, they were considered as inactive precursors of the mature proteins (reviewed by Meeker and Williams, 2014) . However, multiple studies indicated that the proNTs are also physiologically active (Lee et al., 2001) and that NT signaling pathways work through a balance between mature and immature (pro-) NTs (reviewed by Meeker and Williams, 2014) . Likewise, it has been suggested that the interactions of p75 NTR with its coreceptors regulate the availability of highaffinity targets for mature or immature (pro-) NTs (reviewed by Meeker and Williams, 2014) .Neurotrophins can act directly or indirectly on p75 NTR mainly through its interactions with three major coreceptor families: Trk (A, B, and C), sortilin, and Nogo receptors (Meeker and Williams, 2014 ; Figure 1B ). Trk receptors were first identified as colon-derived oncogene in which tropomyosin was fused to a tyrosine kinase domain. Currently, three Trk receptors have been identified: TrkA (or NTRK1), TrkB (or NTRK2), and TrkC (or NTRK3). Trk receptors are characterized by the presence of an extracellular domain, with three tandem leucine-rich motifs flanked by two cysteine clusters in their amino termini, and two immunoglobulin-like domains in the membrane-bound region (Huang and Reichardt, 2001) . Differential splicings of the TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC mRNAs result in protein expression with various ligand affinities due to changes into their extracellular domain (Huang and Reichardt, 2001) . The presence or absence of short amino-acid sequences, in the juxtamembrane domain of each receptor, affects the ability of some NTs to activate these receptors (Huang and Reichardt, 2001) . Each Trk has therefore a different NT binding specificity: TrkA binds NGF, TrkB binds BDNF and NT4/5, and TrkC binds NT3 (TrkA and TrkB bind NT3 but to a lesser extent). As reviewed by Pramanik et al. (2016) , interactions between Trk receptors and p75 NTR increase the binding affinity for NTs and support pro-survival and pro-growth signaling via various pathways such as MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT, and PLC\u03b3. Regarding migration and invasion (and among other examples), TrkA overexpression has been linked to breast cancer cell migration and invasion through PI3K and ERK/p38 MAP kinase pathways (Lagadec et al., 2009 ). TrkB overexpression has been shown to induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), leading to invasion processes of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (Kupferman et al., 2010) . Likewise, BDNF/TrkB have been linked to neuroblastoma cell migration through PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK pathway activations (Hua et al., 2016) . TrkC has also been linked to cell migration as TrkC upon NT3 activation leads to adenoid cystic carcinoma cell migration through AKT/ERK pathway activations (Ivanov et al., 2013) .Besides Trk receptors, the most studied non-Trk p75 NTR coreceptor is sortilin. Sortilin, also known as neurotensin receptor 3 (NTS3 or NTR3), belongs to the vacuolar protein sorting 10 (Vps10) domain family (Wilson et al., 2014) . Sortilin is a sorting protein mainly found within late endosomes derived from the trans-Golgi network. In this context, sortilin has been described as assisting the anterograde trafficking of NT receptors and to control proBDNF secretion (Reviewed by Meeker and Williams, 2014) . With regards to invasion and migration, it has been demonstrated that proNGF induced migration in thyroid cancer cells, through p75 NTR /TrkA/sortilin leading to SRC signaling pathway activation (Faulkner et al., 2018) . Likewise, in clear cell renal cell carcinoma, it was shown that proBDNF induced cell migration through p75 NTR /TrkB/sortilin leading to the activation of AKT and ERK pathways (De la Cruz-Morcillo et al., 2016) .The Nogo receptors (NgR1, NgR2, and NgR3) are glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored receptors mainly expressed by neurons, in the central and peripheral nervous systems (He et al., 2003) . NgRs are cell-surface receptors presenting a highly conserved eight leucine-rich repeats (LRR) flanked by cysteine-rich LRRNT (leucine-rich repeat N-terminal) and LRRCT (leucine-rich repeat C-terminal) domains, as classically described for the LRR family proteins. As described by Saha and collaborators, the LRR domains are connected to the GPI-anchor for membrane attachment via a \"stalk\" region (Saha et al., 2014) . The LINGO-1 receptor is the functional component of NgR. LINGO-1 contains an LRR domain, an immunoglobulinlike domain, a stalk domain, a transmembrane region, and a FIGURE 1 | Schematic view of p75 NTR receptor and coreceptors (inspired by Skeldal et al., 2011) . (A) p75 NTR present an extracellular N-terminal part including four cysteine-rich domains (CRD) and a single-peptide transmembrane domain, and an intracellular c-terminal part containing a Chopper domain and a death domain. The extracellular part is cleavable by TACE/ADAM17 enzyme while the intracellular part is cleavable by gamma-secretase enzyme. (B) p75 NTR has several coreceptors including sortilin, TrkA, TrkB, TrkC, and Nogo receptors (NgR).short cytoplasmic tail. In the migration context, it seems that Nogo receptors could have inhibitory or inductive effects on cell migration and invasion. Indeed, Jin et al. (2016) demonstrated that Nogo-A was able to inhibit the migration and invasion of human malignant glioma cells via the downregulation of RhoA-cofilin signaling. On the contrary, NgR3 seems to induce nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell migration by activating focal adhesion kinase (FAK) (He et al., 2018) .As the main objective of this review is to understand the role of p75 NTR in cell migration and invasion, we will mainly focus the next parts of this review on p75 NTR cellular and molecular pathways with regard to those processes.", "citance": "Among those proteins, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (Rho-GDI), ribosome-inactivating protein-2 (RIP-2), and p75 NTR -associated cell death executor (NADE) have been described as interacting with the p75 NTR DD (Wang et al., 2008) .", "claims": [{"text": "Guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (Rho-GDI) interacts with the p75 NTR death domain", "subject": "Guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (Rho-GDI) ", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Ribosome-inactivating protein-2 (RIP-2) interacts with the p75 NTR death domain", "subject": "Ribosome-inactivating protein-2 (RIP-2)", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "p75 NTR - associated cell death executor (NADE) interacts with the p75 NTR death domain", "subject": "p75 NTR - associated cell death executor (NADE)", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 2071533, "title": "Localized Tensional Forces on PECAM-1 Elicit a Global Mechanotransduction Response via the Integrin-RhoA Pathway", "abstract": "BACKGROUND Mechanical forces regulate cell behavior and function during development, differentiation, and tissue morphogenesis. In the vascular system, forces produced by blood flow are critical determinants not only of morphogenesis and function, but also of pathological states such as atherosclerosis. Endothelial cells (ECs) have numerous mechanotransducers, including platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) at cell-cell junctions and integrins at cell-matrix adhesions. However, the processes by which forces are transduced to biochemical signals and subsequently translated into downstream effects are poorly understood.   RESULTS Here, we examine mechanochemical signaling in response to direct force application on PECAM-1. We demonstrate that localized tensional forces on PECAM-1 result in, surprisingly, global signaling responses. Specifically, force-dependent activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) downstream of PECAM-1 promotes cell-wide activation of integrins and the small GTPase RhoA. These signaling events facilitate changes in cytoskeletal architecture, including growth of focal adhesions and adaptive cytoskeletal stiffening.   CONCLUSIONS Taken together, our work provides the first evidence of a global signaling event in response to a localized mechanical stress. In addition, these data provide a possible mechanism for the differential stiffness of vessels exposed to distinct hemodynamic force patterns in vivo.", "citation_paragraph": "Growing evidence suggests that the integrin-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesions function as sites of mechanotransduction, where upon application of external forces on integrins, an intracellular response is activated that leads to local focal adhesion assembly and associated cytoskeletal strengthening [2, 4, 11] . We therefore examined whether integrin ligation with the underlying ECM plays a role in force transmission via PECAM-1. We used a blocking (16G3) or nonblocking (11E5) antibody to inhibit new integrin-FN connections without disrupting existing adhesions [12] . Inhibition of force-induced integrin engagement with the FN blocking antibody attenuated PECAM-1-mediated adaptive stiffening, whereas the nonblocking antibody had no effect (Figure 2A ). These data suggest that new integrin-FN connections are required for adaptive stiffening and indicate that the mechanical response requires input from more than one mechanosensor. Next, we tested the possibility that new integrin-FN connections are required for force-induced PI3K activation. To this regard, inhibition of new integrin-FN connections had no effect on force-dependent PI3K activation ( Figure 2B ), because ECs subjected to force showed similar levels of activation in the presence of the blocking and nonblocking antibodies. These data suggest that PI3K activation is upstream of integrin ligation with the underlying ECM.Tensional Forces on PECAM-1 Activate the RhoA Pathway via GEF-H1 and LARG Local activation of the small GTPase RhoA has been implicated in adaptive cellular stiffening in response to mechanical stresses on integrins [3, 11] . To investigate the role of the RhoA pathway in adaptive stiffening downstream of PECAM-1, we pretreated ECs with C3 transferase or Y27632, Rho and ROCK inhibitors, respectively, prior to force application. Inhibition of either Rho or ROCK attenuated adaptation to force ( Figure 3A) , suggesting a role for the RhoA pathway in adaptive stiffening. We therefore hypothesized that tensional forces on PECAM-1 lead to RhoA activation, which is required for cytoskeletal adaptation to force. To test this hypothesis, we performed Rho pull-down assays to detect levels of active RhoA. ECs were incubated with anti-PECAM-1-coated beads and stimulated with continuous force (w10 pN) using a permanent magnet for biochemical analyses. Indeed, ECs subjected to tensional force on PECAM-1 displayed robust and sustained RhoA activation in response to force, as levels of GTP-loaded RhoA increased at 5 min of force application and remained elevated at 30 min of sustained force ( Figure 3B ). Force-induced RhoA activation was specific to PECAM-1, because poly-lysine-coated beads did not increase levels of active RhoA in response to force ( Figure S2 ). Interestingly, PECAM-1-mediated RhoA activation was integrin dependent, because inhibition of new integrin-FN connections quenched force-induced RhoA activity ( Figure 3C ).We next sought to identify the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that mediate force-induced RhoA activation by performing affinity pull-downs with a nucleotide-free RhoA mutant (G17A) [13] . Analysis revealed a force-dependent increase in GEF-H1 and LARG activity, whereas the activity of other GEFs, such as Dbl, Vav, and Net1, were unaffected ( Figure 4A ). Interestingly, these GEFs also mediate RhoA activation in response to tensional forces on FN-binding integrins [11] . It was also reported that mechanical activation of GEF-H1 relies on activation of a FAK/ERK pathway. Previous studies have demonstrated force-dependent activation of ERK downstream of PECAM-1 [14] [15] [16] . In agreement with previous reports, in response to tensional forces on PECAM-1, we observed a force-dependent increase of ERK activation, as well as FAK phosphorylation ( Figure 4B ). Furthermore, inhibition of FAK or ERK activity with pharmacological inhibitors (FAK 14 or U0126, respectively) attenuated force-induced GEF-H1 activation, whereas LARG activity was unaffected ( Figure 4C ). These data suggest a common pathway employed for GEF activation in response to tension on diverse adhesion molecules and, therefore, may represent a conserved mechanosensitive pathway. In order to confirm a role for GEF-H1 and LARG in PECAM-1-mediated RhoA activation, siRNAs were used to knock down these GEFs in ECs. Depletion of GEF-H1 and LARG with specific siRNAs attenuated RhoA activation and adaptive cellular stiffening in response to tensional forces on PECAM-1 ( Figures 4D and  4E ), further supporting a role for these GEFs in PECAM-1-dependent stiffening.", "citance": "Interestingly, these GEFs also mediate RhoA activation in response to tensional forces on FN-binding integrins [11] .", "claims": [{"text": "Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) mediate RhoA activation in response to tensional forces on fibronectin-binding integrins.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Apoptosis of oncogenic protein Mcl1-expressing cells is mainly regulated by Noxa-mediated degradation of Mcl1. We wanted to elucidate the status of Noxa in H. pylori-infected GECs. For this, various GECs such as AGS, MKN45, and KATO III were either infected with H. pylori or left uninfected. The effect of infection was examined by immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, in vitro binding assay, flow cytometry, and confocal microscopy. Infected GECs, surgical samples collected from patients with gastric adenocarcinoma as well as biopsy samples from patients infected with H. pylori showed significant up-regulation of both Mcl1 and Noxa compared with noninfected samples. Coexistence of Mcl1 and Noxa was indicative of an impaired Mcl-Noxa interaction. We proved that Noxa was phosphorylated at Ser(13) residue by JNK in infected GECs, which caused cytoplasmic retention of Noxa. JNK inhibition enhanced Mcl1-Noxa interaction in the mitochondrial fraction of infected cells, whereas overexpression of nonphosphorylatable Noxa resulted in enhanced mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in the infected epithelium. Because phosphorylation-dephosphorylation can regulate the apoptotic function of Noxa, this could be a potential target molecule for future treatment approaches for H. pylori-induced gastric cancer.", "citation_paragraph": "The chronic imbalance between host epithelial cell death and proliferation is a major mechanism that contributes to H. pylori-mediated gastric cancer because it allows accumulation of mutations in host cells (28) . The BH3-only apoptotic protein Noxa binds mainly with the antiapoptotic protein Mcl1, a complex that is targeted for proteasomal degradation. Thus, Noxa functions as a critical regulator of apoptosis in Mcl1-expressing cells (29) . Here, we report that although Noxa is up-regulated in H. pylori-infected GECs, its apoptotic function is regulated by phosphorylation. The stress-induced kinase JNK, which mediates apoptosis in the H. pylori-infected gastric epithelium (30, 31) , is responsible for Noxa phosphorylation. This also indicates that H. pylori can mold host apoptotic effectors toward antiapoptosis.H. pylori infection induces gastric epithelial ROS generation and apoptosis (32) . The indirect activation model of apoptosis suggests that the interaction of BH3-only proteins with their antiapoptotic partners induces conformational changes in the multi-BH domaincontaining proteins Bax and Bak. This leads to autooligomerization of these \"apoptosis effectors\" in the outer membrane of the mitochondria, resulting in the release of cytochrome c (33). BH3-only proteins show selectivity in binding with antiapoptotic members of the Bcl2 family. As a \"sensitizer,\" BH3-only protein Noxa was earlier thought to have a weak proapoptotic function. However, Lowman et al. (11) showed that S13A Noxa-expressing leukemia cells die from glucose stress. These investigators were unable to generate stable S13A-expressing Jurkat cells. We also failed in our attempt to generate GECs with Noxa S13A mutation, which strengthened our belief that Noxa phosphorylation by H. pylori has some essential protective functions against apoptosis. Previously, induction of Noxa was reported to be essential but not sufficient for apoptosis (34) . Thus, we surmise that Noxa phosphorylation could be one of the explanations of these findings. H. pylori induces MAPKs and regulates various cellular processes, including cell cycle, proliferation, and apoptosis (21) . JNK plays a role in regulating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway because activation of JNK increases cytochrome c release (35) . Our results reveal a new phenomenon that Noxa is phosphorylated by JNK in H. pylori-infected GECs and regulates the apoptotic potential of Noxa. Because JNK can induce invasiveness and motility of H. pylori-infected cells (36), we speculate that Noxa phosphorylation by JNK also helps in the survival of invasive gastric cancer cells. Further studies are needed to explore this hypothesis.One of the main steps in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway is Bax translocation to mitochondria. H. pylori enhances Bax translocation to mitochondria followed by mitochondrial fragmentation (27) . Although the Mcl1-Bak interaction is well known, a direct Mcl1-Bax interaction is not commonly observed. However, it has been shown that following Bax translocation to mitochondria, Mcl1 can inhibit Bax-induced cytochrome c release (37) . Although the same group reports that direct interaction with Mcl1 is not required for Bax inhibition in that study, there is evidence that a Mcl1-Bax interaction exists (38) . We report here that H. pylori induces direct interaction of Mcl1 with Bax. Our results also confirm that abrogation of JNK-mediated phosphorylation of Noxa in infected GECs results in direct Mcl1-Noxa interaction in the H. pylori-infected gastric epithelium. We presume that in the presence of nonphosphorylated Noxa (P-Noxa), which has a very high affinity and priority to bind with Mcl1 (39, 40) , Bax is displaced from Mcl1, oligomerizes, and helps in cytochrome c release. p53 is crucial in regulating cell survival, apoptosis, as well as cell cycle and is a very highly mutated gene in human cancers (41) . Although it is one of the main transcription factors that induce Noxa, p53-independent mechanisms of Noxa induction also exist and are targeted to treat cancers (42, 43) . Almost 40% of cases of gastric cancer have p53 mutations, and H. pylori can cause p53 mutations as well (28, 44) . A recent study suggests that p53 can even be inhibited by H. pylori in a mutation-independent mechanism (45) . Tumor suppressor function and transcriptional activity of p53 remain inhibited in B cells of patients with MALT lymphoma (46) . In our study, Hif1a was highly induced and shown to be a major inducer of Noxa in H. pylori-infected GECs. Because Hif1a (47) and H. pylori (48) individually can contribute to gastric cancer chemoresistance, it is likely that P-Noxa induction by H. pylori further increases the risk for treatment resistance in gastric cancer. We believe that the accumulation of P-Noxa resulting in antiapoptosis of the H. pylori-infected GECs would contribute to accumulation of mutations, leading to the increased probability of developing gastric cancer. Because Noxa and P-Noxa both are induced by H. pylori, it is difficult to assess a direct causeeffect relationship as the P-Noxa:Noxa ratio in gastric cancer tissue samples has not been studied yet. Further research is required to identify the prevalence of Noxa Ser 13 mutation and P-JNK expression pattern in H. pylori-infected gastric biopsy samples.Given the frequency of gastric cancer metastasis and treatment resistance, developing new targeted treatment strategies is very important. Because phosphorylationdephosphorylation can regulate apoptotic functions of Noxa, this is a potential target molecule for future treatment approaches in H. pylori-induced gastric cancer. Noxa phosphorylation may also be implicated in carcinogenic events in other types of cancer.", "citance": "The chronic imbalance between host epithelial cell death and proliferation is a major mechanism that contributes to H. pylori-mediated gastric cancer because it allows accumulation of mutations in host cells (28) .", "claims": [{"text": "H.pylori-mediated gastric cancer occurs due to the accumulation of mutations in host epithelial cells.", "subject": "H.pylori-mediated gastric cancer", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 13877980, "title": "Molecular profiling of endometrial carcinoma precursor, primary and metastatic lesions suggests different targets for treatment in obese compared to non-obese patients", "abstract": "Obesity is linked to increased incidence of endometrioid endometrial cancer (EEC) and complex atypical hyperplasia (CAH). We here explore pattern and sequence of molecular alterations characterizing endometrial carcinogenesis in general and related to body mass index (BMI), to improve diagnostic stratification and treatment strategies. We performed molecular characterization of 729 prospectively collected EEC and CAH. Candidate biomarkers were identified in frozen samples by whole-exome and Sanger sequencing, oligonucleotide gene expression and Reverse Phase Protein Arrays (investigation cohort) and further explored in formalin fixed tissues by immunohistochemistry and Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization (validation cohort). We here demonstrate that PIK3CA mutations, PTEN loss, PI3K and KRAS activation are early events in endometrial carcinogenesis. Molecular changes related to KRAS activation and inflammation are more common in obese CAH patients, suggesting different prevention and systemic treatment strategies in obese and non-obese patients. We also found that oncoprotein Stathmin might improve preoperative diagnostic distinction between premalignant and malignant endometrial lesions.", "citation_paragraph": "The search for diagnostic markers and conservative treatment opportunities for patients with premalignant endometrial lesions and low grade malignant endometrial cancer is of importance as the incidence of these lesions are increasing. The need for non-invasive treatment opportunities is especially warranted in younger women wanting to preserve fertility. Currently hysterectomy is the preferred treatment for patients with atypical hyperplasia, due to risk of occult carcinoma, as well as the substantial risk of progression to invasive carcinoma [9, 22, 23] . In our material CAH patients were significantly younger than EEC patients. This appears to be in line with the knowledge of CAH as a condition preceding EEC, also supported by a nested case-control study demonstrating a cancer progression interval to be four to six years after initial diagnosis of complex or atypical hyperplasia [24] .Obesity is an increasing concern in both developed and less developed countries, and the link between high BMI, diet and cancer is a growing field of interest [5, 25] . Endometrial cancer, and especially endometrioid subtype and its precursor lesions, is strongly linked to obesity [5] . Interestingly we find that KRAS mRNA expression is significantly higher in obese patients with CAH, opposed to STMN1 expression, being significantly higher in non-obese CAH patients. Previously, KRAS alteration has been reported to be an early event in the endometrial carcinogenesis [26] , and KRAS mutations have been associated with higher BMI [27] , apparently in line with our finding that KRAS seems to play a different role in obese compared to non-obese patients in the earliest premalignant part of the carcinogenesis. We have demonstrated here a distinct enrichment of KRAS related oncogenic signatures and GO signatures linked to inflammation in obese compared to non-obese CAH patients. Apparently in line with our findings, inflammation in general, and particular obesity induced inflammation processes are believed to be important in cancer initiation, promotion and metastatic progression [28] . Furthermore, obesity related immunological processes have been linked to KRAS induced cancer initiation of pancreatic adenocarcinoma in mice [29, 30] . Intriguingly, metformin, an anti-diabetic drug used to treat metabolic syndrome and obesity related diabetes, has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation in endometrial cancer cells with activated KRAS, further suggesting a link between KRAS status and the potential for targeting metabolic syndrome in obese patients with endometrial carcinoma (precursor) lesions [31] . Also, based on studies of obese rats, metformin has been demonstrated to decrease estrogen-related endometrial proliferation, partly through the MAPK/ERK pathway [32] . In our small set of 10 patients assessed by WES we found no KRAS mutation. Whether the observed KRAS activation in obese patients with CAH lesions could be explained by increased upstream signaling, post-translational modification or loss of DNA methylation needs further studies. We found that STMN1 and PI3K pathway activation increase before invasion in non-obese patients in particular, indicating their key-role in the initiation of carcinogenesis in the non-obese context. This is also in line with the clinical observation that tumors less related to hormonal risk factors more often demonstrate activated PI3K signaling [16] and are more common in non-obese women.We demonstrate here a late loss of hormone receptors, both on mRNA and protein level in the endometrial carcinogenesis. In addition, a significant increase in a predefined EMT gene signature [33] seem to occur during dedifferentiation. This is in line with earlier findings proposing EMT as a late event in endometrial carcinogenesis, also linked to loss of hormone receptors [33] . Hormone receptor expression has, also in line with our results, previously convincingly been linked to the endometrioid subtype and is more common in low grade compared with high grade lesions [34] . Loss of PR protein expression has recently been demonstrated to be an independent negative prognostic marker in patients with endometrioid endometrial cancer. Loss of protein expression increase from premalignant to malignant lesions and further during dedifferentiation [35] . Premalignant endometrial lesions, as well as low grade endometrioid malignant lesions often demonstrate preserved hormone receptor expression. Also, high expression of PR is proposed as a marker for progestin therapy response in patients with premalignant endometrial lesions [36] . The epigenetic mechanisms behind PR silencing have been suggested to differ between well differentiated and poorly differentiated endometrial cancer cell lines. Also, in early stage and grade endometrial cancer lesions miRNA seems important in post-transcriptional repression of PR [37] . Recently HAND2 methylation has emerged as a key step in the early endometrial carcinogenesis [38] . Aberrant DNA methylation is already detected in normal endometrial samples from women with CAH, and has been suggested as a biomarker of early detection of endometrial cancer. HAND2 is influenced by progesterone, also supported by the finding that HAND2 methylation status predicts response to progestin therapy [38] . Still, the clinical value of HAND2 methylation assessment needs to be further investigated. Another recent and interesting observation is that the DNA methylation status of the testis specific gene CTCFL/BORIS is linked to the level of PR expression in endometrial cancer and premalignant lesions, however causality needs to be explored [39] .The preoperative distinction between premalignant and low grade malignant endometrial lesions is challenging, and the reproducibility of the diagnosis have been found to be low, even among expert pathologist [7, 8] . The preoperative diagnostic criteria applied, as well as patient age and lesion characteristic, influence the proportion of undetected carcinoma [40] . Even so, further search for additional biomarkers for clinical use is required. We find Stathmin protein expression to be significantly higher in endometrial carcinomas preoperatively diagnosed as CAH. Also high pStathmin(S38) and low PR protein expression tended to be more common in discordant cases. Others have reported significantly lower expression of both ER\u03b1 and PR in patients with concurrent carcinoma [41] . Further, as we demonstrate here, others have also reported assessment of PTEN expression as inadequate in predicting concurrent carcinoma [42] . Likewise, other immunohistochemical patterns including hormone receptors, COX-2, Mlh1 and Bcl-2 have been explored in the clinical setting as potential biomarkers, but without added value to the traditional histology assessment [41, 43] . For premalignant endometrial lesions the morphometric classification system of Endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN) has been suggested as a more objective and reproducible diagnostic tool, and superior to the WHO-system in predicting concurrent carcinoma or cancer progression [44] [45] [46] . This have led to a revised binary modification of the WHO classification recently published, hopefully to improve diagnostic reproducibility [11] .To our knowledge this is the first time CAH lesions have been characterized by WES. Although the number www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget of included patients is small, PIK3CA and PTEN were significantly mutated, in line with earlier reports [47, 48] . Mutations in KRAS and CTNNB1, previously reported to be present in premalignant lesions and thus suggested as early events in the endometrial carcinogenesis [49, 50] , were not detected in our material. This may be due to the relatively small sample set investigated in the current study by WES. Recently CTNNB1 mutation within exon 3 and related Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway activation have been linked to a subgroup of low grade and low stage EEC exhibiting a worse outcome [51] . Ctnnb1 has been demonstrated to be important in normal endometrial epithelial function, and dysregulation has been linked to squamous cell metaplasia in mice [52] . Also, knowing that CTNNB1 is regarded a premalignant phenomenon in endometrial carcinogenesis makes this pathway highly relevant to scrutinize in the premalignant setting in a larger cohort.We validated and expanded the number of cases investigated for PIK3CA mutations by applying Sanger sequencing of the hot spot regions exons 9 and 20. Six PIK3CA mutations in altogether 20 cases with CAH were detected (including one silent mutation in exon 20), of which 10 cases were characterized by WES. In endometrial carcinogenesis PIK3CA mutations have previously been linked to invasion [47] , while high frequency of PIK3CA amplification has been linked to dedifferentiation and aggressive phenotype [16] in line with our present findings. Mutation and amplifications are also considered to be independent events, where both may lead to PI3K pathway activation [15] . In breast carcinoma, apparently in line with our findings in endometrial carcinoma (precursor) lesions, mutation in PIK3CA is assumed to be an early event and associated to favorable prognosis [53, 54] . However, PIK3CA mutations are, by some, regarded as a late event in endometrial carcinogenesis, rarely found in premalignant lesions [47, 48] . In endometrial cancer, the reported effects of PIK3CA mutations are inconsistent, although mostly reported to be unrelated to outcome, also supported by being more frequent in grade 1 EEC compared to higher grade [16, 17, 47] , others have reported specific PIK3CA mutations in exon 20 to associate with adverse prognostic parameters [55] . Our finding of 30% (6/20) of the examined premalignant lesions found to harbor PIK3CA mutations was surprising. Knowing that the distinction between premalignant and malignant lesions in the endometrium is challenging, introduces an uncertainty related to the conclusion. Also for our data, the report generated by one pathologist may be subjective, and such distinction between premalignant and malignant lesions may be inaccurate, although representing the routine clinical practice. Also our assessment of PIK3CA mutations targeted by Sanger sequencing is limited by the fact that only exon 9 and 20 are included. In endometrial cancer, several hot spot mutations are found within these two exons, but they still represent only around half of the PIK3CA mutations reported [56] .PTEN mutations are amongst the most commonly reported genetic alterations in the EEC, and have been reported to associate with favorable survival [57] , although the effect on outcomes remains controversial. Apparently in line with PTEN being a marker for more favorable outcome, loss of PTEN protein expression has been demonstrated to implicate good prognosis in endometrial cancer, especially in obese patients [58, 59] . However conflicting results for protein assessment of PTEN status by IHC in prognostication has diminished its clinical utility [60] . In mice, knockout of PTEN has been demonstrated to be an important early event in the initiation of the endometrial carcinogenesis, possibly also relevant in humans [61] . PTEN mutations have also been reported to be present in a substantial portion of premalignant lesions of the endometrium, however one particular PTEN deficient cell clone is usually not persistent, but frequently replaced by other PTEN deficient clones over time [62, 63] . In our material, loss of PTEN protein expression is more frequent in premalignant lesions, consistent with PTEN loss being an early event, also known to occur in normal endometrium [62, 63] . Our finding that 40% of CAH lesions display PTEN loss is in line with previous reports [64] .PTEN aberrations, both mutations and loss of protein expression, have been demonstrated as preinvasive events [62, 64, 65] . PIK3CA mutations, on the other hand, have been reported to be infrequent or absent in premalignant endometrial lesions [47, 48] . We have here demonstrated molecular changes in PIK3CA and PTEN to be present already in the precursor lesion for EEC, with transcriptional changes in the PI3K pathway activation as early events in the invasive step to grade 1 EEC. These changes from precursor lesions to invasive cancers were confirmed by immunohistochemical staining for Stathmin, supporting the use of this protein as a surrogate marker for PI3K signaling [16, 19] . Mutations in PTEN and PIK3CA often coexist in EEC, and simultaneous mutations in these two genes have been linked to invasion [47] . Nevertheless, we find that two cases with CAH have this combination of mutations.For assessing PTEN status, IHC has been found to be superior to sequencing in detecting loss of function [66] , and in line with this, we find PTEN mRNA expression and protein level to be highly correlated. Thus, our results support that assessment of PI3K signaling and PTEN loss in FFPE tissue, by IHC staining for Stathmin and PTEN, respectively, is valid and more readily available for use in a routine clinical setting.We conclude from the present study, to our knowledge the most comprehensive molecular characterization of specimens ranging from precursors through primary to metastatic EEC lesions, that PTEN mutations and loss, mutations in PIK3CA as well as PI3K and KRAS signaling activation are early events in the development from CAH to EEC, while hormone receptor loss and EMT occur during dedifferentiation. Interestingly, the molecular alterations in precursor lesions are BMI context related. KRAS and immunological activation is predominantly prevalent in obese women, while STMN1 and PI3K signaling activation is prevalent in non-obese women, suggesting different prevention and systemic treatment strategies in obese and non-obese patients.", "citance": "Recently HAND2 methylation has emerged as a key step in the early endometrial carcinogenesis [38] .", "claims": [{"text": "HAND2 methylation is a key step in early endometrial carcinogenesis.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Following ligand interaction with TLRs, TIR serves to both initiate intracellular signaling and facilitate recruitment of signaling adapter proteins to the intracytoplasmic domain. Although TLR TIR is central to a number of TLR signaling cascades, its role in sensory neurons is poorly understood. In this study we investigated the degree to which TLR TIR decoy peptide modified to include a TAT sequence (Trans-Activator of Transcription gene in HIV; TAT-4BB) affected LPS-induced intracellular calcium flux and excitation in sensory neurons, and behavioral changes due to TLR4 active metabolite, morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) exposure in vivo. TAT-4BB inhibited LPS-induced calcium changes in a majority of sensory neurons and decreased LPS-dependent neuronal excitability in small diameter neurons. Acute systemic administration of the TAT-4BB reversed M3G-induced tactile allodynia in a dose-dependent manner but did not affect motor activity, anxiety or responses to noxious thermal stimulus.

{"s2orc_id": 6310215, "title": "Exosomes in Critical Illness", "abstract": "Objective: Exosomes are small, cell-released vesicles (40\u2013100 nm in size) with the potential to transfer proteins, lipids, small RNAs, messenger RNAs, or DNA between cells via interstitial fluids. Due to their role in tissue homeostasis, exosomes have emerged as a new type of therapeutic and diagnostic (theranostic) tool in the noninvasive assessment of organ response to injury or treatment and in the development of reliable organ-protective intensive therapy. Our review provides current insights into the role of exosomes in the personalized management of injury and repair responses in critical illness. Data Source: Data were obtained from a PubMed search of the most recent medical literature, including the PubMed \u201crelated articles\u201d search methodology. Study Selection: Articles considered include original articles, review articles and conference proceedings. Data Extraction: A detailed review of scientific, peer-reviewed data was performed. Relevant pre-clinical and clinical studies were included and summarized. Data Synthesis: Current scientific evidence is focused on the following: 1) Frontiers in the management of critical illness; 2) Biogenesis, characterization, and function of circulating exosomes; 3) The role of exosomes in acute lung injury; 4) The role of exosomes in acute cardiac injury; 5) The role of exosomes in acute kidney injury; 6) The role of exosomes in sepsis; 7) Limitations of exosome isolation protocols; and 8) Perspectives in the theranostic use of exosomes. Conclusions: Circulating levels of exosomes are associated with the onset and clinical course of critical illness. Exosomes released from cells with different phenotypes exert different functions in order to protect tissue and preserve organ function. Therefore, multifunctional exosomes with combined diagnostic and therapeutic functions show great promise in terms of personalized nanomedicine for patient-specific diagnosis and treatment of critical illness.", "citation_paragraph": "Plasma concentrations of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (HSCT-T) increase following AMI, mostly in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock (40) or in vascular surgery patients (41) . However, HSCT-T dosage may not be diagnostic if the onset of symptoms occurs less than 3 hours before AMI (42) . To overcome this significant limitation, recent investigations have focused on the newly discovered relationship between exosomal miRs and early myocardial injury (43) . Serum levels of cardiac exosomal miRNAs (miR-1 and miR-133a) rapidly increase in the early hours after the onset of AMI (44) . Thus, cardiac exosomal miRNA assays are able to detect AMI much earlier than conventional assays (45) . Although HSCT-T levels are not normally detectable in the urine after AMI, urine cardiac exosomal miRNAs are still measurable (1) . Exosomes are therefore a very versatile clinical indicator of early ischemic cardiac injury during intensive monitoring of critically ill patients. A number of studies are currently underway to characterize the subpopulations of cardiac exosomes. To date, it is known that exosomes secreted by resident adult cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) (CD9+, CD63+, CD81+, heat shock protein 70+, Alix+, and tumor susceptibility gene 101+) are effective in cardioprotection and repair of infarcted hearts (9) . It is conceivable that CPCs are myocardial stress sensors and may regulate the magnitude of the first adaptive response to insults in a dose-and time-dependent manner. In fact, exosomes released by chronically hypoxic CPCs deliver a pool of miRNAs (miR-15b, miR-17, miR-20a, miR-103, miR199a, miR-210, and miR-292) that enhance angiogenesis, reduce profibrotic gene expression, and preserve myocardial contractile function, respectively. Similarly, exosomes released from normoxic CPCs are able to improve cardiac function (33) .Finally, Yang et al (11) have shown that cardiomyocytes exposed to an anaerobic low-glucose culture medium, which is an ischemic-like environment, release exosomes that deliver miR-30a, an anti-apoptotic epigenetic factor, whose levels significantly increase in the serum of AMI patients.", "citance": "However, HSCT-T dosage may not be diagnostic if the onset of symptoms occurs less than 3 hours before AMI (42) .", "claims": [{"text": "HSCT-T dosage may not be diagnostic if the onset of symptoms occurs less than 3 hours before AMI.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "High-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (HSCT-T) dosage may not be diagnostic if the onset of symptoms occurs less than 3 hours before acute myocardial injury (AMI).", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

The purpose of this study was to compare the relationships between HbA1c, FG, and fructosamine in individuals from Senegal with and without SCT. HbA1c, FG, and fructosamine were measured in 203 adults from Senegal (100 control: 45 with type 2 diabetes (T2D); 103 SCT: 51 with T2D). Significant, positive correlations were observed between HbA1c and FG, fructosamine and FG, and fructosamine and HbA1c in both groups. The limits of agreement were inappropriately large in both groups for the Bland-Altman plots of HbA1c and FG (control: -95.97 to 83.97%; SCT: -115.9 to 91.52%), fructosamine and FG (control: -100.6 to 99.89%; SCT: -105.6 to 100.6%), and fructosamine and HbA1c (control: -52.03 to 38.98%; SCT: -88.04 to 71.41%). In both groups, the greatest proportion of subjects were considered above the clinical cut-point for hyperglycemia when fructosamine was used as the criterion (control: 33%; SCT: 44.6%), and the lowest percentage of subjects were classified as over the clinical cut-point when HbA1c was used as the criterion (control: 21%; SCT: 27.7%).Substantial disparities between HbA1c, FG, and fructosamine were observed in both groups, and these differences were exaggerated in the SCT group. Therefore, these three biomarkers should not be considered to be interchangeable measures of glycemic control. These biomarkers should be used thoughtfully, and special care should be taken when using them in individuals with SCT.", "citation_paragraph": "The primary finding of the study is that although HbA1c, FG, and fructosamine were significantly and positively correlated in both the control and SCT groups, analyses of agreement revealed considerable disparity between the three biomarkers of hyperglycemia. Furthermore, these differences were particularly evident in the SCT group. These results suggest that these biomarkers are not interchangeable, and should be interpreted carefully, especially in individuals with SCT.The correlational analyses showed moderate associations between HbA1c and FG and between fructosamine and FG, as well as fairly strong associations between HbA1c and fructosamine in both groups. Additional analyses showed that HbA1c and fructosamine were significantly associated in individuals with diabetes in both groups. These findings correspond with multiple studies that have found significant, positive associations between HbA1c, fructosamine, and FG in individuals with and without diabetes [5, [15] [16] [17] [18] . However, our findings that fructosamine and FG were associated in people with diabetes in the SCT group only, while HbA1c and FG were not associated in subjects with diabetes in either group, conflict with these previous findings [5, [15] [16] [17] [18] .Furthermore, our results coincide with the findings of a study by Jurascheck et al, which also observed a stronger correlation between fructosamine and HbA1c than fructosamine and FG or HbA1c and FG [12] . In addition, as has been observed in other studies, none of the biomarkers of glycemia were very strongly correlated in the current study [5] . This could be due to the physiological differences between the three biomarkers (such as the differences in half Clinical cut-points were set at 126 mg/dL for FG, 6.5% for HbA1c, and 260 \u03bcmol for fructosamine. life of HbA1c and fructosamine), as well as other sources of biological and analytical variability [5, 6] . Correlation analysis evaluates the linear correlation between two measures, and does not automatically imply good agreement. For this reason, Bland-Altman plots were used to interpret the bias, data scatter, and agreement between HbA1c and FG, fructosamine and FG, and HbA1c and fructosamine for both groups. The Bland-Altman analyses revealed that the LOA between all of the measures were unacceptably large in both groups. Interestingly, the LOA tended to be larger in the SCT group compared to the control group. This phenomenon was particularly evident in the comparisons of HbA1c and fructosamine. Overall, the analyses of agreement revealed considerable disparities between the three biomarkers of hyperglycemia, and these differences were heightened in the SCT group. These disparities suggest that these biomarkers should not be considered to be interchangeable measures of hyperglycemia. Use of only one of these biomarkers could possibly result in an erroneous assessment of blood glucose control, potentially leading to missed diagnoses or inappropriate follow-up of T2D. Furthermore, there was a moderate tendency for the bias to become more negative, and more variable, as glycemic control became worse. These results indicate that the disparities between the three measures may be the most pronounced in the patients who have the poorest glycemic control.Variability between HbA1c and other markers of glycemia has been widely reported, especially in populations of African decent [19] [20] [21] . For example, a study conducted by Bergenstal and colleagues in 2017 concluded that HbA1c overestimates average glucose in black individuals versus white individuals, likely because of racial differences in hemoglobin glycation [19] . However, accumulating evidence suggests that hemoglobin glycation could be more heavily influenced by inter-individual variability than by race or ethnicity, due to a variety of factors like differences in extra-and intra-cellular glucose balance, non-glycemic genetic determinants of hemoglobin glycation, and red blood cell survival [20, 22] . Additionally, evidence shows that HbA1c can be affected by sex, however no differences in average HbA1c were observed between the male and female subjects in the control or SCT groups in this study [23] .Disparities between HbA1c and fructosamine have been observed in several other studies [16] [17] [18] 24] . Indeed, Macdonald et al compared measured HbA1c to estimated HbA1c from fructosamine values in 1744 patients and found a substantial difference between the two measures, leading to the conclusion that HbA1c may not accurately reflect glucose control [24] . Similarly, Narbonne et al found that estimating HbA1c from fructosamine values did not provide an accurate enough measure of glucose control to evaluate the efficacy of diabetic treatments [17] . Furthermore, studies conducted by Nayak et al and Cohen et al have shown that the discordance between HbA1c and fructosamine, referred to as the glycation gap, remains consistent within subjects and is positively associated with nephropathy, a common diabetesrelated complication [18] . These studies suggest that the consistent disparities between HbA1c (a measure of intracellular glycation) and fructosamine (a measure of extra-cellular glycemic control) could be relevant to the pathophysiology of diabetes-related vascular complications [16, 18] . A growing body of research shows that SCT increases the risk of chronic kidney disease and end stage renal disease [25, 26] . Additionally, a recent study by Diaw et al found that subjects with SCT and T2D had a higher frequency of microalbuminuria compared to control subjects and subjects with SCT or T2D [27] . More studies should be done to determine whether the exaggerated discrepancies between HbA1c and fructosamine observed in the SCT group could be linked to an increased risk of nephropathy. The lack of agreement between the three biomarkers of hyperglycemia, which was more pronounced in the SCT group, was reflected by the inconsistency in the number of subjects classified as above the clinical cut-point depending on the criterion used. For example, when HbA1c was used as the criterion, fewer subjects were classified as above the clinical cut-point than when FG or fructosamine were used, and the differences were larger in the SCT group. These results are in accordance with a study by Guo et al, which concluded that the accuracy of HbA1c varied among subjects, resulting in many missed diagnoses when used as a sole diagnostic criterion [21] . Multiple studies have suggested that using multiple biomarkers of hyperglycemia may be the best way to improve the accuracy of blood glucose monitoring and T2D diagnosis [5, 6, 22, 28, 29] . More research should be performed to understand the potential benefits of using multiple biomarkers to measure glycemic control in people with SCT.The inclusion of individuals with T2D was a strength of the present study as it enabled us to evaluate the relationships between the three biomarkers over a large range of glucose control. Another strength of the study was that HbA1c was measured using the Sebia Capillarys 3 Tera device, a method that shows no interference from HbS, or other common hemoglobin variants according to the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) [30] . However, it is worth recognizing that the findings of Lacy et al suggest that HbA1c may consistently underestimate glycemic control in black individuals with SCT [31] . Additionally, a recent study reported that the number of functional alpha-genes in individuals with alpha-thalassemia could affect HbA1c values [32] . In this study, subjects were not tested for alpha-thalassemia. Therefore, future studies could be conducted to study the performance of HbA1c, fructosamine, and FG in individuals with SCT and alphathalassemia.", "citance": "However, it is worth recognizing that the findings of Lacy et al suggest that HbA1c may consistently underestimate glycemic control in black individuals with SCT [31] .", "claims": [{"text": "HbA1c consistently overestimates glycemic control in black individuals with Sickle cell trait (SCT).", "subject": "HbA1c", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "HbA1c consistently underestimates glycemic control in black individuals with Sickle cell trait (SCT).", "subject": "HbA1c", "is_negation": false}]}

Several studies have reported an association between migraine and brain white matter lesions or clinically silent infarct-like abnormalities in the posterior circulation territory. The origin of these lesions is still unclear. The cause is commonly interpreted as ischemic, which is consistent with the association of migraine, particularly with aura, with vascular risk factors. The relationship between increased volume of white matter hyperintensities and a history of severe headache per se is under debate. The clinical relevance of this brain damage deserves further investigations even if an association between cognitive impairment and migraine or headache of any type is not confirmed.", "citation_paragraph": "To improve the knowledge on this exciting topic, future studies have to elucidate whether progression of migraine (from sporadic to high frequency of attacks) could lead to increase of brain lesions (rate of developing new lesions and progression of lesions over time), considering a possible relationship between migraine attack rate and progression of lesion load. Furthermore, functional consequences of brain lesions have to be evaluated (in long term, considering cognitive changes). Information about regional brain perfusion values and permeability of blood-brain barrier could be of particular interest in studying migraine activity correlations with brain lesions. A recent paper confirmed that any history of severe headache was associated with an increased volume of white matter hyperintensities, whereas migraine with aura was the only headache type associated with brain infarcts. These data are of particular interest because they extend our knowledge on the association between non-migraine headache and white matter hyperintensities. Further studies on this topic are warmly suggested, considering white matter lesions in headache a puzzling and yet unresolved question. Nevertheless, evidence that headache of any type by itself or in association with brain lesions was correlated with cognitive impairment was lacking [27] . More specific systematic reviews and meta-analysis are requested to provide evidence on increased disease risk of vascular disorders and cognitive decline in headache patients with white matter hyperintensities [28] . From a practical point of view, at this moment we have no robust data to state that migraine has hazardous effects on the brain.

Although many people living with HIV are adhering well, others struggle and most are likely to experience challenges in adherence that may threaten virologic suppression at some point during lifelong therapy. Despite the importance of ART adherence, supportive interventions have generally not been implemented at scale. The objective of this review is to summarize the recommendations of clinical, research, and public health experts for scalable ART adherence interventions in resource-limited settings.   METHODS In July 2015, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation convened a meeting to discuss the most promising ART adherence interventions for use at scale in resource-limited settings. This article summarizes that discussion with recent updates. It is not a systematic review, but rather provides practical considerations for programme implementation based on evidence from individual studies, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and the World Health Organization Consolidated Guidelines for HIV, which include evidence from randomized controlled trials in low- and middle-income countries. Interventions are categorized broadly as education and counselling; information and communication technology-enhanced solutions; healthcare delivery restructuring; and economic incentives and social protection interventions. Each category is discussed, including descriptions of interventions, current evidence for effectiveness, and what appears promising for the near future. Approaches to intervention implementation and impact assessment are then described.   RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The evidence base is promising for currently available, effective, and scalable ART adherence interventions for resource-limited settings. Numerous interventions build on existing health care infrastructure and leverage available resources. Those most widely studied and implemented to date involve peer counselling, adherence clubs, and short message service (SMS). Many additional interventions could have an important impact on ART adherence with further development, including standardized counselling through multi-media technology, electronic dose monitoring, decentralized and differentiated models of care, and livelihood interventions. Optimal targeting and tailoring of interventions will require improved adherence measurement.   CONCLUSION The opportunity exists today to address and resolve many of the challenges to effective ART adherence, so that they do not limit the potential of ART to help bring about the end of AIDS.", "citation_paragraph": "The organization of people, institutions, and resources that deliver healthcare, referred to broadly as healthcare delivery systems, can affect adherence [119] [120] [121] [122] . For example, long wait times at clinics, fragile supply chains leading to stock outs, or extended travel to clinics can make it difficult to obtain care and avoid treatment interruptions. Patient interactions with healthcare workers can also influence adherence [123] [124] [125] . In many RLS, healthcare delivery systems remain poorly equipped to provide long-term chronic disease care, including HIV care many are overburdened by high patient loads and limited resources [126] . This burden has increased with rapid ART scale-up, more inclusive ART eligibility, and plateaus in international funding [127] .Improvements in structural, logistical, and interpersonal elements of healthcare delivery can improve the overall efficiency of crowded service delivery centers. For example, decentralized services decrease the demands on patients for care seeking, such as transportation and time away from work [128] . Other techniques, such as point-of-care CD4 count testing [129] and integration of related services (e.g. antenatal care and PMTCT programmes; tuberculosis and HIV treatment programmes [130, 131] ), improve linkage to and retention in care. Likewise, emerging interventions such as differentiated models of care (discussed below) are designed to improve efficacy of treatment programs. While not necessarily targeting adherence, these interventions enable better care delivery.", "citance": "This burden has increased with rapid ART scale-up, more inclusive ART eligibility, and plateaus in international funding [127] .Improvements in structural, logistical, and interpersonal elements of healthcare delivery can improve the overall efficiency of crowded service delivery centers.", "claims": [{"text": "Healthcare delivery efficiency in crowded delivery centers is enhanced by improving structural, logistical, and interpersonal elements.", "subject": "Healthcare delivery efficiency", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Healthcare delivery efficiency in crowded delivery centers is impaired by improving structural, logistical, and interpersonal elements.", "subject": "Healthcare delivery efficiency", "is_negation": true}]}
{"s2orc_id": 23168282, "title": "Helicobacter pylori-induced inflammation and epigenetic changes during gastric carcinogenesis.", "abstract": "The sequence of events associated with the development of gastric cancer has been described as \"the gastric precancerous cascade\". This cascade is a dynamic process that includes lesions, such as atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia. According to this model, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection targets the normal gastric mucosa causing non-atrophic gastritis, an initiating lesion that can be cured by clearing H. pylori with antibiotics or that may then linger in the case of chronic infection and progress to atrophic gastritis. The presence of virulence factors in the infecting H. pylori drives the carcinogenesis process. Independent epidemiological and animal studies have confirmed the sequential progression of these precancerous lesions. Particularly long-term follow-up studies estimated a risk of 0.1% for atrophic gastritis/intestinal metaplasia and 6% in case of dysplasia for the long-term development of gastric cancer. With this in mind, a better understanding of the genetic and epigenetic changes associated with progression of the cascade is critical in determining the risk of gastric cancer associated with H. pylori infection. In this review, we will summarize some of the most relevant mechanisms and focus predominantly but not exclusively on the discussion of gene promoter methylation and miRNAs in this context.", "citation_paragraph": "During gastric cancer progression and similar to other types of cancer, chronic inflammation leads to epigenetic changes characterized by the hypermethylation of driver tumor-suppressor genes, as well as passenger genes, and the hypomethylation of repetitive DNA sequences generating genomic instability [20, 28] . Consistent with these observations, dietary supplementation with folic acid (a methyl donor) prevented the decrease in global DNA methylation as well as gastric dysplasia and mucosal inflammation observed during H. pylori-associated carcinogenesis in mice [29] . However, for an important proportion of gastric cancers mutations in tumor suppressor genes are also detected, indicating that this type of cancer originates not only as an epigenetic disease. For instance, mutations, particularly in genes like TP53, APC, CTNNB1, CDH1 and KRAS are frequently observed in gastric cancer [30] . Inflammatory processes initiated in response to H. pylori infection are accompanied by the formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/NOS), predominantly by activated neutrophils, macrophages and gastric cells in response to bacterial factors [31, 32] ( Figure 1) . As a consequence, elevated levels of oxidized proteins and fragmented DNA are detected in the gastric mucosa [31] . Nitric oxide produced by inducible oxide synthase (iNOS) increases early in the infected mucosa and, as a consequence, DNA adducts, such as 8-nitroguanine and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG or 8-OHdG) are readily detected in humans and animal models [33, 34] . Another mechanism that contributes to mutagenesis of host DNA is the H. pylori-induced aberrant NF-\u03baB-dependent expression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), an enzyme that functions as a DNA-and RNAediting enzyme in response to H. pylori infection [35] . Upregulation of AID favored nucleotide alterations in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene in gastric cells in vitro, and similar alterations were also detected in the gastric mucosa of infected patients [35, 36] . Studies in animal models indicate that oxidative stress is an important contributing factor to gastric carcinogenesis. For instance, nutritional supplementation with sulphoraphane, a natural compound and activator of the antioxidant transcriptional factor Nrf2, was shown to protect mice against gastric pathologies induced by H. pylori infection [37] . Furthermore, similar results were obtained upon supplementation with antioxidants like ascorbic acid in humans [38] . A possible explanation for these observations is that ROS/NOS are responsible for methylation of antioxidant enzyme genes [20] . Also, it is important to consider that ROS accumulation produces directly epigenetic changes. For instance, the host DNA because no additional factors are required for enzymatic activity. Relevant examples in this context is m6A or m4C modifications that normally are not considered in current studies [40, 41] . Also, epidemiological and basic research data all point towards a number of bacterial factors as being responsible for the observed gastric inflammation, deregulation of cellular signaling pathways and cancer. Some 60% of Western H. pylori isolates bear a cag pathogenicity island (cagPAI) [11] , which encodes among other components a type \u2163 secretion system (T4SS) that is able to transfer macromolecules, peptidoglycans and DNA into the host cells [42] (Figure 1 ). The presence and functionality of the cagPAI correlates very strongly with the development of peptic ulcer and gastric cancer [43] . Interestingly, NF-\u03baB activation is found to be dependent on an intact T4SS secretion system [44] . For instance, one study showed that peptidoglycans injected by the T4SS apparatus were responsible for NF-\u03baB activation via the intracellular pathogen recognition receptor NOD1 [45] . As mentioned previously, Mongolian gerbils infected free radical adducts have been shown to alter DNA cytosine methylation [39] and NO can enhance DNMT activity [25] . In addition to the direct effects of H. pylori on gastric epithelial cells, the infection activates macrophages, which increase NO production and NO levels in gastric epithelial cells. NO can activate DNA methyltransferase 1 (host DNMT1) to promote DNA methylation in several gene promoter regions; C: Also H. pylori DNA Methyltransferases (Hp DNMTs) may directly promote host DNA methylation in the promoter regions of several genes thought to function as tumor suppressors in gastric cancer. Moreover, infection is associated with promoter methylation and decreased expression of miR210, a miRNA which targets mRNAs implicated in stem cell survival, stalling of the DNA repair system, induction of angiogenesis and cellular differentiation, among others.", "citance": "Another mechanism that contributes to mutagenesis of host DNA is the H. pylori-induced aberrant NF-\u03baB-dependent expression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), an enzyme that functions as a DNA-and RNAediting enzyme in response to H. pylori infection [35] .", "claims": [{"text": "Helicobacter pylori-induced aberrant NF-kB-dependent expression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase contributes to the mutagenesis of host DNA.

During mixed infections or cancer, macrophages are often exposed to both cytokines, but how these two programs influence each other remains unclear. We found that IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 mutually inhibited the epigenomic and transcriptional changes induced by each cytokine alone. Computational and functional analyses revealed the genomic bases for gene-specific cross-repression. For instance, while binding motifs for the transcription factors STAT1 and IRF1 were associated with robust and IL-4-resistant responses to IFN-\u03b3, their coexistence with binding sites for auxiliary transcription factors such as AP-1 generated vulnerability to IL-4-mediated inhibition. These data provide a core mechanistic framework for the integration of signals that control macrophage activation in complex environmental conditions.", "citation_paragraph": "extreme poles of a broad spectrum of macrophage activation states 2 and were named after the cytokines specifically produced by T H 1 and T H 2 lymphocyte subsets 3, 4. While the M1 program is typically associated with a pro-inflammatory phenotype and high microbicidal activity, M2 macrophages are linked to resistance to helminths and tissue repair 5, 6 . Although the characterization of these two functional extremes has greatly contributed to advance our understanding of macrophage biology, several elements of complexity must be taken into consideration. First, macrophage activation states are in principle as diverse as the variety of stimuli these cells can be exposed to 2. Second, such activation states, although associated with some forms of cellular memory 7, 8, 9, do not drive terminal and irreversible differentiation programs, implying the possibility of inter-conversion between macrophage states when micro-environmental conditions change 10. Third, macrophages are exposed to multiple and often conflicting micro-environmental stimuli that may impact their biology in a complex fashion 11.Co-existence of antagonistic signals impacting on macrophage function is frequently observed in vivo. Upon co-infection with pathogens eliciting type 1 and type 2 immunity (such as viruses and helminths, respectively), the pathways leading to IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3 release are concomitantly activated and the interplay between these conflicting programs has important biological consequences. The activation of an IL-4-dependent type 2 immune response to helminths results in a broad spectrum of immune-regulatory and suppressive effects 12, 13 that also depend on myeloid cells 14, 15 . Consistently, epidemiological data indicate that helminths interfere with the ability of the immune system to control coinfections by microbial pathogens 16 and macrophages activated by IL-4 favor Mycobacterium tuberculosis replication 17, 18 . Similar occurrences are observed in conditions whereby a single pathogen, such as Leishmania major, concomitantly triggers M1 and M2 responses 19. Furthermore, both in tumors and during the resolution phase of inflammation, macrophages are co-exposed to pro-and anti-inflammatory signals driving concomitant and frequently co-existing M1 and M2 profiles 20. Collectively, these observations highlight the need to dissect the relationships between multiple environmental signals to understand their impact on macrophage biology.Here, we set out to address some critical and basic aspects of macrophage polarization, namely whether the M1 and M2 polarization programs are mutually exclusive; whether one of the two programs is dominant over the other and finally what are the mechanisms underlying the cross-talk between M1 and M2 polarizing stimuli. Transcriptional and epigenomic profiling of macrophages treated with IL-4, IFN-\u03b3 or their combination showed that either cytokine exerted inhibitory effects on the opposite activation program. These effects were of broad amplitude but in most cases of limited magnitude, indicating lack of mutual exclusivity of the M1 and M2 programs and a high degree of macrophage plasticity. However, induction of selected genes with critical biological roles as well as hundreds of enhancers characteristic of either program was strongly suppressed upon co-stimulation. While STAT1 and IRF1 binding were associated with resistance of IFN-\u03b3-responsive enhancers to IL-4-mediated inhibition, the involvement of auxiliary transcription factors, such as AP-1 and C/EBP\u03b2, generated vulnerability to the inhibitory effects of IL-4.

Access and analysis of the growing amount of freely available transcriptomics datasets for SCs, however, are not trivial tasks. Here, we present StemMapper, a manually curated gene expression database and comprehensive resource for SC research, built on integrated data for different lineages of human and mouse SCs. It is based on careful selection, standardized processing and stringent quality control of relevant transcriptomics datasets to minimize artefacts, and includes currently over 960 transcriptomes covering a broad range of SC types. Each of the integrated datasets was individually inspected and manually curated. StemMapper's user-friendly interface enables fast querying, comparison, and interactive visualization of quality-controlled SC gene expression data in a comprehensive manner. A proof-of-principle analysis discovering novel putative astrocyte/neural SC lineage markers exemplifies the utility of the integrated data resource.

The salient need to facilitate exploration of the accumulated data has led to the development of StemMapper.With its described features, StemMapper further complements and extends the repertoire of existing online resources for gene expression in SCs. These include tools such as ImmGen Gene Skyline (21), Codex (22) , Gene Expression Commons (23), Expression Atlas (24) and Stemformatics (25) , which provide -similarly to StemMapper -access to expression data for a wide range of cell types. Alternatively, online resources have been established to study the gene expression in particular cell lineages, such as, BloodSpot (26), HaemAtlas (27) Like with any other computational tool in biology, certain limitations exist for StemMapper. One of the most prominent is the undertaken selection of a particular transcriptomics platform, i.e. in our case Affymetrix GeneChips, as primary source for gene expression data. While this restriction is likely to enhance the comparability of measurements across different experiments, it led to the exclusion of data generated by other relevant technologies such as RNA-seq. For a future version, we therefore plan to integrate SC expression profiles from other transcriptomics platforms in StemMapper. Although cross-platform data integration is challenging, recent analysis indicate that such integration through appropriate data transformation is feasible (30) . This extension of StemMapper will also enable the user to upload transcriptomics data generated by different microarray or sequencing technologies.Furthermore, we envision the inclusion of single cell expression profiles, as these type of data provide a more precise view of the molecular heterogeneity of SCs which might be masked by the analysis of cell populations (31) . In fact, it should be noted that many of the included transcriptomics data sets for SCs do not represent expression profiles of pure cell populations, but rather of cell populations enriched by a particular SC type. For instance, it has been estimated that many purification strategies for hematopoietic SCs only reach a purity rate of up to 50%, despite haematopoiesis being one of the most intensively studied models in SC biology (12) . Another enhancement of StemMapper will be the inclusion of marker genes that are more discriminative on transcript level. At the moment, we provide pre-compiled lists of markers that are at least partially based on observed protein abundance and thus might not be optimal for classification of transcriptomic data. Finally, we plan to link StemMapper to other computational resources developed in our group for SC biology analysis, i.e. StemCellNet (32) and StemChecker (33) enabling the user to conduct a multitude of complementary in silico analyses within the domain of SC biology.", "citance": "For instance, it has been estimated that many purification strategies for hematopoietic SCs only reach a purity rate of up to 50%, despite haematopoiesis being one of the most intensively studied models in SC biology (12) .", "claims": [{"text": "Hematopoietic Stem Cell purification reaches purity rate of up to 50%.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Hematopoietic Stem Cell purification reaches purity rates above 90%.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}

Currently, there are no curative therapies for millions of chronic HBV-infected patients (Lok et al., 2017). Interferon (IFN; including pegylated IFN) is an approved anti-HBV drug that not only exerts direct antiviral activity, but also augments immunity against HBV infection. Through a systematic review of the literature, here we summarize and present recent progress in research regarding the interactions between IFN and HBV as well as dissect the antiviral mechanisms of IFN. We focus on inhibition of HBV replication by IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) as well as inhibition of IFN signaling by HBV and viral proteins. Finally, we briefly discuss current IFN-based HBV treatment strategies. This review may help to better understand the mechanisms involved in the therapeutic action of IFN as well as the crosstalk between IFN and HBV, and facilitate the development of both direct-acting and immunology-based new HBV drugs.", "citation_paragraph": "In response to viral infection, IFN production can be efficiently induced in many types of cells by the activation of patternrecognition receptors. Activation of type I IFN family genes constitutes one of the earliest transcriptional responses, perhaps representing the most important innate immune response to viral infection. Most nucleated vertebrate cells are able to both produce and respond to type I IFN. The detection of intracellular microbial DNA and RNA in macrophages and/or infected cells is critical to elicit an appropriate innate immune response. During viral infection, virus-derived nucleic acids (both RNA and DNA) are mainly sensed by certain cytosolic pattern-recognition receptors. For instance, viral RNA is recognized by retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors, including RIG-I (Pichlmair et al., 2006; Myong et al., 2009 ) and melanoma differentiation associated protein 5 Akira, 2008, 2009 ), leading to its association with the mitochondrial antiviralsignaling protein (MAVS). DNA is sensed by DEAD-box protein (DDX) 41, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), and \u03b3-IFNinducible protein 16 (IFI16) (Unterholzner et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2013; Bhat and Fitzgerald, 2014) , all of which lead to the activation of stimulator of IFN genes (STING). Both MAVS recruitment and STING activation after RNA or DNA viral infection lead to TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) phosphorylation and activation of IFN regulatory factors (IRFs), which are primarily responsible for IFN production (Sato et al., 2000) . Cytosolic RNA polymerase III is specialized to detect foreign and aberrant DNA, which is converted into RNA. RNA synthesized in the cytosol contains 5 -triphosphate, which can be detected by RIG-I. Therefore, RNA polymerase III can act as a DNA sensor that triggers the innate immune response through the RIG-I pathway (Chiu et al., 2009 ; Figure 3) .The antiviral function of type I IFN is cascaded via binding to type I IFN receptor (IFNAR1), activating the Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway, and subsequently inducing approximately 300 ISGs (Ivashkiv and Donlin, 2014) .

Herein we identify predictors for viral decline in a cohort of HCV-infected postpartum women.   Methods Pregnant women at Cairo University were screened for anti-HCV antibodies and HCV RNA, and viremic women were tested for quantitative HCV RNA at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months postpartum. Spontaneous clearance was defined as undetectable viremia twice at least 6-months apart. Associations between viral load and demographic, obstetrical, HCV risk factors, and interleukin-28B gene (IL28B) polymorphism (rs12979860) were assessed.   Results Of 2514 women, 97 (3.9%) had anti-HCV antibodies, 54 (2.1%) were viremic and of those, 52 (2.1%) agreed to IL28B testing. From pregnancy until 12 months postpartum, IL28B-CC allele women had a significant viral decline (P = .009). After adjusting, the IL28B-CC allele had a near significant difference compared to the CT allele (odds ratio [OR], 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75,1.00; P = .05), but not the TT allele (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.61,1.38; P = .64). All 14/52 (26.9%) women who subsequently cleared were among the 15 with undetectable viremia at 12 months, making that time point a strong predictor of subsequent clearance (sensitivity = 100%, specificity = 97.4%, positive predictive value = 93.3%, negative predictive value = 100%).   Conclusions IL28B-CC genotype and 12-month postpartum undetectable viremia were the best predictors for viral decline and subsequent clearance. These 2 predictors should influence clinical decision making.", "citation_paragraph": "These results describe the largest reported cohort of HCVinfected women with postpartum spontaneous resolution. In this cohort, the IL28B favorable CC genotype was the single best predictor for a significant postpartum drop in viral load by 12 months, which was, in turn, a predictor for subsequent spontaneous viral clearance. We were able to leverage several key advantages to obtain these results, including high local seroprevalence, busy obstetric service with a large catchment area, and an existing study infrastructure that was conducting universal HCV screening during prenatal care. The inclusion of more than 50 viremic pregnant women who could be prospectively followed has previously only been possible in studies Model 1 is unadjusted; model 2 adjusts for age, log baseline viral load, and number of full-term births; and model 3 adjusts for the same variables in model 2 as well as risk factors for infection. Cells with data too sparse to be calculated were excluded from the adjusted model (history of preterm births, working in the health sector, history of jaundice, history of liver disease, history of needle-stick injury, history of tattoos, history of endoscopy, history of renal dialysis, and history of intravenous injection with needle sharing). The variable \"having children who are currently alive\" strongly correlated with \"number of full-term births\" and was also excluded from the model. ORs were estimated using logistic regression. P values derived using permutation tests based on 5000 permutations. CIs were derived using 5000 bootstrap replicates.Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; OR, odds ratio. a 14 women spontaneously cleared their chronic HCV infection and 38 remained persistently infected. conducted over many years across multiple institutions [1, 4, 26] . In contrast, these data were collected over 2 years at just 1 institution [18, 27] . The postpartum period has been previously recognized as a window for spontaneous resolution. While a nonpregnant adult has an exceedingly low chance for spontaneous resolution, small studies have demonstrated a spontaneous clearance rate of up to 20% [8, 9] . More detailed studies have described a pattern of declines in HCV RNA levels in the postpartum period [10] . Immunologic analyses on a subset of women have shown that after the \"immune tolerant\" setting of pregnancy, there is a tremendous surge of HCV-specific T cells and increased immune activity targeted against the virus [10] . None of these prior studies had more than a few women with spontaneous resolution, so no analysis of specific risk factors could be performed.The association of the favorable IL28B genotype in nonpregnant adults was first identified as part of a genome-wide association study in adults with sustained response to IFN therapy [11] . It was then associated with spontaneous resolution of acute HCV infection [12] and a better response to IFN/ ribavirin treatment when it was started early [28, 29] . IL28B induces IFN-\u03bb and mediates the innate immune response to RNA viruses that is distinct from IFN-\u03b1 [30] . Studies that examined the intrahepatic gene expression of patients with sustained response to pegylated-IFN therapy compared to those patients who were nonresponders or relapsers showed that those with favorable IL28B genotypes had lower baseline IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression [31] . The approval of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents against HCV has diminished the role of IL28B significantly, as virtually all patients respond to therapy. However, when treating genotype 1b with sofosbuvir/ledipasvir in patients with a favorable CC allele, current American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines allow for a shortened 8-week course at the discretion of the practitioner [32] [33] [34] .The role of IL28B in HCV-infected pregnant women is related to how their immune system must become tolerant to the foreign antigens in the fetus [35] . There is a shift from a Th-1 to a Th-2 bias in the immune responses (which explains the improvement in autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and autoimmune hepatitis), along with a suppression of HCV-specific T cells and a rise in HCV RNA during pregnancy [10] . After delivery, the immune system shifts back to the Th-1 bias, which is accompanied by a surge in HCV-specific T cells. In a postpartum HCV-infected woman who has the favorable IL28B genotype, prior data would suggest that she has relatively low baseline expression of ISG in her liver [31] . These genes would then respond to cytokine signals secreted during the HCV-specific T-cell surge in the postpartum period. Future studies are necessary to prove this hypothesis.Given these results, what role would IL28B testing play in the care of pregnant women with HCV? In ideal circumstances, every patient with chronic infection would be treated with DAAs, and virtually all would clear their infection. In reality, there is a constant triage when selecting patients who would benefit most from therapy. Given that women with the unfavorable IL28B genotype are unlikely to spontaneously resolve their infection in the postpartum period, they would be the ones most likely to benefit from therapy, thereby eliminating their viremia and the risk of vertical transmission in future pregnancies. Based on our findings, those with the CC genotype are likely to have the steepest viral load decline and subsequently clear more often. Regardless of genotype, the women who had an undetectable viral load level by 12 months were most likely to spontaneously clear, while those who had viremia were unlikely to improve after that time point.Hence, it seems that women should be followed in the postpartum period until at least 12 months after delivery, thus saving the cost and effort of a treatment course. This triage by viral load at 12 months and by IL28B genotype may help more patients get treated in resource-poor settings where DAAs are either not available or available but, even when discounted to the local price, is far too expensive, as is the case for Egypt. If the medical community could replicate the natural sequence of tolerance and release of tolerance with the subsequent viral clearance in nonpregnant patients, this knowledge would facilitate production of a vaccine against HCV. There are some limitations to our study, in particular, the sparsity of data in some of the HCV risk factors where there were too few women to elicit a statistically significant difference between the IL28B alleles at the 12-month time point. However, after accounting for the rate of viral load decline, the CC allele had a significantly faster rate of viral load decline, even after adjusting for potential predictors of clearance, indicating its strong association. An important limitation is that we were unable to test for the more predictive rs368234815 variant (IFNL4-\u2206G/TT) [36] . At the start of this study, there was no IL28B testing available in Egypt, and since the Egyptian Ministry of Health and the Cairo University IRB do not allow for shipping samples abroad, we could not perform any additional testing beyond the rs12979860 variant, which was the only commercially available test in Egypt.Another limitation is the possibility that the IL28B distribution in this cohort may not be representative of that in the general Egyptian population. However, while some regional studies describe IL28B distribution in chronic HCV-infected nonpregnant adults [22] [23] [24] [25] , they are small and not representative of the overall population. However, they do offer a very similar distribution to what we observed in our study, with little evidence of departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Furthermore, given that our cohort included all eligible women who went to the antenatal clinic at a major clinical center over a period of 2 years, our cohort most likely constitutes a representative sample of pregnant women from the densely populated Nile Delta of northern Egypt.Finally, we were not able to conduct viral genotyping. However, the predominant genotype in Egyptian patients is genotype 4 (93.1%), with genotypes 1, 2, and 3 accounting for 3.8%, 0%, and 0.8%, respectively [37] . While genotypes 2 and 3 potentially have a higher rate of spontaneous clearance, their proportion in Egyptian patients is so minuscule that we do not expect that it had an impact on our findings.Our study also had several strengths, particularly the large number of HCV-infected women enrolled at a single site over a short time period, the very high acceptance rate to join the study (100%), and excellent follow-up (100%) until completion of the study.In conclusion, we describe the largest cohort of postpartum HCV-infected women who spontaneously resolved their viremia and present evidence that this phenomenon is predictable and can allow for carefully planned studies of immunological changes in similar cohorts that can inform immune therapies and vaccines. This resolution is strongly associated with viral load at 12 months after delivery and the presence of the favorable IL28B genotype. The use of these 2 markers of clearance in the future triage of HCV-infected pregnant women may allow more targeted treatment of patients who are not likely to spontaneously resolve their HCV.

{"s2orc_id": 12909309, "title": "Urban tropospheric ozone increases the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among Belgian postmenopausal women with outdoor activities during summer.", "abstract": "CONTEXT By absorbing sunlight UVB and thereby reducing cutaneous vitamin D photosynthesis, ozone, a common urban pollutant, could cause hypovitaminosis D.   OBJECTIVES The objective of the study was to establish the characteristics and percentage of subjects with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] less than 75 nmol/liter among postmenopausal women engaging in outdoor activities in either Brussels or the countryside.   DESIGN/SETTING This was a cross-sectional study conducted in a university research hospital.   PATIENTS/METHODS Among 249 women consulting for either shoulder tendonitis or lumbar spine osteoarthritis, 121 free of conditions and drugs affecting bone and calcium metabolism completed two food-frequency questionnaires within 15 d and we selected the 85 subjects with retest scores within the +/- 15% of test scores. Other parameters included sun exposure index (SEI), PTH levels, and femoral neck T-score.   RESULTS Urban residents (n = 38) and rural residents (n = 47) did not differ in mean ages, body mass indices, and vitamin D intakes. When compared with rural inhabitants, urban inhabitants were exposed to ozone levels 3 times higher, and despite a higher mean SEI (113 vs. 87; P < 0.001), they had a higher prevalence of 25(OH)D less than 75 nmol/liter (84 vs. 38%). After adjusting for SEI, 25(OH)D was 2-fold higher in rural residents, and after adjusting for 25(OH)D, SEI was 3-fold higher in urban residents. Femoral neck T-scores correlated positively with 25(OH)D and negatively with PTH levels.   CONCLUSIONS Air pollution may be a neglected risk factor for hypovitaminosis D, which is known to compromise several health outcomes. As long as 25(OH)D is greater than 75 nmol/liter, calcium intakes greater than 17.5 mmol/d are unnecessary to prevent elevations in PTH levels.", "citation_paragraph": "Sunlight is an important source of vitamin D (2, 11), but from November to March at latitudes above 35\u00b0N, very little, if any, vitamin D is produced in human skin during exposure to sunlight (15) . Therefore, during June and July in Belgium (latitude, 50\u00b0N), we were surprised to find that 50 of 85 postmenopausal women (59%) had serum 25(OH)D levels less than 75 nmol/liter. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in this population should be even higher during winter because 25(OH)D has a half-life of 2-3 wk (26) . Although comparisons between reports are difficult because of differences in 25(OH)D cutoffs and the 25(OH)D assays used (27) , epidemiological studies conducted in postmenopausal populations at the end of winter have reported that 52% of North American women treated for osteoporosis had 25(OH)D less than 75 nmol/liter (9) and that 39% of ambulatory Spanish women had 25(OH)D less than 37.5 nmol/liter (28) .The prevalence of 25(OH)D less than 75 nmol/liter was much higher in urban residents (32 of 38 or 84%) than in rural residents (18 of 47 or 38%). The factors responsible for this marked difference in the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency between urban dwellers and rural dwellers were not obvious. According to inclusion criteria, urban and rural residents all had daily outdoors activities and were free of diseases and/or drugs influencing vitamin D metabolism and serum 25(OH)D levels (2). Furthermore, in this and previous studies (29, 30) , BMI was negatively associated with 25(OH)D levels, but our urban residents and rural residents did not differ in either their mean BMI or vitamin D intakes.The observation that 25(OH)D levels were positively associated with SEI in urban and rural dwellers supports the contention that skin exposed to sunlight is an important source of vitamin D for many people (2). The mean SEI was moderately (1.3 times) but significantly higher in urban residents, a finding likely to result, at least in part, from differences in lifestyles between urban and rural women in Belgium. When the weather permits, urban residents spend more time outdoors during daylight hours. In contrast, rural women may tend to avoid outdoor activities during peak sunny hours and often must drive to a shopping mall for purchases in which they are protected from sunlight.Furthermore and importantly, our data provide strong, albeit indirect, evidence that the cutaneous synthesis of vitamin D was less efficient in urban than rural residents. To obtain the same 25(OH)D level, urban inhabitants required a SEI about 3-fold higher than that required by rural inhabitants, and, in turn, for any given SEI, the mean 25(OH)D level of urban dwellers was about 2 times lower than that of rural dwellers.The reasons urban and rural residents differed in the efficiency of cutaneous synthesis of vitamin D were not obvious (2, 11) . Although sunscreen use, aging, and skin pigmentation all decrease skin vitamin D synthesis, the two groups did not use topical sunscreens, and both had similar mean ages and skin tones. Furthermore, because the study was conducted during the same months and at the same latitude, the zenith angle by which sunlight penetrates the earth's atmosphere was similar for the two groups, a point worth stressing because this angle dramatically influences the amount of UVB photons reaching the earth's surface and ultimately penetrating the skin (2, 15) .On the other hand, because stratospheric ozone efficiently absorbs solar UVB photons (15, 31) , any increase in the ozone content of the troposphere is likely to reduce the amount of photons penetrating the skin and hence to diminish the cutaneous production of vitamin D (2) . Therefore, the observation that levels of tropospheric ozone were 3 times higher in Brussels than the countryside helps put into perspective an important finding: to obtain the same 25(OH)D level, urban residents required an SEI that was 2-3 times higher than that of rural residents. Of course, definitive proof of the effect of tropospheric ozone on 25(OH)D levels would have required moving the urban residents to the countryside and vice versa, but this approach was impossible for practical reasons. Nevertheless, although there is concern that the decrease in stratospheric ozone contributes to the increasing incidence of skin damage and cancers (31), our observations strongly suggest that, as do dark skin pigmentation and protection of sunexposed skin areas by sunscreens and clothes, tropospheric ozone adversely affects vitamin D status by interfering with skin penetration of UVB.Levels of 25(OH)D required to prevent secondary hyperparathyroidism have been reported to be as low as 45-50 nmol/liter (7, 20) , greater than 100 nmol/liter (8), or around 60 -75 nmol/liter as observed herein and by others (5, 9) . This discrepancy in thresholds for 25(OH)D levels might be related to different factors such as the 25(OH)D assay used (27) , the age-related reduction in renal function (32) , and/or different dietary calcium intakes in study populations (20) . In our study, levels of dietary calcium had no effect on PTH levels in subjects with 25(OH)D greater than 75 nmol/liter, whereas among subjects with 25(OH)D less than 75 nmol/liter, those with a calcium intake less than 17.5 mmol/d had a higher mean PTH level than those with a calcium intake greater than 17.5 mmol/d. Thus, as suggested previously (20) , high dietary calcium intakes may be unnecessary for preventing secondary hyperparathyroidism in subjects with 25(OH)D levels above 75 nmol/liter.It is noteworthy that the femoral neck T score, a strong predictor of fracture risk (33) , was positively associated with 25(OH)D and negatively associated with PTH. Secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with hypovitaminosis D induces and/or exacerbates bone loss (2, 4) , and many elderly patients (75-95%) hospitalized for hip fractures have 25(OH)D levels less than 50 nmol/liter (34) .Our study has several limitations. First, the reported ozone levels are not those experienced by each subject but those experienced by each group as a whole. Second, to reduce the potential unreliability of sun exposure and dietary reports, women were interviewed twice using the same validated questionnaires, and subjects with retest values outside the 85-115% range of test values were discarded. However, even by doing this, we are not sure to have eliminated all unreliable reporters. Third, because we only studied ambulatory, community-dwelling Caucasian women, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency might be even higher in urban non-Caucasians with daily outdoor activities.In conclusion, the high tropospheric ozone content of urban areas is a neglected risk factor for vitamin D deficiency. Considering the important role of vitamin D in bone health and calcium metabolism as well as the possible role of the vitamin in several other health outcomes, including the development of cancer, muscle weakness, insulin resistance, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and several autoimmune diseases (11, 12) , it may be relevant to take air pollution into account when assessing vitamin D requirements and identifying key risk factors associated with suboptimal 25(OH)D levels.", "citance": "Thus, as suggested previously (20) , high dietary calcium intakes may be unnecessary for preventing secondary hyperparathyroidism in subjects with 25(OH)D levels above 75 nmol/liter.", "claims": [{"text": "High dietary calcium intakes are necessary for prevention of secondary hyperparathyroidism in subjects with 25(OH)D levels above 75 nmol/liter.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "High dietary calcium intakes are unnecessary for prevention of secondary hyperparathyroidism in subjects with 25(OH)D levels above 75 nmol/liter.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

METHODS This study had a cross-sectional design. Data were retrospectively collected. We evaluated 72 patients (44 males and 28 females; mean age 59.0\u00b110.3 years) with coronary artery disease. eGFR was calculated with dividing the Cockcroft-Gault formula by body surface area. Direct measurements of aortic blood pressures were utilized to calculate pulse pressure and AP. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to test the relationship between eGFR and AP, independent from potential confounders.   RESULTS eGFR was significantly correlated with age (r=0.489, p<0.001), body surface area (r=0.324, p=0.006), weight (r=0.323, p=0.006), aortic pulse pressure (r=-0.371, p=0.001), and AP (r=-0.469, p<0.001). In multiple linear regression analysis, AP was independently associated with eGFR (p=0.035), beside the age and body surface area. An AP cut-off level of >0.71 had 84% sensitivity and 72% specificity in predicting eGFR of <90 mL/min per 1.72 m2 (receiver-operating characteristic area under curve: 0.851, 95% CI: 0.760-0.942, p<0.001).   CONCLUSION We found an independent relationship between invasively measured AP and eGFR in patients with coronary artery disease. Moreover, a higher AP may predict lower eGFR. These results may be utilized to predict eGFR from AP during invasive procedures.", "citation_paragraph": "In this study, we found that AP or in other words fractional pulse pressure, an invasively measured aortic stiffness surrogate, is independently and inversely associated with eGFR. This study presented supportive data for the correlation between aortic stiffness and normal, mildly, or moderately impaired eGFR. Additionally, this study suggested the utility of fractional pulse pressure as a predictor of eGFR.The evaluation of renal function is crucial in cardiovascular diseases. Measuring the actual GFR is not always feasible or cost effective in daily practice. The estimation of GFR from the serum creatinine level and demographic characteristics by several formulae is widely used in clinical decisions. The validity of the Cockcroft-Gault and Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formulas in estimating GFR was tested in many studies. The MDRD formula loses its accuracy in patients with normal renal function, and a modified CockcroftGault formula considering the body surface area provides a more accurate estimation of GFR (9) . Additionally, in a study Figure 3 . Significant inverse correlation between estimated glomerular filtration rate and aortic pulsatility. eGFR-estimated glomerular filtration rate conducted in a group of heart failure patient, Zamora et al. (10) concluded that body surface area adjusted by the CockcroftGault formula was the most accurate of the three used eGFR formulae (Cockcroft-Gault formula, MDRD, and the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) for the prediction of prognosis. Our study comprised cardiovascular patients with normal or near normal renal functions, and we used the modified Cockcroft-Gault formula, which is calculated by dividing estimated creatinine clearance by body surface area. Atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis share common risk factors. With the stiffening of the aorta, elastic recoil and reservoir capacity decline, resulting in widened pulse pressure and greater pressure fluctuations on vasculature (11) . In particular, high flow organs such as the brain and kidneys are more prone to pulsatile hemodynamic load and thus, microvascular injury (12) . Thus, the relationship between renal function and aortic stiffness has been evaluated in different patient populations using different modalities such as pulse wave velocity (3), aortic augmentation, augmentation index (13, 14) , and renal resistivity index (15) . However, the relationship between invasively measured aortic fractional pulse pressure and eGFR has not been previously evaluated.The aorta, which contains elastin fibers, distends during systole and recoils during diastole and acts like a reservoir throughout the cardiac cycle. Aging and accompanying cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, obesity, impaired glucose metabolism, and dyslipidemia precipitate stiffening and loss of elastic properties of the aorta (16) . In the presence of constant cardiac function and peripheral vascular resistance, pulse pressure rises and diastolic pressure declines with the decrease of aortic compliance. Dividing pulse pressure by mean arterial pressure theoretically omits the effects of cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance. Hence, increased pulse pressure relative to mean pressure is an indicator aortic stiffness (17) . Previous studies have also demonstrated that fractional pulse pressure is related to coronary artery disease extend (18) , coronary artery disease prognosis (19) , and bypass graft patency (20) . In our study, we used invasively measured fractional pulse pressure as the surrogate of aortic stiffness. Although we used a pressure guide wire for the measurement of aortic blood pressure, a well-calibrated fluid-filled pressure system can be used instead. This method is easy to perform and without additional costs during invasive cardiovascular procedures, and invasively measured pressures are more accurate and reliable than brachial measurements through a sphygmomanometer (21) .In clinical practice, an increasing number of patients is undergoing coronary angiography. Not all these patients are preprocedurally evaluated for renal functions for many reasons such as emergency setting. Preexisting renal impairment is an important risk factor for procedure-related complications such as contrast-induced nephropathy (22, 23) . Taking extra care for the susceptible population might reduce the occurrence of this complication. Although it will never replace measuring serum creatinine level, the evaluation of central AP during cardiac catheterization would also present additional clues for the renal function status of these patients. In our study, a fractional pulse pressure value of <0.71 would predict eGFR of >90 mL/min per 1.72 m 2 with 84% sensitivity and 72% specificity. However, further studies are needed to elucidate this relationship.", "citance": "In particular, high flow organs such as the brain and kidneys are more prone to pulsatile hemodynamic load and thus, microvascular injury (12) .", "claims": [{"text": "High flow organs are more likely to get a microvascular injury.

METHODS In 2006/2007 we had repeatedly collected serum, BAL and sputum of 23 healthy smokers and 24 smokers with COPD (GOLD II) and analysed a panel of more than 100 different parameters. In 2012 we reinvited these subjects to assess the change in lung function to enable the investigation of the potential prognostic value of the 2006/2007 markers and to determine the long-term repeatability of selected blood and serum markers. In this follow-up study we performed body-plethysmography, a blood gas analysis and collected blood and urine samples. The change in lung function was compared with 67 markers from BAL, sputum, serum and whole blood that were shown in the 2006/2007 assessment to be repeatable over a 6 week period.   RESULTS We were able to recruit 13 (54%) smokers with COPD and 11 (48%) former healthy smokers that participated in the 2006/2007 study. The decline in lung function was larger in COPD smokers; five of them changed to GOLD III, one to GOLD IV. Two healthy smokers changed to GOLD I. Blood cells, serum von Willebrand factor and alpha-1-antitrypsin showed a good repeatability over 5 years. In COPD smokers a weak correlation between 2006/2007 sputum markers of neutrophilic inflammation and the 5 year change in FEV1/FVC was found.   CONCLUSIONS Our data suggests that inter-individual and group differences are maintained over a five year period. Despite the large panel of markers available for this analysis, a potential prognostic value appears to exist only for some sputum inflammatory markers. If these data can be confirmed in larger COPD cohorts, it would emphasize the value of sputum markers in clinical trials and support the assumption that an anti-inflammatory treatment can have long term benefits in COPD.", "citation_paragraph": "Despite the available large panel of markers from BAL, sputum, serum and blood, evidence for a potential prognostic value was found only for some sputum inflammatory markers. Naturally only low numbers of subjects are available in studies involving invasive procedures like our initial trial in 2006/2007. Therefore, the association of these markers with the decline in lung function has to be interpreted with caution. This is also reflected by the fact, that our interesting observation, that COPD patients with higher serum levels of leptin and IGF2 showed a smaller decline in lung function could not be reproduced in an independent group of COPD patients. For most hematology parameters, however, interindividual and group differences were shown to be stable over a five year period. This was also true for the serum concentration of alpha-1-antitrypsin and von Willebrand-Factor.The lung function decline was larger in smoking COPD patients than in former healthy smokers. The annual decline in these smokers exceeded the average amount reported in the UPLIFT study, the Hokkaido COPD cohort or the study by Higashimoto et al. [2, 12, 13] . These cohorts, however, only included 20-30% active smokers. The annual decline in lung function of the GOLD 2 COPD smokers from the Grosshansdorf cohort was comparable [10] and larger declines in FEV 1 were also reported for active smokers with COPD in the ECLIPSE cohort [14] . Although the rate of individual annual decline in FEV 1 was based on only two measurements several years apart, which could be considered as a limitation of our study, the overall magnitude of the decline rate was in agreement with other studies on actively smoking COPD patients.While the level of sputum neutrophils in 2006/2007 was not related to the change in lung function parameters over the investigated 5 years period, we found several markers associated with neutrophilic airway inflammation in the lung, like sputum IL8, BAL calprotection or sputum MMPs, for which the concentrations in 2006/2007 correlated with a larger decline in lung function. Interestingly, 4 of the 5 sputum markers we choose in the initial analysis [1] to define an inflammatory phenotype to cover more aspects of inflammation than neutrophils alone, were among the markers that showed significant correlations with the lung function decline. Also the inflammatory score itself was significant, however, only available for 8 subjects. Overall the evidence was weak and higher correlation coefficients with lung function decline were found only in subgroups. In addition, the multiple testings have to be considered and therefore this data needs to be interpreted with caution.Blood haematology markers have moved into the focus of biomarker studies. In the SPIROMICS initiative (Subpopulations and intermediate outcome measures in COPD study) blood cell counts and haematology variables were assessed and shown to be related to COPD severity [15] . Our data suggests that inter-individual differences of these markers in smokers with and without COPD persist over a five year period and that these markers show a good repeatability. In 2006/2007 we found differences in anisocytosis, an indicator for anaemia and the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) between healthy smokers and smoking COPD patients. In line with these findings, SPIRIOMICS reported increased levels of haemoglobin, haematocrit, MCV and leukocyte counts in COPD patients [15] . The observed relationship with lung function in healthy smokers of these haematology markers suggests that it might be worth to reevaluate these markers in already available data of large COPD cohorts.A good repeatability was also found for serum A1AT and VWF and the differences in serum concentrations of A1AT, VWF and IL6 between groups were still detectable, despite lower numbers of subjects available. This confirms that these markers play a role in COPD pathogenesis, but do not appear to have any prognostic value.A positive correlation with the lung function decline was found for IGF2 and leptin, suggesting a potential protective role. For leptin this could not be observed in the independent Grosshansdorf COPD GOLD 2 cohort.As no IGF2 data was available for this group, we analysed IGF2 from stored blood samples of 2006. The levels were comparable to the levels detected in fresh samples 2012, suggesting that storage did not have a negative impact. Nevertheless, we failed to find a comparable relationship of this marker with the lung function decline.Our negative findings with respect to the large panel of serum markers we analysed in 2006/2007 is in line with data from the much larger Hokkaido COPD cohort, where only adiponectin (of 52 plasma markers) was reported to relate to the lung function decline over 5 years [5, 13] . In the ECLIPSE study a similar analysis was performed in almost 1800 patients with 7 serum markers [14] . Although significant, only a small effect for CC16 was found; CC16 being responsible for a 4 ml FEV1 decline/year. Using basically the same dataset from the ECLIPSE study Agusti et al. reported that those COPD subjects with persistently high levels of systemic inflammatory markers had a higher incidence of exacerbations and a higher rate of mortality [16] . In addition it was shown in ECLIPSE that considering serum levels of IL6 improves the predictive value of age, BODE and hospitalization history [17] . Similar data has recently been published for the follow up of COPD patients from the Copenhagen City Heart -(2 years) and General Population Study (5 years), were patients with high levels of CRP, fibrinogen and leukocyte count were shown to have a higher risk of exacerbations [18] . Serum CCL-18 levels were also found to be related to mortality in the ECLIPSE cohort [19] . There is quite a large number of plasma markers that was found to be associated with the exacerbation rate in COPD [20] .

{"s2orc_id": 91737208, "title": "Resetting Cell Fate by Epigenetic Reprogramming", "abstract": null, "citation_paragraph": "SCNT was first done by Briggs and Kings in 1952, who transplanted a blastula nucleus into an enucleated egg of the amphibian Rana pipiens [9] . Few years later, Gurdon et al. succeeded by using differentiated Xenopus intestinal epithelial donor nuclei for SCNT [10] . In 1997, the first cloned mammal, Dolly the sheep, was generated [11] , and since then, more than 23 other mammalian species have now been successfully cloned [12] . Normal development of nuclear transplanted (NT) embryos requires recapitulation of the gene expression profile that supports the embryogenesis process by the differentiated donor nucleus. This involves re-activation of pluripotency genes, in particular Oct4, Nanog and Sox2, and repression of somatic lineage genes. In fact, the efficiency of reprogramming by SCNT is generally very low and less than 1% of NT embryos can develop into normal adults [13] [14] [15] . The cloned newborns often suffer from developmental abnormalities owing to incomplete reprogramming. It has been observed that Oct4 was aberrantly expressed in cloned mouse blastocysts derived from cumulus donor nuclei [16, 17] . Besides, continuous expression of other somatic donor marker genes was demonstrated in some Xenopus NT embryos [18] . Some imprinted genes in donor cells were found to be aberrantly expressed in cloned embryos, presumably owing to the incomplete epigenetic reprogramming of the regulatory regions of imprinting loci [19] [20] [21] . Dysregulation of imprinted genes, such as Igf2, Igf2r, H19, and Xist, in cloned embryos can lead to both fetal and placental overgrowth and result in embryonic lethality or an abnormal growth condition called \"large offspring syndrome\", which is commonly found in cloned mammals [22] [23] [24] . Since the SCNT process does not increase the frequency of genetic alterations, it is suggested that the variable phenotypes observed in cloned embryos are associated with the reprogrammed epigenetic status of the donor nuclei [25] . This is supported by the findings that the developmental defects in cloned animals were not transmittable to the next offspring generation, indicating the presence of aberrant epigenetic reprogramming [26] . Aberrant DNA methylation patterns were indeed observed in NT embryos [27] . It was also demonstrated that the bovine NT blastocysts lack asymmetric patterns of both H3K9 methylation and acetylation between the inner cell mass and trophectoderm [28] , which may account for abnormal cloned embryo development.Although the rate of successful SCNT is very low, the reprogramming ability of factors in the egg/oocyte is highly efficient as the transplanted nuclei take less than 1 day to initiate cell division and trigger the \"normal\" developmental program. The donor cell epigenetic status has to be reprogrammed in order to support the embryonic program of development. In fact, genomewide demethylation was observed in the cloned blastocysts [29] . It has been shown that the Oct4 promoter of somatic cells undergoes DNA demethylation after nuclear transplantation into the germinal vesicle of Xenopus oocytes [30] . This demethylation of the Oct4 promoter was found to be mediated by Tet3 in a mouse SCNT study [31] , which is essential for the reactivation of Oct4 expression for successful SCNT. In addition, chromatin remodeling factors, such as ISWI and BRG1, are documented in facilitating the reprogramming of cell fate. It has been shown that ISWI, which is a chromatin remodeling ATPase, is able to dissociate TATA binding protein in somatic nuclei after incubation in the Xenopus egg extract, suggesting that ISWI-containing complexes are facilitating epigenetic reprogramming in an egg environment [32] . Besides, Xenopus egg extract depleted of BRG1 protein showed an abolishment of the reprogramming ability and hence failed to induce Oct4 expression in the somatic nuclei [33] . Therefore, chromatin structure remodeling is believed to be one of the reprogramming mechanisms. In addition, the maternalderived histone H3 variant H3.3 in the enucleated egg was found to replace the canonical histone H3 in the donor nuclei after SCNT, leading to the reactivation of key pluripotent genes that are originally associated with repressive histone marks [34] . Histone H2A variant, macroH2A, also plays an important role in the reactivation of female donor cell's inactive X chromosome during reprogramming. It was shown that knockdown of macroH2A facilitates X-reactivation and the expression of pluripotent genes in cloned Xenopus embryos [35] . More recently, it has been demonstrated that the H3K9 tri-methylation (H3K9me3) of the donor cell genome is a major epigenetic barrier to SCNT. Ectopic expression of H3K9 demethylases Kdm4b or Kdm4d in the mouse donor cells de-repressed the genomic regions that are resistant to reprogramming and thus significantly improving SCNT efficiency [36, 37] . Similarly, removal of H3K9me3 by ectopic expression of other H3K9 demethylases also demonstrated improved reprogramming efficiency in human and bovine SCNT experiments [38, 39] .Interestingly, it has been shown that the epigenetic state of a differentiated cell is directly correlated with its reprogrammability [40] . SCNT with ES cell nuclei demonstrated a much higher efficiency of generation of NT blastocysts than using other somatic cell types [41] . This could be associated with a more relaxed chromatin configuration in ES cells that may render their epigenome more susceptible for reprogramming [42] . Alternatively, it has been demonstrated that the cloning efficiency can be significantly improved by pre-treating the more differentiated and condensed chromatin state of somatic nuclei with epigenetic modifying agents, e.g. 5-aza-deoxycytidine and trichostatin A (TSA), that facilitate chromatin relaxation [43] [44] [45] . Interestingly, the effect of TSA treatment in improving SCNT is associated with the reactivation of a subset of genes that are repressed by H3K9me3 in the somatic cells [46] , presumably through introducing histone hyper-acetylation at their promoters. Altogether, SCNT provides a quick route of epigenetic reprogramming for a differentiated cell to a pluripotent state. Identification of the responsible reprogramming factors in the egg and oocyte cytoplasm will be one of the key future directions to improve the efficiency of SCNT and therapeutic cloning.", "citance": "Similarly, removal of H3K9me3 by ectopic expression of other H3K9 demethylases also demonstrated improved reprogramming efficiency in human and bovine SCNT experiments [38, 39] .Interestingly, it has been shown that the epigenetic state of a differentiated cell is directly correlated with its reprogrammability [40] .", "claims": [{"text": "High levels of H3K9me3 lead to increased reprogramming efficiency in bovine somatic cell nuclear transfer experiments.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Removal of H3K9me3 by ectopic expression of other H3K9 demethylases decreases reprogramming efficiency in SCNT experiments.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Removal of H3K9me3 by ectopic expression of other H3K9 demethylases improves reprogramming efficiency in SCNT experiments.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Removal of H3K9me3 improves reprogramming efficiency in bovine somatic cell nuclear transfer experiments.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Removal of H3K9me3 improves reprogramming efficiency in human somatic cell nuclear transfer experiments.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Removal of H3K9me3 lowers reprogramming efficiency in human somatic cell nuclear transfer experiments.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}

Previous studies have not investigated sex differences in this risk. This study was conducted to analyse associations between the use of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines and 2-year mortality in old people with dementia, and to investigate sex differences therein.   METHODS In total, 1037 participants (74% women; mean age, 89 years) with dementia were included from four cohort studies and followed for 2 years. Data were collected through home visits and medical records. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to analyse associations between ongoing baseline drug use and mortality. Multiple possible confounders were evaluated and adjusted for.   RESULTS In fully adjusted models including data from the whole population, no association between baseline psychotropic drug use and increased 2-year mortality was seen. Significant sex differences were found in mortality associated with antidepressant use, which was protective in men, but not in women (hazard ratio [HR] 0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.40-0.92 and HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.87-1.38, respectively). The interaction term for sex was significant in analyses of benzodiazepine use, with a higher mortality risk among men than among women.   CONCLUSIONS Among old people with dementia, ongoing psychotropic drug use at baseline was not associated with increased mortality in analyses adjusted for multiple confounders. Sex differences in mortality risk associated with antidepressant and benzodiazepine use were seen, highlighting the need for further investigation of the impact of sex.", "citation_paragraph": "The findings of this study with regard to antidepressants contrast with those of recent registry studies of old people [16, 26, 28, 35] , two of which specifically investigated people with dementia and all of which demonstrated increased mortality associated with antidepressant drug use. This difference could be explained in part by the baseline date, which was not set according to the prescription date, in the present study. Just as with antipsychotic use, higher initial mortality has been shown to be associated with antidepressant use [16] . Another explanatory factor could be the ability to adjust extensively for confounders in the present study, as the participants were recruited from studies in which they had been assessed thoroughly. Treatment with antidepressant drugs was Fig. 2 Unadjusted Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Notes: Green lines signify people with ongoing drug treatment at baseline, whereas blue lines signify non-users at baseline.

The analyses of antipsychotics and benzodiazepines include related drugs, as described in methods associated with better survival for men, but not for women. These results contrast with findings reported by Ryan et al. [29] , who observed an association between antidepressant use and increased mortality in old men. The characteristics of participants in the two studies, however, differ substantially, as Ryan et al. [29] did not examine people with dementia. Most antidepressant drugs have the potential to alter the conductive properties of the heart, giving rise to QT prolongation, an effect that is more pronounced in women than in men [48] . This effect can lead to potentially fatal arrhythmia (Torsade de Pointes) [49] . Other antidepressants (N06AX), including mirtazapine and venlafaxine, which were used more frequently by female participants in the current study, are among those associated most strongly with increased mortality in previous studies [16, 28] .

{"s2orc_id": 15141937, "title": "Mucosal Interactions between Genetics, Diet, and Microbiome in Inflammatory Bowel Disease", "abstract": "Numerous reviews have discussed gut microbiota composition changes during inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), particularly Crohn's disease (CD). However, most studies address the observed effects by focusing on studying the univariate connection between disease and dietary-induced alterations to gut microbiota composition. The possibility that these effects may reflect a number of other interconnected (i.e., pantropic) mechanisms, activated in parallel, particularly concerning various bacterial metabolites, is in the process of being elucidated. Progress seems, however, hampered by various difficult-to-study factors interacting at the mucosal level. Here, we highlight some of such factors that merit consideration, namely: (1) the contribution of host genetics and diet in altering gut microbiome, and in turn, the crosstalk among secondary metabolic pathways; (2) the interdependence between the amount of dietary fat, the fatty acid composition, the effects of timing and route of administration on gut microbiota community, and the impact of microbiota-derived fatty acids; (3) the effect of diet on bile acid composition, and the modulator role of bile acids on the gut microbiota; (4) the impact of endogenous and exogenous intestinal micronutrients and metabolites; and (5) the need to consider food associated toxins and chemicals, which can introduce confounding immune modulating elements (e.g., antioxidant and phytochemicals in oils and proteins). These concepts, which are not mutually exclusive, are herein illustrated paying special emphasis on physiologically inter-related processes.", "citation_paragraph": "Choline can be synthesized in small amounts by the liver, and is an important member of the B-vitamin-complex (495, 496) . Phosphatidylcholine is a type of phospholipid in lecithin, and structurally, phosphatidylcholine is comprised of a SFA, an unsaturated fatty acid, a glycerol, and a quaternary ammonium compound that comprises a choline group. Carnitine itself is a quaternary ammonium compound biosynthesized from the amino acids lysine and methionine, and the choline group within carnitine is structurally similar to that found in phosphatidylcholine (496) . Dietary sources of phosphatidylcholine and carnitine include animal-based foods such as red meat, eggs (yolk), milk and certain fish, which provide significant sources of choline in the body. In a metabolomics-based dietary intervention study, foods rich in phosphatidylcholine and carnitine resulted in the catabolism of choline via a microbiota-dependent mechanism to form: trimethylamine (TMA), and betaine (trimethyglyciene; TMG) (497), a molecule structurally similar to the amino acid glycine, but with three methyl groups (498) . In the liver, TMA is oxidized into trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) (499), a small molecule strongly associated with promoting inflammatorybased atherosclerosis (500, 501) . Most of the bacteria that express genes encoding for TMA lyases are found in three of the four major phyla of the human gut microbiome (502) . In apoliprotein E-deficient mice fed a diet with l-carnitine, the promotion of atherosclerosis was also mediated by a microbiota-dependent mechanism (501). While higher plasma levels of l-carnitine, in association with TMAO, are positively correlated with cardiovascular events in humans, intriguingly, omnivores produce more TMAO from dietary l-carnitine than vegans or vegetarians (501) . One plausible explanation for these observed differences can be in underlying archaeal lineages within the human gut microbiome. For instance, certain strains of methanogens, such as Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis and Methanosarcina barkeri strictly use methyl-based compounds, including TMA, as substrates for methanogenesis to enable their growth, which can deplete TMA levels (503) . M. luminyensis is a hydrogendependent organism and member of the novel archaeal group Methanomassiliicoccales, and like other methanogens, capable of using methanol for methanogenesis (504) . However, one remarkable feature of M.luminyensis is their ability to encode a rare proteinogenetic amino acid pyrrolysine (Pyl), a unique characteristic shared only by a limited number of other bacteria and some of the family Methanosarcinaceae (504). This is a truly distinguishing characteristic because methylotropic methanogenesis of methylated amines, such as TMA, monomethylamine, and dimethylamine can only occur in the presence of pyrrolysine in the active catalytic site (505) . Furthermore, studies exploring the abundance and activity of archaeal taxa have identified differences in organism groups between human populations based on geography and dietary habits (e.g., salt-fermented seafood) (504, (506) (507) (508) (509) (510) (511) .

Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and all-trans retinoic acid (RA) induce monocytic differentiation of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells in a synergistic manner. We used the promoter of DIF2, a gene involved in monocytic differentiation, to model the mechanism underlying the cooperative induction of target genes by RA and TNFalpha. We show a functional RA response element in the DIF2 promoter, which is constitutively bound by PML/RARalpha in APL cells. RA stimulates release of corepressors and recruitment of chromatin modifying proteins and additional transcription factors to the promoter, but these changes cause only a modest induction of DIF2 mRNA. Co-stimulation with RA plus TNFalpha facilitates binding of NF-kappaB to the promoter, which is crucial for full induction of transcription. Furthermore, RA plus TNFalpha greatly enhanced the level of RNA Pol II phosphorylation on the DIF2 promoter, via synergistic recruitment of TFIIH. We propose that RA mediates remodeling of chromatin to facilitate binding of transcription factors, which cooperate to enhance Pol II phosphorylation, providing a mechanism whereby nuclear receptors interact with other signaling pathways on the level of transcription.", "citation_paragraph": "Identification of an RAREs that may mediate enhancement of DIF2 expression by RA By northern blotting, we showed an early induction of DIF2 mRNA production after treatment of PML/RARa positive NB4 cells with either RA or TNFa. Induction by TNFa alone was significantly stronger than with RA alone, but co-treatment with both drugs was required for maximal induction. Quantitative RT-PCR verified that RA alone triggers a weak induction of DIF2 expression, but strongly potentiates its induction by TNFa ( Figure 1A ).To identify putative RAREs in the DIF2 gene that may mediate the effects of RA, we screened 5 kb upstream and downstream of the transcriptional start site for direct repeats (DR) of the half-site (A/G)G(G/T)TCA, using the net-based programs CONSITE and TRANSFAC \u00d5 TfBlast. The maximal deviation from the consensus sequence was restricted to one position. Upstream of the DIF2 start site, we identified a putative DR2 RARE at position \u00c0560 (named RARE1, Figure 1B ) having the sequence AGATCAcgAGGTCA. Two overlapping DR2 elements were also found downstream of the start site, at position +4912 (named RARE2). Of note, a putative NF-kB site was found close to RARE1, at position \u00c0140, while no NF-kB site was found in the vicinity of RARE2. By ChIP analysis using antibodies selective for RARa or PML, we showed that PML/RARa associates with RARE1 in vivo. The receptor was found to be constitutively bound to this site and the presence of ligand did not alter the association ( Figure 1C ). EMSA experiments also showed PML/ RARa binding to this sequence in vitro (data not shown). In contrast, no association of PML/RARa with RARE2 was detected, in the absence or presence of RA ( Figure 1C ). Using primers specific to an area 3 kb upstream of the DIF2 start site and primers to a region of chromosome six nonadjacent to the DIF2 gene, we confirmed specificity of the PML/RARa association with RARE1 ( Figure 1C ).RA recruits co-activators and chromatin modifying complexes to the DIF2 promoter region and induces changes associated with active transcriptionHaving established that DIF2 is cooperatively induced by RA and TNFa within 1 h, we deemed it to be a useful model system to investigate the mechanism whereby the two pathways integrate on a transcriptional level. Since PML/RARa was found constitutively bound to RARE1 in the DIF2 promoter, and RA induced some transcription, we first investigated the ability of RA to recruit different co-stimulatory molecules to this promoter region. RA stimulation has been demonstrated to recruit coactivators and chromatin modifying activity to RAR target genes within 2 h (16-18), and in agreement with this, we found that the corepressor SMRT dissociated from the DIF2 promoter and was replaced by co-activators CBP, TRAP220 (MED1) and ACTR (AIB1, p/CIP, SRC3) within 1 h of RA treatment (Figure 2A ). These changes further verified the presence of a functional RARE in the promoter. We did not find the histone methyltransferase CARM1 to be recruited to the promoter, nor was its target, arginine 17 of histone 3, methylated upon RA stimulation (data not shown). This is consistent with a previous report suggesting that CARM1 or ACTR are recruited to the oestrogen receptor in mutually exclusive complexes (19) .A previous study using in vitro reconstituted chromatin found an ordered recruitment of protein complexes to the RARa prior to transcriptional activation (20) . It was found that components of the SWI/SNF complex could also augment RAR-driven transcription when added to the reaction subsequent to complexes having acetyltransferase activity. Therefore, we looked at SWI/SNF association with the DIF2 promoter in response to RA, using antibodies toward the SNF5 catalytic subunit of the complex. The chromatin remodeler was seen complexed with the DIF2 promoter within 45 min of RA treatment and its binding was inversely correlated with the repressor HDAC1 ( Figure 2B ). Interestingly, SNF5 cycled on and off the DIF2 promoter in a manner similar to that previously reported for the BRG1 component of the same complex on the oestrogen-responsive pS2 promoter (19) . These data indicate that activation of PML/RARa results in cycling of corepressors and activator proteins, as has been observed with wild-type nuclear receptors (18, 21) . Of note, even though the DIF2 promoter displayed many aspects of a transcriptionally active gene upon RA treatment, only a modest increase in mRNA was observed in the absence of TNFa ( Figure 1A ), indicating that chromatin remodeling in response to RA is not enough to fully activate transcription of this gene.To further address this issue, we investigated the functionality of the co-activators recruited by RA. We found a functional HAT complex to be recruited by RA as evidenced by a marked increase in levels of histone acetylation surrounding RARE1 ( Figure 2C, left panel) . Histone acetylation was observed shortly after recruitment of the histone acetyltransferase CBP and concurrently with SNF5 recruitment to the DIF2 promoter ( Figure 2B and C), consistent with a previous report showing that SWI/SNF can augment RARa induction of transcription on chromatin templates when added subsequent to histone acetylation (20) . Studies in yeast have also indicated that recruitment of the SWI/SNF complex may require histone acetylation (22) . Of note, amplification with primers 3a, b and 4a, b detected no increase in histone acetylation around RARE2 or further upstream of the DIF2 start site (data not shown). We further assessed changes in histone lysine methylation after 45 min of RA treatment, when acetylation was seen to be increased. In contrast to reports showing an increase in H3 lysine 4 methylation upon RA stimulation (23), we observed a decrease in dimethylated H3 lysine 4 without an increase in trimethylated H3 lysine 4 ( Figure 2C , right panel, and data not shown). This is similar to what was seen in a xenopus oocyte system with the thyroid receptor (24) . A recent report also demonstrated that recruitment of histone demethylases and a transient decrease in histone methylation is required for ligand-dependent induction of transcription by nuclear receptors (25) .The above data demonstrate that RA activation of DIF2 in NB4 cells is associated with the induction of many hallmarks of a fully transcriptionally active promoter and are consistent with previous reports of nuclear receptor function on their target promoters. To determine if histone acetylation is sufficient for SNF5 recruitment and synergy with TNFa, we asked whether HDAC inhibition by TSA could recapitulate the effects of RA. TSA stimulation increased both histone 4 acetylation and SNF5 recruitment, as expected ( Figure 3A) . However, northern blotting showed that TSA did not significantly increase DIF2 mRNA levels when combined with either RA or TNFa, indicating that an increase in total acetylation on this promoter, such as is seen as a result of either RA or TSA action, cannot alone mediate synergy with TNFa ( Figure 3B ). Other HDAC inhibitors were also tested, with similar results (data not shown).RA facilitates recruitment of NF-iB by TNFa without altering nuclear translocation of p65/RelA Induction of transcription by TNFa is mediated by the transcription factor NF-kB (26) . In unstimulated cells, the NF-kB complex is sequestered in the cytoplasm by IkB proteins. Upon TNFa stimulation, IkB is rapidly phosphorylated by IkB kinase beta (IKKb) and subsequently degraded, thereby allowing release and activation of the NF-kB complex. Activated NF-kB translocates into the nucleus where it binds DNA and activates transcription (27) . TNFa-induced transcription is thus dependent on IKKb and can be inhibited by a selective inhibitor, such as compound A (14) . To test if the effect of RA on DIF2 transcription is also dependent on NF-kB/IKKb, we assessed induction of DIF2 expression by RA and/or TNFa in the absence or presence of compound A. As expected, the inhibitor completely blocked induction of DIF2 by TNFa. In contrast, it had no effect on RAinduced expression, but reduced the superinduced levels seen with RA plus TNFa to that seen with RA alone ( Figure 4A ). Thus, RA action on the DIF2 promoter appears to be independent of NF-kB, while augmenting the NF-kB-dependent activity of TNFa. Interestingly, a recent paper presented a detailed study of the HAS2 (hyaluronan synthase 2) promoter, which like the DIF2 promoter contains binding sites for both RARa and NF-kB, as well as SP1 (28) . Treatment with either RA or TNFa caused recruitment of co-activators to this promoter. In addition, both drugs increased HAS2 mRNA in an NF-kB-dependent manner, but co-treatment did not provide any additive effect (28) . This may suggest that the NF-kB independent activity of RA on the DIF2 promoter is crucial for its ability to cooperate with TNFa to induce transcription.We therefore investigated whether RA can stimulate binding of NF-kB transcription factors to the DIF2 promoter. We found that neither RA nor TNFa alone could stimulate a detectable increase in binding of the NFkB subunits p50 and p65 to the NF-kB site found at -140 ( Figure 1B) . However, RA plus TNFa caused a large increase in binding of both p50 and p65 to this site ( Figure 4B ), while no increased binding to another NF-kB site located at -3 kb was observed (data not shown). This increase could not be explained by enhanced nuclear shuttling of NF-kB, as levels of p65 in the nucleus were found to be equal in cells treated with TNFa alone versus RA plus TNFa ( Figure 4C ). The lack of an observable increase in NF-kB promoter binding induced by TNFa alone was surprising, as TNFa stimulation of NB4 cells does result in an accumulation of p65 in the nucleus, and also a significant increase in DIF2 mRNA. This failure to fully activate NF-kB binding is promoter dependent, since TNFa alone stimulates p65 binding to the IL-8 promoter in NB4 cells ( Figure 4D ).", "citance": "A recent report also demonstrated that recruitment of histone demethylases and a transient decrease in histone methylation is required for ligand-dependent induction of transcription by nuclear receptors (25) .The above data demonstrate that RA activation of DIF2 in NB4 cells is associated with the induction of many hallmarks of a fully transcriptionally active promoter and are consistent with previous reports of nuclear receptor function on their target promoters.", "claims": [{"text": "Histone demethylase recruitment and a transient decrease in histone methylation is necessary for ligand-dependent induction of transcription by nuclear receptors.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "RA activation of DIF2 and NB4 cells induces hallmarks of transcriptionally active promoters.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Ribosomes are the essential macromolecular machines that read the genetic code in all cells in all kingdoms of life. Following pre-assembly in the nucleus, precursors of the large 60S and small 40S ribosomal subunits are exported to the cytoplasm where the final steps in maturation are completed. Here, I review the recent insights into the conserved mechanisms of ribosome assembly that have come from functional characterisation of the genes mutated in human ribosomopathies. In particular, recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy, coupled with genetic, biochemical and prior structural data, have revealed that the SBDS protein that is deficient in the inherited leukaemia predisposition disorder Shwachman-Diamond syndrome couples the final step in cytoplasmic 60S ribosomal subunit maturation to a quality control assessment of the structural and functional integrity of the nascent particle. Thus, study of this fascinating disorder is providing remarkable insights into how the large ribosomal subunit is functionally activated in the cytoplasm to enter the actively translating pool of ribosomes.", "citation_paragraph": "The poorly understood mechanism of clonal progression to MDS/AML in SDS is encapsulated by Dameshek's riddle: how does attenuated translation and a hypoproliferative state (bone marrow failure) promote the transition to a hyperproliferative disorder (leukaemia) (Dameshek, 1967) ? Haematopoietic stem cells appear to be particularly sensitive to altered (either increased or decreased) levels of protein synthesis. For example, Pten deficiency in murine haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) promoted leukaemia partly by increasing protein synthesis (Signer et al., 2014) . However, the concept of \"niche-induced oncogenesis\" posits that the expression of pro-inflammatory factors by the bone marrow stroma may promote non cell-autonomous malignant transformation in HSPCs. Support for this concept is provided by the leukaemogenic effects of introducing activating Ptpn11 mutations into the stem cell microenvironment in mice (Dong et al., 2016) . Germline activating mutations of the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 (encoded by PTPN11) positively regulate Ras signalling in 50% of Noonan syndrome patients, who have an increased risk of developing juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML), a childhood myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). Remarkably, the introduction of Ptpn11 mutations into murine mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MPCs) and osteoprogenitors induced JMML-like MPN and donor-cell-derived MPN following stem cell transplantation as a consequence of excessive production of the pro-inflammatory chemokine CCL3 and the recruitment of monocytes that hyperactivate HSPCs by secreting interleukin 1b.Is such a mechanism relevant to SDS pathogenesis? Homozygous deletion of the murine Sbds gene from osterix-expressing mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells (MPCs) induced mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, increased generation of reactive oxygen species and activated the DNA damage response in HSPCs downstream of p53-S100A8/9-Toll like receptor inflammatory signalling (Zambetti et al., 2016) . However, no significant effects on bone marrow cellularity, function or HSPC number were identified, and leukaemia did not develop over the limited 4-week lifespan of the animals. Thus, further experiments are required to further validate the hypothesis that microenvironmental inflammation contributes to clonal selection and transformation in SDS. In particular, it will be important to analyse animals carrying disease-relevant hypomorphic Sbds mutations.HSPCs with impaired translation are likely under strong selective pressure for mutations that suppress the underlying growth defect and reverse the restraints on proliferation. The acquisition of sporadic biallelic TP53 mutations in SDS is clearly important clinically and biologically for clonal progression and transformation to MDS and is a poor prognostic indicator (Lindsley et al., 2017) . Interestingly, the recurrent del(20)q abnormality observed in the bone marrow of SDS patients is commonly associated with loss of the EIF6 gene (Pressato et al., 2012; Valli et al., 2013) . It is attractive to speculate that a reduced dose of eIF6 in SBDS-deficient HSPCs may help bypass the restraint on growth by ameliorating the defect in ribsosomal subunit joining, in turn favouring the formation of actively translating 80S ribosomes. It remains unclear whether the somatic acquisition of EIF6 gene deletions in SDS has prognostic significance.Heterozygous somatic mutations in the spliceosome gene U2AF1 occur in 11% of patients with MDS. Given the links between perturbed ribosome function and MDS (Barlow et al., 2010; Ebert et al., 2008; Finch et al., 2011; Pellagatti and Boultwood, 2017; Shirai et al., 2015) , it is intriguing that one consequence of transgenic expression of mutant U2AF1 in the mouse is dysregulation of genes involved in ribosome function and translation. These data suggest that impaired ribosome biogenesis and translation may functionally contribute to mutant U2AF1-associated disease, although this hypothesis needs to be further tested experimentally.", "citance": "Homozygous deletion of the murine Sbds gene from osterix-expressing mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells (MPCs) induced mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, increased generation of reactive oxygen species and activated the DNA damage response in HSPCs downstream of p53-S100A8/9-Toll like receptor inflammatory signalling (Zambetti et al., 2016) .", "claims": [{"text": "Homozygous deletion of murine Sbds gene from osterix-expressing mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells (MPCs) decreases the generation of reactive oxygen species.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Homozygous deletion of murine Sbds gene from osterix-expressing mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells (MPCs) induces increased generation of reactive oxygen species.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Homozygous deletion of murine Sbds gene from osterix-expressing mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells (MPCs) induces mitochondrial dysfunction.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Homozygous deletion of murine Sbds gene from osterix-expressing mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells (MPCs) induces oxidative stress.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Homozygous deletion of murine Sbds gene from osterix-expressing mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells (MPCs) prevents oxidative stress.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Homozygous deletion of murine Sbds gene from osterix-expressing mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells (MPCs) protects against mitochondrial dysfunction.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}

The negative direct or indirect contributions of various microorganisms in onset or severity of some neurodegeneration disorders and interaction between human immune system and pathogenic microorganisms has been portrayed in this review article.

{"s2orc_id": 3523746, "title": "Downloaded from", "abstract": "Although the study of imprinted genes in human development is very important, little is known about their expression and regulation in the early differentiation of human tissues due to lack of an appropriate model. In this study, a Chinese human embryonic stem (hES) cell line, SHhES1, was derived and fully characterized. Expression profiles of human imprinted genes were determined by Affymetrix Oligo micro-array in undifferentiated SHhES1 cells and SHhES1-derived embryoid bodies (EBs) at day 3, 8, 13 and 18. Thirty-two known human imprinted genes were detected in undifferentiated ES cells. Significantly, differential expression was found in nine genes at different stages of EB formation. Expression profile changes were confirmed by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in SHhES1 cells as well as in another independently derived hES cell line, HUES-7. In addition, the monoallelic expressions of four imprinted genes were examined in three different passages of undifferentiated ES cells and EBs of both hES cell lines. The monoallelic expressions of imprinted genes, H19, PEG10, NDNL1 and KCNQ1 were maintained in both undifferentiated hES cells and derived EBs. More importantly, with the availability of maternal peripheral blood lymphocyte sample, we demonstrated that the maternal expression of KCNQ1 and the paternal expression of NDNL1 and PEG10 were maintained in SHhES1 cells. These data provide the first demonstration that the parental-specific expression of imprinted genes is stable in EBs after extensive differentiation, also indicating that in vitro fertilization protocol does not disrupt the parental monoallelic expression of the imprinted genes examined.", "citation_paragraph": "Imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon that gives rise to differential expression of paternally and maternally inherited alleles of certain genes. It is established afresh in the germ line in each generation and stably inherited throughout somatic cell division (1) (2) (3) . Although imprinted genes comprise a small subset of the human genome, they have been shown to be essential to fetal, placental, and behavioral development (4) . Disruption of allele-specific expression of imprinted genes is associated with human genetic diseases, progression of certain cancers, and a number of neurological disorders (5) (6) (7) . Although imprinted genes play important roles in human early development, a comprehensive analysis of expression profiles of imprinted genes during early development has never been conducted in humans. Studies of imprinted genes in humans have been limited primarily to delineating the association of aberrant expression of a few imprinted genes with a number of diseases and cancers (1, 8) . Many questions regarding expression and regulation of imprinted genes in humans remain unanswered.Experimental evidence in mice has established links between in vitro embryo culture and the disrupted expression of imprinted genes (9) (10) (11) . However, a direct relationship between in vitroThe scarcity of human embryos available for research has severely hampered the study of imprinting regulation during the early stages of development. However, this problem can be circumvented to some extent by using human embryonic stem (hES) cell lines derived from the inner cell mass (ICM) of human pre-implantation embryos (14, 15) . ES cells are the in vitro counterparts of blastocyst ICM cells. Their in vitro differentiation to embryoid bodies (EBs) mimics events that occur in vivo shortly before and after embryonic implantation (16, 17) . It has been demonstrated that human EBs comprise the cells of the three embryonic germ layers, and express embryonic-specific genes in a stage-specific manner (18, 19) . Importantly, ES cells are derived from pre-implantation embryos at a time when gametic methylation imprints must be retained, and while most of the remainder of the genome is being stripped of its methylation (3) .Therefore, analysis of mRNA levels and parental-specific expression of imprinted genes during in vitro differentiation of hES cells could provide clues vis-\u00e1-vis the post-fertilization epigenetic events necessary for the establishment and maintenance of monoallelic expression during very early stages of development, for which, to date, there is no information. Furthermore, hES cell lines derived from surplus human blastocysts from clinical in vitro fertilization (IVF) could provide a cell model to evaluate the effects of (i) manipulation of embryos, (ii) cryopreservation, and/or (iii) different culture media on imprinting gene expression. More importantly, hES cells are able to self-renew indefinitely in vitro and have the capacity to give rise to differentiated progeny representative of all three embryonic germ layers (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) . Thus, these cells represent a potentially, unlimited resource for cell replacement therapies in the treatment of human diseases. Recently, as a step towards using hES cells in treatment of human diseases, patient-specific hES cell lines have been successfully established (25) . For transplantation purposes, it is very important to monitor and maintain genetic and epigenetic stability in hES, especially after long periods of culture and differentiation. Studies in mouse ES cells show that stem cell-derived tissues and embryos cloned from ES cell nuclei often fail to maintain the epigenetic states of imprinted genes (26) (27) (28) . The presence of cytogenetic abnormalities within hES cell culture has been reported in several labs (3, 24, 29, 30) . However, much less is known about the expression profile and epigenetic status of imprinted genes in hES cell lines following extended culture and upon differentiation.The aim of this study was to analyze temporal and parental specific expression profiles of imprinted genes in hES cells in their development into human EBs. To this end, a novel Chinese hES cell line, SHhES1, was derived and a large-scale transcription analysis of imprinted genes in hES cells at different stages during their differentiation in vitro was carried out by Affymetrix Oligo micro-array GeneChip, as an initial step towards (i) understanding the regulation of imprinted gene expression in human early development and (ii) estimating the risks of imprinting alteration after ART. We examined the monoallelic expressions of four imprinted genes in SHhES1 cells, and of two imprinted genes in another independently derived hES cell line, HUES-7 (31), at different passages in the undifferentiated state and after extensive differentiation.

Several reports in the literature support the observation that endothelization of stents placed over ulcerated plaques is sometimes incomplete with the attendant risk of thrombosis [1, 8] . Warfarin therapy immediately after stent placement may prevent the build-up of a thin thrombus layer over an atheromatous lesion-the first step to neointima formation-thus allowing later thrombus formation and embolization [11] .

Then in 2012, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS\u2010CoV) emerged from the Arabian Peninsula giving a still on\u2010going epidemic associated to a high fatality rate.

MERSCoV infection resulted in more than 1728 confirmed infected patients till April 2016 with a fatality rate of 36% (de Wit et al., 2016) .CoVs are enveloped viruses possessing a single stranded positive sense RNA genome of approximately 29.7 kb in length (Pan et al., 2008; Van Boheemen et al., 2012) . The SARS-CoV initiates its replication cycle after binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Kuhn et al., 2004) . After endocytosis, the viral RNA genome is released into the cellular host cytoplasm and translated into two large polyproteins (de Wit et al., 2016; Snijder et al., 2016) . The pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins are next cleaved by viral proteases into 11 and 16 non-structural proteins respectively (nsp1 to 16). These proteins form a large replication transcription complex (RTC) which is associated to host cellular proteins (Van Hemert et al., 2008) . CoV RTC ensures the replication of the viral genome and the transcription of genomic and subgenomic mRNA. These viral RNAs are polyadenylated at their 3 0 end and protected by a 5 0 cap structure, which is synthetized by viral enzymes. The CoV capping pathway is thought to follow four sequential steps implicating several nsps: I) the 5 0 -3 0 helicase/ NTPase nsp13 hydrolyses first the phosphate g from the nascent 5'-triphosphorylated RNA (Ivanov and Ziebuhr, 2004) ; II) a GMP molecule is supposedly transferred to the diphosphorylated RNA by a still unknown guanylyltransferase forming a cap (GpppN) structure; III) the cap is then methylated at N7 position of the guanosine by nsp14 in the presence of methyl donor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) yielding to a cap-0 ( 7m GpppN) and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH) by-product (Chen et al., 2009) ; IV) nsp10/nsp16 complex methylates at the ribose 2 0 OH group of the first transcribed RNA leading to the conversion of the cap-0 ( 7m GpppN) into the cap-1 ( 7m GpppN 2'om ) (Bouvet et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2011) . In vitro assays have deciphered the mechanisms driving the RNA cap methylation in SARS-and MERS-CoV. It follows an obligatory order in which N7-methylation by nsp14 is a pre-requisite for 2 0 Omethylation by the nsp10/nsp16 complex (Aouadi et al., 2017; Bouvet et al., 2014 Bouvet et al., , 2010 .The guanine N7-MTase activity embedded in the C-terminal domain of SARS-nsp14 has been discovered by yeast transcomplementation assay (Chen et al., 2009 ). In addition, the N-terminus moiety of nsp14 contains a DEDDh exonuclease (ExoN) domain (Minskaia et al., 2006) . The two domains communicate functionally, as truncation experiments showed that the N-terminal region of nsp14 is required for the N7-MTase activity (Chen et al., 2009 ). Both N7-MTase and ExoN activities have been confirmed by in vitro assay showing that the association of nsp10 to nsp14 stimulated >35 fold the ExoN activity while the N7-MTase activity does not depend on the nsp10-nsp14 interaction (Bouvet et al., 2012 (Bouvet et al., , 2010 Decroly et al., 2011) .The N7-and 2 0 O-methylations of the viral mRNA cap are key events for the viral infection. Indeed reverse genetic experiments revealed first that the N7-methylation of cap structures is essential for the synthesis of viral proteins (Case et al., 2016) . This observation is corroborated by former biochemical data showing that the N7-methyl guanosine of cap structures is recognized by the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and participates in the initiation of viral mRNA translation into proteins (Case et al., 2016; Cougot et al., 2004) . Accordingly, inhibitors blocking nsp14 N7-MTase activity have been identified by yeast based screening assay on SARS-CoV, and induced a potent antiviral effect demonstrating that nsp14 MTase activity is an attractive antiviral target (Sun et al., 2014) . Whereas N7-MTase mutants are replication defective, 2 0 O-MTase mutants show limited effect on virus replication in cell culture but have an attenuated phenotype in animal models Menachery et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2014; Z\u00fcst et al., 2013) . The molecular basis of this attenuated phenotype was recently elucidated: incompletely-capped RNAs have been shown to be recognized by immune sensors such as RIG-I and MDA-5, which trigger innate immunity pathways Schuberth-Wagner et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2013) . In turn, RIG-I or MDA-5 induces signalling cascades yielding to the expression of cytokines and type I interferon inducing an antiviral state in neighboring cells. Among the interferon-stimulated gens (ISG), IFIT1 also participates to the restriction of viral replication by sequestrating mis-capped viral RNAs (Pichlmair et al., 2011) . Thus cap structure is now considered as a kind of \"marker of self\" and it is currently admitted that 2 0 O-MTase inhibitors might help virus clearance by stimulation of the immune response Ferron et al., 2012; Z\u00fcst et al., 2011) .In this work we first developed an HTRF MTase assay in order to identify compounds inhibiting the N7-MTase activity of SARS-CoV nsp14. Using this system, we screened a library composed of 2000 compounds containing 1280 FDA approved molecules (Prestwick Chemical Library \u00ae ), 320 natural products and 400 pyridazine-derived compounds. The inhibitory effect of the 20 best compounds was confirmed by a radioactive filter-binding assay, and refined by IC 50 values determination on SARS nsp14 and human RNA N7-MTase (hRNMT). In addition, the specificity of each compound was further evaluated using the CoV 2 0 O-MTase (nsp10/ nsp16) and the MTases of Dengue and West-Nile flaviviruses as well as the hRNMT involved in the capping of cellular RNAs.", "citance": "Among the interferon-stimulated gens (ISG), IFIT1 also participates to the restriction of viral replication by sequestrating mis-capped viral RNAs (Pichlmair et al., 2011) .", "claims": [{"text": "IFIT1 restricts viral replication by sequestrating mis-capped viral RNAs.", "subject": "IFIT1 ", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "IFIT1 speeds viral replication by allowing for the proliferation of mis-capped viral RNAs.", "subject": "IFIT1 ", "is_negation": true}]}
{"s2orc_id": 27675670, "title": "Activation of non-canonical WNT signaling in human visceral adipose tissue contributes to local and systemic inflammation", "abstract": "The accumulation of visceral adiposity is strongly associated with systemic inflammation and increased cardiometabolic risk. WNT5A, a non-canonical WNT ligand, has been shown to promote adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance in animal studies. Among other non-canonical pathways, WNT5A activates planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling. The current study investigated the potential contribution of non-canonical WNT5A/PCP signaling to visceral adipose tissue (VAT) inflammation and associated metabolic dysfunction in individuals with obesity. VAT and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) samples obtained from subjects undergoing bariatric surgery were analyzed by qRT-PCR for expression of WNT/PCP genes. In vitro experiments were conducted with preadipocytes isolated from VAT and SAT biopsies. The expression of 23 out of 33 PCP genes was enriched in VAT compared to SAT. Strong positive expression correlations of individual PCP genes were observed in VAT. WNT5A expression in VAT, but not in SAT, correlated with indexes of JNK signaling activity, IL6, waist-to-hip ratio and hsCRP. In vitro, WNT5A promoted the expression of IL6 in human preadipocytes. In conclusion, elevated non-canonical WNT5A signaling in VAT contributes to the exacerbated IL-6 production in this depot and the low-grade systemic inflammation typically associated with visceral adiposity.", "citation_paragraph": "The differential expression of developmental genes has been suggested to contribute to the qualitative differences between visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue and to the different cardiometabolic risk associated with the expansion of these depots in the context of obesity [9] [10] [11] . In this study we analyzed gene expression patterns in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue to gain insight into the potential role of non-canonical WNT5A/PCP signaling in adipose tissue inflammation in the setting of obesity. Our data show an over-activation of this signaling pathway in VAT under obesity conditions, which may contribute to the exacerbated local and systemic inflammation associated with visceral adiposity and its metabolic and cardiovascular complications.We and others have previously reported that WNT5A is expressed at higher levels in VAT than SAT in the setting of obesity 14, 23 , a finding that we corroborated in the current study. However, the expression of the many signaling genes that modulate WNT5A-mediated PCP signaling had remained largely unexplored. In this regard, our study adds insight into the role of non-canonical WNT signaling in adipose tissue heterogeneity by demonstrating that most of the downstream components of the non-canonical WNT/PCP signaling pathway (70% of the analyzed genes) are markedly overrepresented in VAT compared to SAT. These data suggest that the over-activation of this signaling pathway extends beyond the increased expression of the WNT5A ligand in this depot. It is noteworthy that many of the WNT/PCP receptor components that we found most highly upregulated in VAT (ROR2 ~33-fold; PTK7, ~9-fold; VANGL2, ~4-fold; PRICKLE1, ~3-fold) have been shown to be essential for WNT5A signaling in different experimental settings 24, 27, 33 . We are unaware of any other signaling pathway that has been reported to be so uniformly and robustly upregulated in visceral fat. These findings suggest that PCP signaling modulators represent unique nodal drivers of VAT dysfunction in the setting of obesity.Our data also reveals a remarkable correlation among the expression of different PCP genes in VAT, particularly in subjects with diabetes, suggesting the existence of common regulatory mechanisms that coordinate their expression. The regulators of PCP gene expression in omental fat are probably multiple. Omental and subcutaneous fat have different embryological origins, and this could contribute to the differential expression of WNT/ PCP genes. In this regard, the greater expression of WNT5A observed in omental versus subcutaneous preadipocytes is consistent with this possibility. Several developmental genes have been reported to be differentially expressed in the different adipose tissue depots [9] [10] [11] 34 , although not to the extent that is observed for some WNT/ PCP genes. On the other hand, we have previously reported that myeloid cells are a significant source of Wnt5a in mouse adipose tissue 14 , and pro-inflammatory TLR signaling has been reported to increase WNT5A expression in human monocyte/macrophages 35 . Thus, the differential expression of WNT5A in VAT and SAT could also reflect differences in macrophage infiltration and/or activation. Regardless of the underlying mechanism, these data suggest that not only VAT does produce more WNT5A, but also that this fat depot is likely to be more responsive to its actions, given its higher expression of WNT/PCP receptors and other WNT signaling intermediates. Consistent with this notion, we find that WNT5A is associated with increased JNK signaling in VAT, but not in SAT. Although WNT5A is able to activate a plethora of signaling pathways in a context-dependent manner, JNK is the main signaling kinase activated by the WNT/PCP pathway in mammals 15, 16 , and it frequently mediates the effects of WNT5A. Notably, experimental studies suggest that JNK signaling is particularly relevant in the setting of obesity-induced inflammation and associated metabolic dysfunction 28, 29 . Systemic low-grade inflammation is one of the main mechanisms that link obesity with insulin resistance, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. While conflicting data have been reported on the contribution of subcutaneous fat, a consistent body of evidence suggests a strong association between the accumulation of intra-abdominal visceral fat and systemic inflammation 36 . The pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 is generally believed to be a particularly relevant contributor to the high cardiometabolic risk associated with intra-abdominal fat accumulation. It is produced at higher levels in VAT compared to SAT 3, 6, 7 and circulating IL-6 levels exhibit a stronger association with visceral adiposity than other pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF 4, 31 . Despite of these findings, the specific mechanisms that account for the increased production of IL-6 in VAT remain poorly defined. In this regard, we recently reported that Wnt5a promotes adipose tissue inflammation and systemic insulin resistance in mouse models of obesity, at least in part through an increased production of IL-6 in adipose tissue 14 . However, the extrapolation of these mouse results to human obesity remained challenging due to the many differences between adipose tissue depots in mice and humans 37 . While omental fat is the prototypical visceral fat depot in humans, this depot is essentially absent in mice. Furthermore, inflammatory responses in mice and humans are known to differ significantly 38 , and the biology of IL-6 is likely to exhibit many differences between species, as suggested by the low amino acid sequence identity between human and mouse IL-6 proteins (~41%) 39 . The results of the current studies with subcutaneous and omental preadipocytes in culture and the in vivo association between the expression of WNT5A and IL6 in VAT presented herein supports our previous mouse studies 14 , and provides evidence that WNT5A/PCP signaling is a clinically-relevant contributor to the elevated IL-6 production in VAT. The correlation observed in VAT between WNT5A and the pJNK/JNK ratio, an index of JNK signaling, also supports this possibility. JNK signaling is known to promote IL-6 expression in adipose tissue 29 , and our previous mouse studies suggest that JNK signaling is a main mechanism linking WNT5A to IL-6 production 13, 14 . Further supporting this WNT5A/IL-6 connection, we also observed a significant association between WNT5A expression in VAT and circulating levels of CRP, a marker of systemic inflammation. The connection between WNT5A expression in VAT and IL-6/CRP levels is of particular relevance, given the large body of clinical evidence that links increased IL-6 signaling and/or increased circulating CRP levels to insulin resistance, diabetes and atherosclerotic CVD 4, [40] [41] [42] [43] . Some of our data suggest that the contribution of non-canonical WNT5A signaling to IL-6 production and inflammation may be particularly relevant in subjects with diabetes, which typically exhibit high levels of systemic inflammation. However, the differences between subjects with and without diabetes observed in our study need to be interpreted with caution, given our limited sample size and the substantial differences in clinical characteristics between subjects with and without diabetes. Future studies with greater sample size will be needed to assess whether a direct connection between diabetes and WNT5A expression in VAT exists in humans, as suggested by our previous mouse studies 14 . Our study is limited by its cross-sectional nature and the specific characteristics of the studied patient population, which included mostly patients with BMI \u2265 35 kg/m 2 . The analysis of such population may preclude the detection of pathophysiologically relevant associations that might be clearer in more diverse populations. Another limitation of our study is that most patients were on treatment with a number of drugs, including thiazolidinediones, anti-inflammatory drugs and statins, which may have confounded our results. Indeed, the association between WNT5A expression in VAT and circulating CRP levels only reached statistical significance after exclusion of subjects on anti-inflammatory drugs. Similarly, we cannot discard that the low calorie diet and associated body weight loss that is required prior to bariatric surgery may have affected gene expression or systemic inflammation in the subjects included in our study. Overall, these limitations highlight the need for more extensive studies that include the analysis of PCP gene expression in VAT and/or SAT of individuals across different BMI groups and before and after bariatric surgery. Future studies are also warranted to evaluate the potential association between WNT5A/PCP signaling in adipose tissue and atherosclerotic CVD, given the major role that IL-6 signaling plays in this condition as revealed by large Mendelian randomization studies 44, 45 . In summary, the present study reveals a remarkable overactivation of non-canonical WNT5A/PCP signaling in visceral fat under obesity conditions, which contributes to the higher IL-6 production and systemic inflammation typically associated with visceral adiposity, in particular in individuals with diabetes. Future studies are warranted to evaluate the mechanisms underlying PCP signaling activation in visceral adipose tissue and the therapeutic or prognostic potential of this pathway in the setting of obesity and associated cardiometabolic disease.", "citance": "Future studies are also warranted to evaluate the potential association between WNT5A/PCP signaling in adipose tissue and atherosclerotic CVD, given the major role that IL-6 signaling plays in this condition as revealed by large Mendelian randomization studies 44, 45 .", "claims": [{"text": "IL-6 signaling plays a major role in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-22 and -29 and pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-18 (IL18) are present in human hearts. IL18 may regulate MMP-22 and -29 expression, which may correlate with CHD progression. Immunoblot analysis showed that IL18 induced MMP-22 expression in human aortic smooth muscle cells. The Mann Whitney test from a prospective study of 194 CHD patients and 68 non-CHD controls demonstrated higher plasma levels of IL18, MMP-22 and -29 in CHD patients than in the controls. A logistic regression test suggested that plasma IL18 (odds ratio (OR)=1.131, P=0.007), MMP-22 (OR=1.213, P=0.040), and MMP-29 (OR=1.198, P=0.033) were independent risk factors of CHD. Pearson\u2019s correlation test showed that IL18 (coefficient (r)=0.214, P=0.045; r=0.246, P=0.031) and MMP-22 (r=0.273, P=0.006; r=0.286, P=0.012) were associated with the Gensini score before and after adjusting for potential confounding factors. The multivariate Pearson\u2019s correlation test showed that plasma MMP-22 levels correlated positively with high-sensitive-C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (r=0.167, P=0.023), and MMP-29 levels correlated negatively with triglyceride (r=\u22120.169, P=0.018). Spearman\u2019s correlation test indicated that plasma IL18 levels associated positively with plasma MMP-22 (r=0.845, P<0.001) and MMP-29 (r=0.548, P<0.001). Our observations suggest that IL18, MMP-22 and -29 serve as biomarkers and independent risk factors of CHD. Increased systemic IL18 in CHD patients may contribute to elevated plasma MMP-22 and -29 levels in these patients. \u63a2\u8ba8\u51a0\u5fc3\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u8840\u6d46\u767d\u7ec6\u80de\u4ecb\u7d2018(IL18)\u6c34\u5e73\u662f\u5426\u4e0e\u57fa\u8d28\u91d1\u5c5e\u86cb\u767d\u9176-22 \u548c-29(MMP-22 \u548cMMP-29)\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u6c34\u5e73\u76f8\u5173, \u4ee5\u53ca\u6b64\u7c7b\u60a3\u8005\u8840\u6d46\u4e2dMMP-22 \u53caMMP-29 \u6c34\u5e73\u662f\u5426\u5347\u9ad8\u3002 \u9996\u6b21\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5728\u52a8\u8109\u7ca5\u6837\u786c\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u708e\u75c7\u53cd\u5e94\u53ef\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdbMMP-22 \u53caMMP-29 \u7684\u8868\u8fbe, IL18 \u662f\u51a0\u5fc3\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u4e2d\u8c03\u63a7MMP \u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u708e\u75c7\u56e0\u5b50\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002 \u901a\u8fc7\u514d\u75ab\u5370\u8ff9\u5206\u6790\u68c0\u6d4bIL18 \u5bf9\u4eba\u4f53\u52a8\u8109\u5e73\u6ed1\u808c\u7ec6\u80deMMP-22 \u7684\u8868\u8fbe; \u901a\u8fc7Mann Whitney \u68c0\u9a8c\u5bf9\u6765\u81ea\u4e8e194 \u4f8b\u51a0\u5fc3\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u548c68 \u4f8b\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u7684\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790; \u901a\u8fc7logistic \u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\u51a0\u5fc3\u75c5\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20; \u901a\u8fc7Pearson \u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790IL18 \u548cMMP-22 \u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0e\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109Gensini \u79ef\u5206\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027; \u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u53d8\u91cfPearson \u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8840\u6d46MMP-22 \u6c34\u5e73\u4e0e\u8d85\u654fC \u53cd\u5e94\u86cb\u767d(hs-CRP)\u53ca\u7518\u6cb9\u4e09\u916f\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027; \u901a\u8fc7Spearman \u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8840\u6d46IL18 \u6c34\u5e73\u4e0eMMP-22 \u548cMMP-29 \u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002 \u51a0\u5fc3\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u8840\u6d46IL18 \u6c34\u5e73\u5347\u9ad8\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b64\u7c7b\u60a3\u8005\u8840\u6d46MMP-22\u548cMMP-29\u6c34\u5e73\u5347\u9ad8\u3002IL18\u3001MMP-22\u548cMMP-29 \u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u51a0\u5fc3\u75c5\u7684\u751f\u7269\u6807\u8bb0\u7269\u548c\u72ec\u7acb\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "citation_paragraph": "Coronary heart disease (CHD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide (Pagidipati and Gaziano, 2013) . Recent studies have underscored the importance of detecting, monitoring, and controlling the vulnerability of atherosclerotic plaques to reduce the mortality rate among CHD patients (Cheng et al., 2006; Libby et al., 2009; Finn et al., 2010; Arbab-Zadeh and Fuster, 2015) . Inflammatory cell accumulation and production of inflammatory cytokines are key processes that contribute to the initiation, progression, and ultimately the rupture and thrombosis of atherosclerotic plaques (Ross, 1999; Hansson, 2005; Libby et al., 2009) . Arterial wall extracellular matrix (ECM) protein degradation is one of the most prominent mechanisms of aortic atherosclerotic lesion growth and rupture, in which matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are among the common proteases (Herman et al., 2001; Katsuda and Kaji, 2003; Newby, 2005; Siasos et al., 2012) .Previous studies showed significantly elevated plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-18 (IL18) in patients who developed coronary events. Plasma IL18 has been considered as an inflammatory risk factor of human CHD (Blankenberg et al., 2002; Evans et al., 2007; Jefferis et al., 2011; . In addition to its systemic increases, IL18 expression was also found increased in human and experimental atherosclerotic lesions (Mallat et al., 2001; Gerdes et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2015) . In mouse experimental models, deficiency of IL18 or IL18 receptors protected mice from diet-induced atherosclerosis (Elhage et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2015) . Intraperitoneal administration of recombinant IL18 accelerated atherogenesis in mice (Tenger et al., 2005) . Our recent study suggested that IL18 contributes to atherogenesis by inducing inflammatory cell (e.g. macrophages and T cells) production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as IL6, interferon-\uf067 (IFN-\uf067), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) (Wang et al., 2015) . IL18 is also a known inducer of MMP expression from inflammatory cells, such as natural killer (NK) cell (Ishida et al., 2004) , monocytes and macrophages (Quiding-Jarbrink et al., 2001; Abraham et al., 2002; Gerdes et al., 2002) , and cardiomyocytes (Reddy et al., 2010) .MMPs are highly expressed in various pathological processes, such as inflammation, myocardial injury, and vascular aneurysms and remodeling (Creemers et al., 2001) . Several major MMPs, such as MMP-1, -2, -7, -9, and -12 have been shown to be increased in the plasma or atherosclerotic lesions from CHD patients (Loftus et al., 2001; Nilsson et al., 2006; Lehrke et al., 2009; Ma et al., 2014; Goncalves et al., 2015) . Genetic depletion or pharmacological inhibition of these MMPs protected mice from experimental atherosclerosis (Luttun et al., 2004; Kuzuya et al., 2006; Johnson et al., 2011; Hu et al., 2015) . Human MMP-22 was first identified from human testis and heart. Northern blot detection showed its dominant expression in the human heart (Gururajan et al., 1998) . Alternative splicing yielded three MMP-22 isoforms that differ in length of exon 4 or 5 (Gururajan et al., 1998) . However, there is no further study to report its function or expression regulation in any tissue, cell type, or pathological condition. Human MMP-29 was also initially isolated from a human testis complementary DNA (cDNA) library, but it is more broadly expressed than MMP-22. Small intestine, liver, heart, kidney, and many other organs express this MMP (Wu et al., 2007) . In addition to these initial expression profiles, there is no study to test the role of MMP-29 in the heart or vascular system. As atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the aortic artery and inflammation may induce the expression of these underestimated MMP members (Mallat et al., 2001; Blankenberg et al., 2002; Gerdes et al., 2002; Evans et al., 2007; Jefferis et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2015) , we designed this study to test whether increased plasma and arterial wall inflammatory cytokine IL18 in CHD patient was correlated with or affected the expression of MMP-22 and -29, and whether plasma levels of these MMPs were also increased in CHD patients.", "citance": "Our recent study suggested that IL18 contributes to atherogenesis by inducing inflammatory cell (e.g. macrophages and T cells) production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as IL6, interferon-\uf067 (IFN-\uf067), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) (Wang et al., 2015) .", "claims": [{"text": "IL18 contributes to atherogenesis by inducing inflammatory cell production of inflammatory chemokines.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "IL18 contributes to atherogenesis by inducing inflammatory cell production of inflammatory cytokines.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "IL18 contributes to atherogenesis by suppressing inflammatory cell production of inflammatory chemokines.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}

Macrophages play a central role in host defense against invading pathogens. In this study, we discovered an interesting phenomenon: ALV-J replication is weakened from 3 hours post-infection (hpi) to 36 hpi, which was verified using Western blotting and RT-PCR. To further investigate the interaction between ALV-J and macrophages, transcriptome analysis was performed to analyze the host genes' function in chicken primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). Compared to the uninfected control, 624 up-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEG) and 341 down-regulated DEG at 3 hpi, and 174 up-regulated DEG and 87 down-regulated DEG at 36 hpi were identified in chicken MDM, respectively. ALV-J infection induced strong innate immune responses in chicken MDM at 3 hpi, instead of 36 hpi, according to the analysis results of Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway. Importantly, the host factors, such as up-regulated MIP-3\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, iNOS, K60, IRG1, CH25H, NFKBIZ, lysozyme and OASL were involved in the host defense response during the course of ALV-J infection. On the contrary, up-regulated EX-FABP, IL4I1, COX-2, NFKBIA, TNFAIP3 and the Jak STAT pathway inhibitors including CISH, SOCS1 and SOCS3 are beneficial to ALV-J survival in chicken macrophages. We speculated that ALV-J tropism for macrophages helps to establish a latent infection in chicken MDM from 6 to 36 hpi. The present study provides a comprehensive view of the interactions between macrophages and ALV-J. It suggests the mechanisms of defense of chicken macrophages against ALV-J invasion and how ALV-J escape the host innate immune responses.", "citation_paragraph": "As an avian retrovirus, ALV-J has been studied for many years although many interesting scientific problems such as tumorigenesis, immunosuppression and immune responses induced by ALV-J infection are still not understood [1] . In our previous studies, we found that chicken MDM are susceptible to ALV-J infection [10] . In the present study, we observed that ALV-J replication in MDM was active at 3 hpi, but inhibited from 6 to 36 hpi. It is reported that recombinant chicken IFN-\u03b1 as well as the ISG, CCCH type zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP), could inhibit ALV-J replication in DF1 cells [24, 25] . So, we speculated that ISG may also resist ALV-J replication in chicken MDM.ALV-J infection induced most immune-related DEG in MDM at 3 hpi (Tables 1 and 2 ). Strikingly, the expression of 79 ISG including CH25H, PKR, OASL, Mx, and etc. were significantly increased in ALV-J-infected MDM at 3 hpi. ISG exert numerous antiviral effector functions by targeting almost any step in the virus life cycle [26] . For example, CH25H broadly inhibited growth of enveloped viruses including VSV, HSV, HIV and the acutely pathogenic viruses EBOV, RVFV and RSSEV by converting cholesterol to 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC) [27] . Additionally, 18 up-regulated ISG were identified in ALV-J MDM at 36 hpi. All of these up-regulated ISG in ALV-J-infected MDM at 3 and 36 hpi might serve as candidates resisting ALV-J infection. In addition to the above ISG, some DEG have significant changes in expression at 3 hpi and 36 hpi (Table 2) . MIP-3\u03b1, macrophage inflammatory protein-3 alpha, is responsible for the chemo-attraction of dendritic cells, and effector and memory B and T cells [28] . Moreover, MIP-3\u03b1 exhibited anti-microbial and anti-HIV activities [28] [29] [30] . IL-1\u03b2 is produced primarily by activated macrophages and possess multiple and diverse properties in their response to infection [31, 32] . Thus, host damage following infection induces macrophage secretion of a variety of inflammatory mediators including IL-1 and NO that activate anti-pathogenic microorganism defense mechanisms [2] . NO production is primarily catalyzed by iNOS and is a part of innate host defenses [33] . ALV-J infection in MDM at 3 hpi increased expression of the two orthologues of chicken IL-8, K60 (IL8L1) and IL8 (IL8L2) [34, 35] . IL-8 is a potent chemo-attractant and activator of macrophages [36] . Furthermore, IL-8 has been shown to attract and activate T lymphocytes [37, 38] , which would aid in raising an immunologically specific response against ALV-J. Immune response gene 1 (IRG1) was originally identified as a highly inducible gene in murine macrophages following LPS stimulation [39] . The role of IRG1 in the course of virus infection has not been extensively reported. IRG1 was identified as an ISG with antiviral effects against different neurotropic viruses [40] . OASL has been found to broadly inhibit the replication of viruses such as swine fever virus, RSV and HCV through a variety of mechanisms [41] [42] [43] . Lysozyme is a differentiation marker for macrophage, and is activated during macrophage differentiation [44] . We found that lysozyme expression increased incrementally from 3 hpi to 36 hpi in ALV-J-infected MDM. This result reminded us that ALV-J infection could stimulate chicken macrophage maturation. Lysozyme is a cornerstone of innate immunity due to its direct antimicrobial activity through peptidoglycan hydrolysis and immune regulatory functions [45] . Interestingly, lysozyme also possesses antiviral properties [46, 47] . NFKBIZ encodes the protein I\u03baBz and is known as a partner of NF\u03baB that regulates innate host defense factors [48] . Accordingly, the host genes MIP-3\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, iNOS, K60, IRG1, CH25H, OASL, lysozyme and NFKBIZ served as restriction factor candidates against ALV-J infection in chicken macrophages. We further selected several of the anti-ALV-J candidates for verification. Exactly, the experiments in vitro show that overexpression of K60, IRG1, CH25H, and OASL could significantly decrease ALV-J replication in MDM at 3 hpi (Figure 7) .", "citance": "IRG1 was identified as an ISG with antiviral effects against different neurotropic viruses [40] .", "claims": [{"text": "IRG1 has antiviral effects against neurotropic viruses.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Distinct from other neurotransmitter receptors, the extracellular domains of iGluRs are loosely packed assemblies with two clearly distinct layers, each of which has both local and global 2-fold axes of symmetry. By contrast, the iGluR transmembrane segments have 4-fold symmetry and share a conserved pore loop architecture found in tetrameric voltage-gated ion channels. The striking layered architecture of iGluRs revealed by the 3.6 \u00c5 resolution structure of an AMPA receptor homotetramer likely arose from gene fusion events that occurred early in evolution. Although this modular design has greatly facilitated biophysical and structural studies on individual iGluR domains, and suggested conserved mechanisms for iGluR gating, recent work is beginning to reveal unanticipated diversity in the structure, allosteric regulation, and assembly of iGluR subtypes.", "citation_paragraph": "The NMDA-receptor ATDs contain binding sites for drugs with therapeutic potential in neurological and psychiatric disease. Based on homology with bacterial periplasmic binding proteins like LIVBP, models have been developed in which ligands bind within the clamshell for individual ATD protomers, such that the resulting domain closure ''pulls'' on the LBD layer, reducing the stability of the agonist-bound active dimer conformation (Gielen et al., 2008; Mayer, 2006) . The recently solved crystal structures of the GluN1/GluN2B ATD heterodimer assembly in complex with either ifenprodil or the high-affinity analog Ro 25-6981 indicate that this model was too simple (Figure 5) . Surprisingly, ifenprodil and its analogs bind in a hydrophobic interface between the upper lobes of the GluN1 and GluN2 subunits and not within the cleft of the NR2B clamshell (Karakas et al., 2011) . ITC experiments on the isolated GluN1 and GluN2 ATDs clearly show that ifenprodil binds only to the heterodimer assembly, and not to the GluN1 or GluN2B subunits in isolation; complementary sedimentation experiments reveal a greater than 20-fold stabilization of heterodimer assembly by ifenprodil, consistent with the binding mechanism observed in the crystal structure. Another striking result from these experiments is the observation that all but one of the residues in the GluN2B subunit that interact with ifenprodil and Ro 25-6981 are conserved in the GluN2A subunit, which does not bind this class of drug. The results of site-directed mutagenesis experiments based on LIVBP-related homology models, which were designed to probe the binding sites for NMDA receptor allosteric modulators, are only in partial agreement with the new binding mechanism revealed by the GluN1/GluN2B ATD crystal structure. These results highlight the need for structural work on additional NMDA receptor subtypes and illustrate how much is left to learn.The GluN2B ATD also has a well-characterized binding site for Zn 2+ that inhibits NMDA receptor activity at mM concentrations (Rachline et al., 2005) . Surprisingly, the Zn 2+ ion binds at the entrance to the interlobe cleft in the GluN2B ATD structure, and not deep within the cleft as is often depicted in cartoons. The Zn 2+ ion is bound by residues in the upper (His 127) and lower (Glu 284) lobes, and thus likely stabilizes the closed-cleft conformation. The NR2B ATD also binds a cluster of Na + and Cl -ions, which are located deeper the interlobe cleft in the Zn 2+ complex and apo state structures. The function of these Na + and Cl -ion-binding sites is unknown (Karakas et al., 2009 ). It is interesting that there are binding sites for unidentified cations in the ATDs of GluR6 and GluR7 Kumar et al., 2009) ; the GluN1 subunit ATD also has a binding site for monovalent cations, which like that in kainate-receptor LBDs can bind either Na + , K + , or Rb + . The functional effects of ion binding at these sites in iGluR ATDs, which are present in loops projecting from the core of the protein, are also unknown.", "citance": "Surprisingly, ifenprodil and its analogs bind in a hydrophobic interface between the upper lobes of the GluN1 and GluN2 subunits and not within the cleft of the NR2B clamshell (Karakas et al., 2011) .", "claims": [{"text": "Ifenprodil binds in a hydrophobic interface between the upper lobes of the GluN1 and GluN2 subunits.

{"s2orc_id": 10449219, "title": null, "abstract": null, "citation_paragraph": "n autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus, there is evidence that B cells play a central role in the pathogenesis (1) (2) (3) . Disease-specific autoantibodies, produced by plasma cells (PCs) and/or plasmablasts, are commonly used in the clinic as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers (4, 5) . Likewise, in celiac disease (CD), a food-sensitive enteropathy with autoimmune features, IgA and IgG Abs reactive with transglutaminase 2 (TG2) are highly specific for CD (6) . The accuracy of the serological assessment is so high that an additional evaluation of intestinal histology is no longer considered mandatory to make the diagnosis of CD in children (7) . The anti-TG2 Ab response has two striking characteristics: 1) the Abs only occur in individuals who carry HLA-DQ2 of HLA-DQ8 (8) , and 2) their production is entirely dependent on dietary gluten exposure (9, 10) . A model where gluten-reactive T cells provide help to TG2-specific B cells by means of hapten carrier-like gluten/TG2 complexes could explain these clinical observations (11) .IgA PCs that are specific for TG2 are highly abundant in the duodenal mucosa of CD patients when the disease is active, and their frequency decreases on commencement of a gluten-free diet (GFD) (12) . Likewise, the titers of anti-TG2 Abs in serum drop dramatically within months after gluten is removed from the patients' diet, and the Ab levels correspond with the compliance of the GFD (10, 13) . To what extent the anti-TG2 autoantibodies contribute to CD pathogenesis remains to be established (14) . Studying the Ig repertoire of these autoreactive intestinal PCs and their unique features will be instrumental for the understanding of their role in the pathogenesis of CD.Expression of Ig on the surface of intestinal IgA PCs facilitates visualization and capture of Ag-specific PCs (12, 15) . Isolation of single TG2-specific PCs from the lesions of untreated CD patients and characterization of their Ig genes revealed a restricted repertoire with overrepresentation of IgH V region (IGHV)5-51 and IGVK1-5 gene segments, as well as limited somatic hypermutation (SHM) (12) . Human mAbs (hmAbs) expression cloned from such PCs demonstrated that the Abs are not polyreactive (12) and specifically target conformational epitopes of TG2 that are clustered in the N-terminal part of the enzyme (12, 16) . Four major epitopes could be identified, and the epitope reactivity of the hmAbs corresponded with the IGHV usage (12, 16) . Most of the IGHV5-51 Abs react with epitope 1, whereas most of the IGHV3 and IGHV4 Abs react with epitopes 2 and 3, respectively (12, 16) . Similar overrepresentation of IGHV5-51 gene had previously been observed among clones that were generated using phage display Ab libraries isolated from intestinal lymphocytes of CD patients (17) .The mucosal immune responses against T cell-dependent Ags show characteristics of secondary (i.e., memory) responses with rapid increase in the number of highly specific Abs toward the respective Ag upon rechallenge. Oral vaccination with cholera toxin induces long-lived PCs in the lamina propria and memory B cells (18) . Rotavirus memory B cells protect against reinfection via a mechanism that is dependent on the number of such cells in GALTs (19) , and rotavirus-specific PCs could be isolated from the duodenum of subjects with no recent infection (15) . These observations argue for the presence of gut PCs existing long after exposure to their Ags. In CD, TG2-specific PCs are present in the small intestine of many treated patients, which may suggest that some TG2-specific PCs are long-lived (12) . The presence of these PCs could also be explained by a continuous, yet slow, influx of TG2-specific PCs emerging from a pool of memory B cells. Characterization of the TG2-specific PCs in treated CD patients paralleled by analysis of memory B cells in blood could shed light on this issue.Whereas the characterization of Ig usage by single TG2-specific PCs gave valuable insight into anti-TG2 Ab characteristics, it gave information from few cells of a handful of patients, and only PCs of untreated patients were analyzed (12) . To characterize the response in greater detail, also from treated CD patients, we have used highthroughput sequencing (HTS), which allows accurate in-depth investigation of the Ig sequence in a large number of cells (20) . We performed comprehensive and comparative sequence analysis of the IGHV repertoire of PCs reactive or nonreactive with TG2 (i.e., TG2-specific or non-TG2-specific PCs) in untreated and treated CD patients as well as of B cells in peripheral blood of memory phenotype. We established that TG2-specific PCs are present in treated CD patients and that they share features of TG2-specific PCs from patients with active disease such as affinity maturation, clonal expansion, and overrepresentation of several IGHV genes. We identified rare TG2-related clones within the memory IgA pool and showed that they bear low number SHM and used an IGHV repertoire that is similar to their counterpart PCs in the gut. Furthermore, we demonstrated that such cells have the ability to produce anti-TG2 Abs upon stimulation. In light of these results, we suggest that autoimmunity against TG2 involves long-lived PCs whose persistence may have contribution from memory B cells.", "citance": "A model where gluten-reactive T cells provide help to TG2-specific B cells by means of hapten carrier-like gluten/TG2 complexes could explain these clinical observations (11) .IgA PCs that are specific for TG2 are highly abundant in the duodenal mucosa of CD patients when the disease is active, and their frequency decreases on commencement of a gluten-free diet (GFD) (12) .", "claims": [{"text": "IgA plasma cells that are specific for transglutaminase 2 accumulate in the duodenal mucosa on commencement of a gluten-free diet.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "IgA plasma cells that are specific for transglutaminase 2 are highly abundant in the duodenal mucosa of celiac disease patients when the disease is active.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "IgA plasma cells that are specific for transglutaminase 2 are scarce in the duodenal mucosa of celiac disease patients when the disease is active.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "IgA plasma cells that are specific for transglutaminase 2 decrease in the duodenal mucosa on commencement of a gluten-free diet.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

AIEC bacteria are able to replicate within epithelial cells after lysis of the endocytic vacuole and within macrophages in a large vacuole. CD-associated polymorphisms in NOD2, ATG16L1 and IRGM affect bacterial autophagy, a crucial innate immunity mechanism. We previously determined that defects in autophagy impaired the ability of epithelial cells to control AIEC replication. AIEC behave differently within epithelial cells and macrophages and so we investigated the impact of defects in autophagy on AIEC intramacrophagic replication and pro-inflammatory cytokine response. AIEC bacteria induced the recruitment of the autophagy machinery at the site of phagocytosis, and functional autophagy limited AIEC intramacrophagic replication. Impaired ATG16L1, IRGM or NOD2 expression induced increased intramacrophagic AIEC and increased secretion of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in response to AIEC infection. In contrast, forced induction of autophagy decreased the numbers of intramacrophagic AIEC and pro-inflammatory cytokine release, even in a NOD2-deficient context. On the basis of our findings, we speculate that stimulating autophagy in CD patients would be a powerful therapeutic strategy to concomitantly restrain intracellular AIEC replication and slow down the inflammatory response.", "citation_paragraph": "Impairment of autophagy in THP-1 macrophages treated with wortmannin, an inhibitor of the autophagic process that interferes with PI3K protein networks, significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner the percentage of intramacrophagic AIEC LF82 bacteria (Fig. 3A) . To mimic more specifically defects in autophagy associated with CD, due to polymorphisms in the autophagy-related genes, we used specific siRNA to analyse the effects of decreased ATG16L1 expression and over-or downexpression of IRGM on the control of the number of intramacrophagic AIEC bacteria. The efficiency of knock-down was checked by immunoblotting ( Fig. 3B ). Impaired autophagy in THP-1 macrophages transfected with siATG16L1 and siIRGM was confirmed by a decrease in LC3-II accumulation in Bafilomycin A1-treated macrophages compared with untreated cells (Fig. 3B ). Decreased expression of ATG16L1 resulted in significant increases in the numbers of intramacrophagic LF82 bacteria at 1 h and 8 h post infection (Fig. 3C) . Similarly, IRGM-decreased expression induced a significant increase in the percentage of intracellular LF82 bacteria at 8 h post infection compared with that observed in control siRNA-treated cells or untransfected cells (Fig. 3C ). Confocal microscopy examinations revealed that, at 8 h post infection, AIEC LF82-infected macrophages transfected with ATG16L1 or IRGM siRNA showed no significant difference in the proportion of AIEC bacteria located in LAMP-1-positive/LC3-negative vacuoles, compared with control siRNA-treated cells ( Fig. 3D and E). We also analysed the impact of IRGM overexpression on AIEC intramacrophagic persistence since we previously showed that both decreased and increased IRGM expression lead to a loss of control of intracellular replication of AIEC bacteria within epithelial cells (Brest et al., 2011) . IRGM overexpression in THP-1 macrophages led to an increase in LC3-II accumulation, which was in good agreement with previous data (Singh et al., 2010) , and indicates increased activity of the autophagic process ( Fig. 4A and B), and significant decreases in the number of intramacrophagic AIEC bacteria (Fig. 4C ). However, confocal microscopy examination of macrophage nuclei ( Fig. 4D and E) and analysis of caspase-3 cleavage (Fig. 4F and G) showed that overexpression of IRGM in macrophages induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner, leading to the release of bacteria in the extracellular cell culture medium containing gentamicin and making the quantification of AIEC intracellular persistence in such conditions undeterminable.To address whether Nod2-mediated autophagy is critical for AIEC persistence and/or replication in macrophages, in a way similar to previous observations in dendritic cells (Cooney et al., 2010) , we first analysed by immunoblot LC3-II conversion in peritoneal macrophages isolated from wild-type or NOD2 knockout (NOD2-/-) mice in response to AIEC infection (Fig. 5A ). LF82 infection of wild-type peritoneal macrophages induced an increase in the amount of LC3-II compared with uninfected cells (Fig. 5A and C) . In contrast, in LF82-infected NOD2-/-peritoneal macrophages, no significant increase in the amount of LC3-II was observed at 1 h or 2 h post infection compared with uninfected cells (Fig. 5A and C) . Of note, the basal level of LC3-II was higher in NOD2-/-macrophages than in wild-type macrophages (Fig. 5B) . Confocal microscopy examinations showed that at 1 h post infection a significantly higher number of AIEC bacteria were located within LC3-positive compartments in peritoneal macrophages isolated from wild-type mice than in those isolated from NOD2 knockout mice ( Fig. 5D and E) . We compared the ability of AIEC LF82 bacteria to survive intracellularly in wild-type and NOD2-/-peritoneal macrophages.

Desalinating seawater generally produces brine as a by-product that cannot be purified economically with current technologies and which is instead released to the environment. In this Perspective, we discuss direct electrosynthesis of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) from sea-water desalination brine as an emerging alternative solution. In this direct electrosynthesis (DE) process, the water splitting reaction is used to produce H+ and OH\u2013, which combine with the brine stream to produce NaOH and HCl. After introducing the scope of the process, we describe developments in earth-abundant catalysts for water splitting and the competing chlorine evolution reaction (CER), as well as challenges in inefficiency and productivity associated with these processes. Finally, we discuss the economic impact and feasibility of direct electrosynthesis. Desalination processes generally leave brine as a by-product, which is then discharged back into the environment. This Perspective looks at recent procedures for using this brine instead as resource for the production of hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide through direct electrosynthesis.", "citation_paragraph": "In order to further advance DE, catalysts that selectively produce oxygen while suppressing chlorine production under acidic conditions are required. Catalysts for splitting water have been extensively studied in both water oxidation, also referred to as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and water reduction, also termed the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In particular, much work has focused on HER and OER in the context of forming hydrogen as a solar fuel; where solar energy is used to drive the water splitting reaction, and is stored in the H-H chemical bond, either directly in a photoelectrochemical system, or by coupling an electrocatalyst with a photovoltaic cell [18] [19] [20] . The energy can later be released by burning the hydrogen or using it in a fuel cell. Additionally, HER can be used in chlorine production 21 , and OER can be used in metal-air batteries 22, 23 . Electrocatalytic OER and HER have been widely studied in these contexts, with several exhaustive review articles describing the variety of different catalyst materials that have been studied for both HER [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] and OER 25, 26, 29, 30 , as well as for selectivity of OER over the chlorine evolution reaction (CER); here, we provide a brief overview with a focus on how to apply these catalysts to DE systems.Two of the key parameters for electrocatalysts are the overpotential (energy required) and the price (material costs and stability). A given reaction has a certain thermodynamic potential, but it requires a driving force beyond this thermodynamic requirement; the overpotential (\u03b7) provides a measure of this required driving force on a given catalyst. The overpotential is defined as the difference between the applied potential and the thermodynamic potential (\u03b7 = E-E 0 ); increasing the overpotential will increase the current, as described by the Butler-Volmer equation, resulting in polarization curves such as those shown in Fig. 2a . Catalysts lower the activation energy by adjusting the binding energy of intermediates, so that the reaction can occur at lower overpotentials. The term overpotential is often used to describe the overpotential at a specific current density (typically 10 mA cm 2 , labelled j 10 in Fig. 2a) , which allows the facile comparison of catalysts when conditions such as the catalyst loadings are kept constant. The lower the overpotential required to reach a certain current density, the less energy required for the reaction to take place, providing efficiency and thus cost improvements 31, 32 . As for economic considerations, the standard OER and HER catalysts are based on ruthenium, iridium and platinum; thus, much recent work across laboratories has moved to developing active, stable catalysts made from earth-abundant, cheaper elements, such as carbon, cobalt, iron, molybdenum, nickel and sulfur 29, 30, 33 . The stability of catalysts also affects the economic feasibility of different electrolysis reactions. Catalyst stability is particularly important for scaling up, and academic stability studies have generally been limited to a few days 34 when performed at all (despite activity and stability often being inversely related 35 ). A comparison of several HER and OER catalysts are provided in Fig. 2b . Because pH plays a large role in a catalyst's activity towards HER and OER, the overpotential is provided for catalysts in both acidic and basic conditions. Note that the exact overpotential can be hard to compare across labs due to slight variations in the electrolyte, catalyst loading, support electrode and so on; however, the benchmark study by McCrory et al. provides a consistent comparison across several materials for HER and OER in both acidic and alkaline conditions 34 . The key challenge for implementing DE from the catalysis perspective is finding a stable OER catalyst with high activity for oxygen production as well as high selectivity over chlorine evolution. Catalysts that break scaling relations with defects such as dopants are a promising research direction for this area.HER electrocatalysts. Focusing first on catalysts for HER, noble metal catalysts for hydrogen evolution can achieve high current densities (and thus high hydrogen evolution rates) at low overpotentials, with Pt achieving 10 mA cm -2 at a <20 mV overpotential 36 . Thus, recent work has focused on developing less expensive catalysts with the same high activity level 25, 36 . These studies have spanned metals, alloys, dichalcogenides, phosphides and carbides, and have been summarized in detail elsewhere 20, 24, 25, 28, 33, [36] [37] [38] . Many studies have focused on HER in acidic media because the adsorption of hydrogen at low pH has a lower energy barrier, since adsorbed hydrogen can form by dissociating from hydronium rather than water 28 , and the mechanisms for this process in acid are well-studied 20, 27 . However, for direct electrosynthesis, as in standard chloralkali electrolysis, alkaline conditions are required (equation (1)).While the mechanistic understanding is lacking, many catalysts are also promising for hydrogen evolution in alkaline media (Fig. 2b) . Alkaline media can promote oxide formation on metal surfaces, but Ni, the most active non-precious metal, is stable and active at high pH 20, 25, 27 . Ni alloys have also been reported, particularly Ni-Mo catalysts with an overpotential <100 mV (refs. 26, [39] [40] [41] [42] ) that are highly promising for DE conditions. More recently, ruthenium-based catalysts on carbon-nitrogen supports have been reported with even higher activity in basic media 31, 43 . For all catalysts, long-term stability (in terms of maintaining activity over many months) must be shown before they can be used in an industrial process 25, 28, 36 .OER electrocatalysts. In a DE process, the oxidation side is less straightforward. OER is widely studied because it is applicable in a number of areas in addition to DE, including metal-oxygen batteries 22, 23 and solar fuels (including both water splitting to produce H 2 , and CO 2 reduction to produce hydrocarbons and alcohols) 19, 36 . However, OER is more kinetically hindered than HER because it is a four-electron process with chemically similar intermediates 19, 26, 29 . The binding strength of hydroxide, oxide and peroxide intermediates scale with each other on planar metal oxide surfaces 44 , so OER catalysts generally have much higher overpotential requirements than HER catalysts 36 ; indeed, the theoretical overpotential for OER is 300 mV unless the catalyst can be engineered to selectively stabilize only some of the intermediates 26, 36 . Additionally, the chlorine evolution reaction (CER) is a competing oxidation reaction that must be prevented in a DE system, making the oxidation reaction even more challenging. In terms of the OER catalysts themselves, RuO 2 and IrO 2 are the standard benchmark catalysts, but they contain relatively rare Pt-group metals (note that typically oxides rather than metals are used as OER catalysts due to the oxidizing aqueous conditions). Thus, many studies have moved towards the use of earth-abundant catalysts 26, 34, [45] [46] [47] . In order to design new earth-abundant catalysts, much of the work has focused on identifying the key descriptors of activity trends by looking at the electronic structure of the catalyst as well as the binding energies of the different intermediates 44, 46, 48, 49 . They found that the optimal binding surface will still have a relatively large OER overpotential due to scaling relations, since the OER intermediates are all chemically similar and their binding energies are correlated 26, 44, 48 . Based on this theoretical understanding of the binding energies, planar metal oxides are not expected to overcome these limitations. Recent work has instead moved onto developing different ways of introducing activity-improving defects such as grain boundaries and dopants, that could selectively stabilize some of the intermediates, for example by introducing nanostructuration, using alloys or altering the catalyst support 26, 50 . More specifically, these methods include sol-gel synthesis 51 , leaching a binary oxide 52 , sulfurizing or reoxidizing 53 and lithiation or delithiation cycles 54 . These studies included long-term activity measurements of the catalysts, which, in some cases, confirmed stable activity over several hundred hours 51, 54 . This research direction is also promising in the context of DE. Even more than for HER, the vast majority of electrocatalyst studies for OER investigate a pH window that is not applicable for use in DE 25, 34 . Instead of the basic conditions typically investigated, acidic conditions are required, as direct electrosynthesis will produce HCl in addition to O 2 (equation (3)). While many OER catalysts are either not active 34 or not stable 26, 30, 55 in acidic conditions, IrO 2 and RuO 2 catalysts can be used in acidic conditions 30, 34 (Fig. 2b) . More recent work has improved their activity and decreased their mass loading, including an IrO x /SrIrO 3 catalyst 52 as well as a thin ruthenia coating 56 , both of which achieved a relatively low overpotential (~280 mV for 10 mA cm -2 ) in acid. More work is needed in this area to further improve their activity.Competition between oxygen and chlorine evolution. In addition to having a high activity towards OER, a catalyst for the DE process should limit Cl 2 evolution at the anode. The relative selectivity of Cl 2 production versus O 2 production, primarily in the context of limiting parasitic oxygen production during a chloralkali process (that is, to selectively produce Cl 2 in aqueous conditions), has been studied for over one hundred years and was recently reviewed in detail 21 . Additionally, reactive chlorine species have been generated for wastewater treatment [57] [58] [59] . The reverse selectivity is of interest here (that is, selective O 2 production in the presence of Cl -), and has been investigated for seawater splitting (water splitting of brine solutions, where CER would compete with OER) 14, [60] [61] [62] [63] . A further description is provided by Nikolic and Panic (2014) 64 . Although OER is thermodynamically more favourable than CER overall, it is more kinetically hindered, in part because OER requires four electron transfers instead of the two needed for CER, leading to the higher theoretical overpotential requirement discussed above 65 . Instead, process conditions have typically been used to control selectivity 21 , for example the electrolyte pH. Indeed, CER is generally preferred at low pH 65 , and Cl 2 can be produced from neutral brine 58 or high concentrations of HCl (for example, 17%) 66 ; conversely, studies of oxygen production from seawater have primarily been performed at neutral or basic pH 60, 61 . In the acidic conditions required for DE, OER selectivity can be aided by a low concentration of chloride ions at the electrode surface 21, 64 or by increasing the overpotential 67, 68 . However, these conditions are not realistic for DE scale-up, and instead improved catalysts are needed. Additionally, the other ions present in seawater could make selectivity even more challenging. Recently it was found that the catalyst surface can be modified to control the CER versus OER selectivity. Initial studies suggested that OER and CER activities followed the same trend 63 , attributed to the scaling relation between the O and Cl binding energies 65 ; indeed, the OER catalyst RuO 2 is used as the catalyst in the widely used dimensionally stable anode (DSA) for chlorine production 32, 64 . However, despite these scaling relations, there are several recent reports of adjusting the selectivity of OER over CER using dopants to modulate the catalyst electronic structure and thus the active site 65, [67] [68] [69] [70] . Indeed, Zn-doped RuO 2 catalysts have selectivity for OER over CER (shown in Fig. 3) , with their activity being attributed to additional oxygen vacancies forming over Zn sites 70 . Conversely, studies on IrO 2 suggest that enhanced activity with Co and Zn doping stems from the dopant activating bridging binding sites that stabilize the peroxo OER intermediate 67 . Additionally, several MnO 2 -based materials have been found to be selective, although this was primarily studied in alkaline conditions and without probing the origin of the selectivity. A more recent 2016 study by Lin et al. 17 described in the previous sections, produced HCl and O 2 from aqueous NaCl using a titanium anode coated with Mn 0.84 Mo 0.16 O 2.23 , with an overall coulombic efficiency in the same range as BMED, at 65-88%. These doped oxide catalysts represent the most promising anode materials for DE at this time, although the origin of the selectivity was not discussed and therefore is challenging to apply to the development of novel catalysts. Additionally, novel catalysts for DE will need to be robust towards the variety of ions found in industrial brine. The conditions for DE have more contaminants such as Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ than typical water oxidation and warrant additional research into catalysts that can achieve high activities despite these constraints.Catalysts that break scaling relations using dopants and other defects to lower the overpotential for OER are particularly promising in the context of DE due to the competing CER. One key challenge with defect-driven activity is finding defects that provide high activity while remaining stable long-term.", "citance": "These studies included long-term activity measurements of the catalysts, which, in some cases, confirmed stable activity over several hundred hours 51, 54 .", "claims": [{"text": "Improvements in OER catalysts show stable activity over several hundred hours.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Sol-gel synthesis stabilizes earth-abundant catalysts over several hundred hours.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Methods: The study sample included 4,211 males and 4,009 females with mitochondrial DNA haplogroups and 4,788 males with Y chromosome haplogroups who are part of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Different subsets of these populations were assessed using the Developmental and Well-being Assessment (DAWBA), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), SCDC (Social and Communication Disorder Checklist) and Psychotic Like Symptom Interview (PLIKSi) as measures of behavioural and psychiatric traits. Logistic regression was used to measure the association between haplogroups and the traits above. Results: We found that the majority of behavioural traits in our cohort differed between males and females. However, Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA major haplogroups were not associated with any of the variables. In addition, secondary analyses of Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA subgroups also showed no association. Conclusion: Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA haplogroups are not associated with behavioural and psychiatric traits in a sample representative of the UK population.", "citation_paragraph": "Research on possible factors contributing to sex differences in behavioural and psychiatric traits has been limited 3 and this is the first investigation of the association of Y chromosome and/or mitochondrial DNA haplogroups with behavioural and psychiatric traits in children from the general population. We report here that there were more boys than girls with higher scores on behavioural and psychiatric trait scales. However, psychotic experiences were more common in girls than boys at two different time points. The haplogroup structure of Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA in ALSPAC is consistent with a population of English origin. Y chromosome or mitochondrial DNA haplogroups were not associated with behavioural and psychiatric traits in ALSPAC.There is convincing evidence that the Y chromosome is implicated in regulating differences in behaviour between the sexes in animal models. However, the biological mechanisms behind this are poorly understood. The difficulty in including the Y chromosome in GWAS is not contributing to improving understanding of the role of Y chromosome. The most convincing report of an association of the Y chromosome with a sexually dimorphic phenotype has been found in relation to coronary heart disease. In a cohort of British men haplogroup I was associated with a 50% increase in risk of cardiovascular disease with differential expression of macrophages between haplogroup I and other haplogroups 13 .Behavioural problems and psychiatric disorders in children and adults are highly sexually dimorphic. However, there are few reports of Y chromosome haplogroup investigations in psychiatric phenotypes. A previous study 15 found weak evidence of an association between Y chromosome haplogroups and autism and our findings are consistent with this. In a study of Y chromosome haplogroups and aggression in a cohort of men from Pakistan, there were no differences in mean scores of aggression across the five different haplogroups captured in the study 34 . Mitochondrial DNA has been investigated in relation to psychiatric disorders, although conclusions have been limited with small sample sizes and inconsistent reporting 19 .We investigated Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA haplogroups in children from a sample representative of the general population. The main strength of our study was the use of a large population of children from a homogeneous population. The ALSPAC study participants come from a small geographic region in the South West of England. Only participants of European origin were included in the study as part of the quality control protocol of the GWAS. All of our analyses were performed within the same population and did not require a control group, which could have resulted in issues with population stratification due to imperfect matching of cases and controls. This can be an important issue in Y chromosome analysis because even populations from the same country can have different Y chromosome haplogroup structure. We were also able to access data on different behavioural and psychiatric trait scales, such as the SDQ and DAWBA, which have been used extensively in population cohorts for research purposes.One of the limitations of our study was the small number of individuals in some of the haplogroups. However, this is expected due to the rarity of certain Y chromosome haplogroups in European populations. Another challenge in the study was presented by the distribution of behavioural and psychiatric traits in the general population. A large number of individuals did not have any symptoms.

Also, we only investigated common variants and not copy-number variation or rare variants.Although we do not report an association between the Y chromosome haplogroups and mitochondrial DNA haplogroups and risk of behavioural and psychiatric problems in the general population, we consider that our study has important implications; it highlights that if there are common variants on the Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA associated with behavioural problems, they are of small effect size and would require large collaborative efforts to be identified. Given that the DNA markers on the Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA are available on most GWAS chips but have not been largely utilised, such a collaborative effort would involve extracting relevant data from multiple studies rather than new genotyping efforts and could be an important step in understanding non-autosomal variation.

In addition, all clinical microbiology FoodNet laboratories were surveyed to determine their practices for isolating Salmonella. Telephone interviews were also conducted among residents of the FoodNet sites to determine the proportion of persons with diarrheal illness who sought medical care and the proportion who submitted stool specimens for bacterial culture. Using our model, we estimated that there were 1.4 million nontyphoidal Salmonella infections in the United States, resulting in 168,000 physician office visits per year during 1996-1999. Including both culture-confirmed infections and those not confirmed by culture, we estimated that Salmonella infections resulted in 15,000 hospitalizations and 400 deaths annually. These estimates indicate that salmonellosis presents a major ongoing burden to public health.", "citation_paragraph": "Using FoodNet surveillance data from 1996 through 1999 and related surveys, we estimate that, each year in the United States, \u223c1.4 million persons are infected with nontyphoidal Salmonella, which results in \u223c15,000 hospitalizations and \u223c400 deaths. Previous estimates of the burden of Salmonella infection in the United States have been based on a variety of methods, including a meta-analysis of published outbreak reports to calculate surveillance multipliers [1] [2] [3] [4] . Such methods yielded estimates of Salmonella infection that ranged from 800,000 to 4 million cases annually, with estimates of 18,000 hospitalizations and 500 deaths. Since the institution of FoodNet, however, we have become able to calculate population-based estimates of the number of Salmonella infections in the United States. These estimates can be used to calculate the morbidity rate, mortality rate, and economic burden imposed by Salmonella and other bacterial enteric infections, as well as to calculate cost-effectiveness ratios for various food-safety interventions.Our estimated annual number of culture-confirmed cases (36,242), which we derived by age-adjusting and extrapolating FoodNet data to the US population, is similar to that reported through national passive surveillance, despite regional variation for Salmonella serotypes within FoodNet surveillance areas [21] and nationally [31] . The mean number of nontyphoidal Salmonella infections in the United States from 1996 through 1999, as reported by national passive surveillance data, was 32,926, with an associated incidence of 12.3 cases/100,000 population. Furthermore, despite the variation in the prevalence of infection with different Salmonella serotypes among the FoodNet areas, the overall incidence of Salmonella infection among the FoodNet areas was similar, which suggests that the incidence may be relatively homogeneous across the states. These data support the conclusion that national passive surveillance for Salmonella infection is relatively complete and that the incidence of Salmonella infection within the FoodNet areas may reflect the national incidence. After estimating the number of culture-confirmed infections in the United States, we extrapolated, using \"multipliers\" of surveillance artifacts (care seeking, stool submission, laboratory testing, and culture sensitivity) to estimate the total number of Salmonella infections. Using this method, we estimated that there were 38.6 cases of Salmonella infection for each culture-confirmed case. Using a similar method, Chalker and Blaser [2] calculated a multiplier of 39 to estimate the total number of cases of salmonellosis in the United States, including asymptomatic infections. Mead et al. [5] used a multiplier of 38 that was based on preliminary FoodNet data. In a study of infectious intestinal diseases in England and Wales, researchers estimated that 3.2 cases of salmonellosis occurred for each case reported to national surveillance [32] . Differences in methods used in the 2 countries, in care-seeking behaviors by the 2 populations, in health care delivery, or in the epidemiology of salmonellosis may explain the differences between estimation multipliers used in the United States and those used in England and Wales.We determined rates of care seeking and stool-specimen submission from the population survey. Although these data allowed us to calculate a robust estimate of care seeking, data on stool-specimen submission were sparse. However, data from separate FoodNet surveys yielded remarkably similar estimates of the total number of stool samples submitted: the population survey data suggested 270,815 stool specimens, and the laboratory survey respondents reported testing 231,000 stool specimens during 1996. Further studies may determine whether the rate of care seeking and of stool-specimen submission change over time. If the actual proportion of persons with diarrheal illness who seek care or submit a stool specimen decreases, the multiplier and the resulting burden of illness estimate will increase.We also estimated the rate of laboratory testing and culturemethod sensitivity. The 1997 survey of microbiology laboratories in the FoodNet areas showed that all laboratories routinely tested stool specimens submitted for culture for Salmonella. This result was validated by that of a national study of 601 microbiology laboratories that showed that 99.3% routinely tested stool specimens for Salmonella [33] . However, infections may not be confirmed by culture because of the insensitivity of stool culture; the fewer the organisms in a specimen, the less likely that the culture is going to yield Salmonella. Isolation rates for Salmonella may also be affected by suboptimal handling of specimens, the selection of culture media, variations in laboratory testing, and receipt of antimicrobial treatment before culture specimens were obtained [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] . Considering these factors, we estimate that, although all laboratories routinely culture stool specimens for Salmonella, the sensitivity of stool culturing is only 70%. Further studies are needed to confirm this estimate; if the actual sensitivity is higher, our calculations overestimate the burden of illness imposed by Salmonella.Other sources of error in the present study may also have affected the estimates. First, we assumed that persons with diarrhea who sought care and provided specimens were as likely to have Salmonella isolated from their stool as were those who did not seek care or provide specimens. However, this assumption was based on the premise that physicians were randomly selecting patients for performance of culture instead of using objective criteria, training, and experience to determine which patients were likely to be culture-positive for Salmonella. Our model only accounted for one index of severity-bloody diarrhea. Thus, we may have underestimated the proportion of persons infected with Salmonella who provided stool specimens for culture and, therefore, we may have overestimated the multiplier for this step. For example, if the rate of Salmonella positivity was twice as high among the stool specimens requested by physicians as among those not requested (i.e., if the proportion of true positive samples tested was 36%), our estimate of the number of cases of salmonellosis per year would be reduced to 800,000. Second, we assumed that the rate of care seeking among all those with diarrheal illness was the same for those persons infected with Salmonella. However, persons infected with Salmonella may have a longer duration of diarrhea or greater severity of other symptoms and thus may be more likely to seek medical care than those with non-Salmonella diarrhea. If this were true, our estimate for the multiplier for this step would also be too high. Our estimates of disease burden are most sensitive to variations in the estimates of the percentage of persons missed because of mild disease or lack of stool culture. Third, FoodNet active surveillance, although population based, cannot guarantee complete case ascertainment. For example, stool specimens may be sent to laboratories outside the catchment area, not all of which may have been contacted. Loss of cases because of incomplete ascertainment would increase our estimate. Further studies are needed to evaluate these assumptions. Finally, the 5 FoodNet areas are not an exact mirror of the US population, and the extrapolation of FoodNet data to make national estimates could be affected by the sample of sites. However, because active populationbased surveillance was conducted in each of the FoodNet areas, we believe that these data represent the best available information.We have shown that salmonellosis is a major public health problem in the United States in terms of morbidity and mortality. The reinforcement of traditional disease-control methods and the use of novel interventions are necessary to reduce the burden of these illnesses. Since the recent introduction of the USDA's HACCP rule, fewer bacteria, including Salmonella, have been found on meat and poultry after processing. The irradiation of these products could further reduce the level of bacterial contamination [54] . Control measures that target other sources of Salmonella-such as eggs, pet reptiles, alfalfa sprouts, and juice-also play a role in disease prevention [55] [56] [57] . Finally, public health education campaigns, such as Fight-BAC, are targeting consumers and food handlers [58] . This broad strategy is necessary to curb the public health threat of foodborne diseases. Continued FoodNet activities are necessary to monitor changes in the burden and epidemiology of salmonellosis in the United States.", "citance": "In a study of infectious intestinal diseases in England and Wales, researchers estimated that 3.2 cases of salmonellosis occurred for each case reported to national surveillance [32] .", "claims": [{"text": "In England and Wales, 3.2 cases of salmonellosis occurred for each case reported to national surveillance.

Although the precise role of Nab4/Hrp1 remains unclear, it has been implicated in correct positioning of the cleavage site in vitro. Here, we show that mutation or overexpression of NAB4/HRP1 alters polyA cleavage site selection in vivo. Using bioinformatic analysis, we identified four related motifs that are statistically enriched in Nab4-associated transcripts; each motif is similar to the known binding site for Nab4/Hrp1. Site-directed mutations in predicted Nab4/Hrp1 binding elements result in decreased use of adjacent cleavage sites. Additionally, we show that the nab4-7 mutant displays a striking resistance to toxicity from excess copper. We identify a novel target of alternative 3\u2032 pre-mRNA processing, CTR2, and demonstrate that CTR2 is required for the copper resistance phenotype in the nab4-7 strain. We propose that alternative 3\u2032 pre-mRNA processing is mediated by a Nab4-based mechanism and that these alternative processing events could help control gene expression as part of a physiological response in S. cerevisiae.", "citation_paragraph": "We have identified a correlation between alternative processing, Nab4, and the copper response. We have shown that a nab4-7 strain displays a striking resistance to excess copper and that this resistance requires the presence of the CTR2 gene. We demonstrated that the CTR2 transcript has multiple 39 ends and that the cleavage site used is sensitive to the presence of functional Nab4. Interestingly, this exceptionally long 39 UTR, almost 600 nucleotides, places the CTR2 transcript in the top 2% of predicted yeast 39 UTR lengths. The average yeast transcript is estimated to have a 39 UTR of less than 100 nucleotides [16] . Moreover, the quantity of CTR2 transcript in the cell rises dramatically as the nab4-7 mutant strain is shifted to the restrictive temperature. Exactly how the alternative processing affects the function of CTR2 and how this allows the nab4-7 mutant cells to resist excess copper remains unknown. Whether the alternative 39 premRNA processing of CTR2 is directly responsible for the copper phenotype in unknown; however, the correlation between Nab4, CTR2, and alternative 39 pre-mRNA processing is too enticing to ignore.Interestingly, the 39 UTR has recently been discovered to play an important role in another metal-stress responsive pathway. During iron-stress conditions in S. cerevisiae, the cell relies on mRNA surveillance mechanisms to respond to low levels of iron. In iron-replete conditions, specific mRNAs are targeted for degradation via sequence elements in the 39 UTR of target transcripts [31] . Additionally, the absence of RNA surveillance pathways leads to sensitivity to high iron conditions in S. cerevisiae [32] . It remains to be seen if alternative 39 pre-mRNA processing of CTR2 plays into a similar mRNA surveillance pathway, as seen in iron stress. Nonetheless, the importance of the 39 UTR in different stress conditions emphasizes the potential for alternative 39 premRNA processing to effect cell physiology.Our study of alternative 39 pre-mRNA processing illustrates the utility of studying this process in a genetically tractable organism. Given our unexpected discovery of a role for Nab4 in copper toxicity, we suspect that other growth and stress conditions will reveal even more regulated, alternative processing events. Moreover, identifying the mechanism and consequences of regulated 39 pre-mRNA cleavage has proven time-consuming in metazoan cells. In S. cerevisiae, this type of analysis should be more facile than in metazoan cells.", "citance": "Additionally, the absence of RNA surveillance pathways leads to sensitivity to high iron conditions in S. cerevisiae [32] .", "claims": [{"text": "In S. cerevisiae, the absence of RNA surveillance pathways causes sensitivity to high iron conditions.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "In S. cerevisiae, the absence of RNA surveillance pathways reduces sensitivity to high iron conditions.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}
{"s2orc_id": 39284128, "title": "Role of the Tumor Microenvironment in Breast Cancer", "abstract": "In recent years, it has been shown that breast cancer consists not only of neoplastic cells, but also of significant alterations in the surrounding stroma or tumor microenvironment. These alterations are now recognized as a critical element for breast cancer development and progression, as well as potential therapeutic targets. Various components of the breast cancer microenvironment, such as suppressive immune cells, soluble factors and altered extracellular matrix, act together to impede effective antitumor immunity and promote breast cancer progression and metastasis. Stromal cells in the breast cancer microenvironment are characterized by molecular alterations and aberrant signaling pathways, some of which are prognostic of clinical outcome. Several new therapies targeting stromal components are in development or undergoing clinical trials. We focus herein on the composition of the breast cancer microenvironment and concomitant molecular alterations, the specific interplay between various cell types and cancer cells, and the clinical implications of these findings.", "citation_paragraph": "Cross-talk between epithelial and stromal cells is essential for the normal development and differentiation of the mammary gland. Physiological stroma maintains epithelial polarity and inhibits uncontrolled cell growth and neoplastic transformation [4] . For example, myoepithelial cells have been recognized as natural tumor suppressors in the breast and function as gatekeepers of tumor formation, since they produce the basement membrane (BM) and represent a physical barrier around luminal epithelial cells [5] . Studies in breast cancer xenograft models suggest that the loss of myoepithelial cells promotes the transition of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to invasive carcinoma [6] . Two models of the in situ-to-invasive carcinoma transition have been proposed: the 'escape' and the 'release' models [5] . The 'escape' model proposes that genetic changes in tumor epithelial cells enables them to invade tissue adjacent to the ducts, while the 'release' model suggests that an abnormal microenvironment leads to disruption of the BM and spread of the tumor epithelial cells into the stroma [5] . It is probably a combination of these two models that generates the key event of the in situ-to-invasive transition in breast cancer, emphasizing the necessity of changes in both the epithelial and stromal compartments for tumor formation and progression.Normal myoepithelial cells have also been shown to suppress growth, invasion and angiogenesis of breast cancer cells [7] . In cancer-associated stroma, however, myofibroblasts and fibroblasts seem to promote tumorigenesis and metastatic spread through complex paracrine signaling [5] , creating a receptive microenvironment and influencing cancer progression and metastasis. In many aspects, the associated tumor stroma resembles a healing wound with proliferation of fibroblasts and ECM remodeling but lacking physiological controls [8] . Accordingly, numerous studies have shown that inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 promote breast cancer progression and metastasis by acting on breast cancer stem cells [9] . For example, the chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand (CXCL)12 is physiologically important for initiating tissue regeneration and repair by recruiting C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4)-positive stem and progenitor cells [10] . CXCR4/CXCL12 signaling in the breast cancer microenvironment results in increased migration and proliferation of stromal cells as well as secretion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and consecutive tissue remodeling. Additionally, numerous studies have demonstrated that CXCL12 directly stimulates tumor cell migration and invasion as well as epithelial-mesenchymal transition via CXCR4 expression on cancer cells [10] [11] [12] . Thus, CXCR4 overexpression by breast cancer cells is associated with lymph node metastases and poorer clinical outcome [13] .", "citance": "Studies in breast cancer xenograft models suggest that the loss of myoepithelial cells promotes the transition of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to invasive carcinoma [6] .", "claims": [{"text": "In breast cancer, the loss of myoepithelial cells promotes the transition of ductal carcinoma in situ to invasive carcinoma.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "In breast cancer, the loss of myoepithelial cells slows the transition of ductal carcinoma in situ to invasive carcinoma.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Loss of myoepithelial cells prevent the transition of ductal carcinoma in situ to invasive carcinoma in breast cancer xenograft models.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Loss of myoepithelial cells promote the transition of ductal carcinoma in situ to invasive carcinoma in breast cancer xenograft models.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

The IFN-producing capacity of pDCs is regulated by specific inhibitory receptors, yet none of the known receptors are conserved in evolution. We report that within the human immune system, receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase sigma (PTPRS) is expressed specifically on pDCs. Surface PTPRS was rapidly downregulated after pDC activation, and only PTPRS(-) pDCs produced IFN-\u03b1. Antibody-mediated PTPRS crosslinking inhibited pDC activation, whereas PTPRS knockdown enhanced IFN response in a pDC cell line. Similarly, murine Ptprs and the homologous receptor phosphatase Ptprf were specifically co-expressed in murine pDCs. Haplodeficiency or DC-specific deletion of Ptprs on Ptprf-deficient background were associated with enhanced IFN response of pDCs, leukocyte infiltration in the intestine and mild colitis. Thus, PTPRS represents an evolutionarily conserved pDC-specific inhibitory receptor, and is required to prevent spontaneous IFN production and immune-mediated intestinal inflammation.", "citation_paragraph": "LAR-type receptor tyrosine phosphatases PTPRS and PTPRF regulate the development and function of multiple tissues including genitourinary tract, mammary gland, and brain. Here we show that PTPRS is also expressed in the immune system, where it appears specific for the pDC lineage in both humans and mice. This conserved pDC-specific expression is controlled by E2-2, a similarly conserved transcriptional regulator of pDC development and maintenance. In addition, we found that Ptprf is expressed in murine, but not in human pDCs. The expression of PTPRS was prominent on the surface of naive pDCs but was rapidly reduced upon activation, likely through internalization and/or shedding from the membrane. Notably, IFN-a-producing cells were contained in the pDC population with the lowest surface expression of PTPRS, suggesting that a threshold of PTPRS reduction might be necessary for cytokine production by activated pDCs.Consistent with the inverse relationship between PTPRS expression and IFN production, antibody-mediated crosslinking of PTPRS inhibited pDC activation in primary human pDCs, a human pDC cell line and in vitro-derived murine pDCs. Conversely, inducible knockdown of PTPRS and genetic reduction of Ptprs/ Ptprf in primary murine pDCs enhanced TLR-induced pDC activation. These combined data from diverse experimental systems in two species suggest that PTPRS (along with Ptprf in the mouse) is a pDC-specific inhibitory receptor. Indeed, antibodies to known inhibitory receptors including BDCA-2, ILT7, and SiglecH reduce IFN production by pDCs (Blasius et al., 2004; Cao et al., 2006; Dzionek et al., 2001 ). Furthermore, BDCA-2 and ILT7 are downregulated following TLR-induced pDC activation in vitro (Meyer-Wentrup et al., 2008; Tavano et al., 2013) . Unlike all these receptors, however, the expression and function of PTPRS in pDCs appear similar in mice and humans. The identification of a conserved pDC-specific inhibitory receptor strongly supports the genetic and functional conservation of the pDC lineage in mammals. It also highlights the evolutionary pressure for lineage-specific regulatory mechanisms that restrict the powerful cytokine-producing capacity of pDCs.The crosslinking of PTPRS inhibited both the IRF7-dependent pathway of IFN production and the NF-kB-dependent inflammatory pathway, suggesting that PTPRS might block an upstream tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent mechanism of pDC activation. Tyrosine phosphorylation is required for optimal IFN production by pDCs and involves both the Src family kinase pathway and yet unidentified Src-independent components (Balmelli et al., 2011; Fujita et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014) . Interestingly, the Src pathway also mediates the inhibitory signaling through ITAM-dependent pDC-specific receptors (Gilliet et al., 2008) . Thus, PTPRS might restrict tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent pathways downstream of TLR signaling in quiescent pDCs, whereas its rapid loss upon pDC activation might enable subsequent signaling by other inhibitory receptors. Whereas the physiological ligands of PTPRS in pDCs remain to be defined, they are likely to be broadly available in tissues to ensure constitutive signaling in the steady state. In that respect, known PTPRS ligands HSPG are major components of the extracellular matrix and cell membranes, and we here observed their inhibitory effect on pDC activation. Indeed, HSPG were recently proposed to inhibit IFN production by macrophages in the context of atherosclerosis (Gordts et al., 2014) . The HSPG that are most relevant for pDC function remain to be identified, and they might signal through PTPRS as well as other surface receptors on pDCs. Of note, BDCA-2 and SiglecH are lectins that appear to bind specific carbohydrate modifications, e.g., asialo-galactosyl oligosaccharides in the case of BDCA-2 (Riboldi et al., 2011) . Therefore, carbohydrate components of proteoglycans emerge as major regulators of pDC activity that restrict pDC activation through both conserved (PTPRS) and species-specific (BDCA-2, SiglecH) receptors.The biological role of pDC-specific inhibitory receptors is still poorly understood. Deletion of SiglecH, the only murine receptor known so far, did not cause overt autoimmune or inflammatory diseases. SiglecH-deficient mice show higher IFN response to murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), whereas other immune phenotypes in these mice are not pDC-intrinsic (Puttur et al., 2013; Swiecki et al., 2014) . We found that Ptprs reduction or DC-specific deletion on Ptprf null background caused mild spontaneous colitis that could be transferred with hematopoietic cells. Although the colitis in Ptprs-deficient mice (Muise et al., 2007) or in compound Ptprs/Ptprf mice (this study) might have complex origins and involve the function of LAR phosphatases in other cell types, the pDC-intrinsic function of Ptprs appears essential. Notably, pDC hyperactivation has been documented in inflammatory bowel disease (Baumgart et al., 2011) and in colitis associated with the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (Prete et al., 2013) . Consistent with the emerging key role of DCs as regulators of intestinal inflammation (Bar-On et al., 2011; Bogunovic et al., 2012) , our results suggest that a primary pDC hyperactivation might be linked to disrupted immune homeostasis in the intestine.In conclusion, we describe the LAR phosphatase PTPRS as an evolutionarily conserved pDC-specific receptor that restricts pDC activation and thereby maintains immune homeostasis. Due to their important role in autoimmune diseases such as lupus (Rowland et al., 2014; Sisirak et al., 2014) , pDCs have emerged as a target of immunotherapies such as antibodymediated depletion. Given the expression of PTPRS in non-immune tissues such as the brain, other pDC-specific receptors such as BDCA-2 might provide better targets for depleting antibodies (Pellerin et al., 2015) . On the other hand, the conservation and potent activity of PTPRS make it an attractive candidate for the modulation of pDC function, e.g., via cross-linking with non-depleting agonist antibodies. Conversely, recently developed peptides that selectively inhibit PTPRS (Lang et al., 2015) might be utilized to boost the insufficient activity of pDCs in conditions like chronic viral infections or tumors.", "citance": "Conversely, recently developed peptides that selectively inhibit PTPRS (Lang et al., 2015) might be utilized to boost the insufficient activity of pDCs in conditions like chronic viral infections or tumors.", "claims": [{"text": "In chronic viral infections or tumors, peptides that selectively inhibit PTPRS can be utilized to boost insufficient activity of pDCs.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

A number of different treatment options are available for the management of diabetes. Among them thiazolidinediones (TZDs) is an interesting drug class since it does not target the result of T2DM, i.e., hyperglycemia but rather some of the core mechanisms of the disease. Indeed, glitazones increase insulin sensitivity by activating the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3, which plays an important role in regulating various metabolic parameters. Although TZDs have an established efficacy in T2DM treatment, their usage during the past years was questioned following the emergence of some alarming data regarding their safety and especially the cardiovascular safety of rosiglitazone. As a result, there is often some skepticism about the current role of TZDs in T2DM management. This mainly affects rosiglitazone even leading to its withdrawal from several markets in contrast to pioglitazone, which has shown a beneficial cardiovascular profile. A comprehensive assessment of the benefit-to-risk ratio of TZDs is required in order to better understand the place of these drugs in T2DM management.", "citation_paragraph": "Pioglitazone has shown some promising effects regarding markers of CVD risk. In the Carotid Intima-Media Thickness (CIMT) in Atherosclerosis Using Pioglitazone (CHICAGO) study over an 18-month treatment period, pioglitazone slowed progression of CIMT compared with glimepiride in 462 adults with T2DM (p = 0.02; Mazzone et al. 2006) . Of note, the beneficial effect of pioglitazone on mean CIMT was similar across prespecified subgroups based on age, sex, systolic blood pressure, duration of T2DM, body mass index, HbA 1c value, and statin use (Mazzone et al. 2006) . It has to be underlined that in patients with T2DM, the measurement of CIMT significantly improves prediction of CVD risk compared with the Framingham Risk Score (Bernard et al. 2005) .In the Pioglitazone Effect on Regression of Intravascular Sonographic Coronary Obstruction Prospective Evaluation (PERISCOPE) study T2DM patients underwent coronary intravascular ultrasonography and were randomized to receive glimepiride (1-4 mg) or pioglitazone (15-45 mg) for 18 months with titration to maximum tolerated dosage (Nissen et al. 2008) . Atherosclerosis progression was measured by repeat intravascular ultrasonography in 360 patients at study completion. Pioglitazone significantly decreased the rate of coronary atherosclerosis progression compared with glimepiride (p = 0.002; Nissen et al. 2008 ). Pioglitazone has also been shown to slow progression of CIMT, independently of hyperglycemia improvement, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and systemic inflammation in prediabetes, suggesting a possible direct vascular benefit of the drug (Saremi et al. 2013) . In this study, the annualized rate of CIMT progression in individuals with IGT was reduced by nearly half during pioglitazone treatment (p = 0.01).Clinical studies have also corroborated an overall beneficial effect of pioglitazone on CVD. The Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events (PROactive) study randomized 5238 T2DM patients with evidence of macro-vascular disease to receive pioglitazone (15-45 mg) or placebo in addition to existing therapy (Dormandy et al. 2005) . Pioglitazone reduced nonsignificantly (10 %; p = 0.095) the primary endpoint [all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction (including silent myocardial infarction), stroke, acute coronary syndrome, endovascular or surgical intervention in the coronary or leg arteries, and amputation above the ankle]. Moreover, pioglitazone also produced a nonsignificant reduction in non-fatal myocardial infarction (including silent myocardial infarction) by 17 % (95 % CI 0.62-1.06). However, treatment with pioglitazone significantly reduced the risk of the main secondary endpoint [all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction (excluding silent myocardial infarction) and stroke] by 16 % (p = 0.027; Dormandy et al. 2005) .Recently the results of a 10-year observational follow-up of PROactive patients regarding CVD incidence after pioglitazone discontinuation were published (Erdmann et al. 2016 ). There were no statistically significant differences in the primary or main secondary endpoints for subjects originally randomized to pioglitazone and placebo, except for leg amputations during follow-up (4.1 % for pioglitazone, 5.6 % for placebo; p = 0.046). Therefore, the CVD benefits of pioglitazone did not have a long-term lasting effect after treatment discontinuation.In another study, patients who had a recent ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack and insulin resistance were randomized to pioglitazone or placebo (Kernan et al. 2016 ). The primary outcome was fatal or non-fatal stroke or myocardial infarction.

It has been found that the interaction between MOZ-TIF2 and CBP through the CID domain and the C2HC nucleosome recognition motif in MOZ are essential for transformation (68) . MOZ-TIF2 dominantly inhibits the transcription activity of CBP-dependent activation (e.g., p53 and nuclear receptors), which requires the CID domain. The nuclear localization of MOZ-TIF2 is abnormal, which is dependent on the MOZ portion of this fusion protein. CBP expression is decreased in the cells expressing MOZ-TIF2, which results in the depletion of CBP from PML bodies. The critical characteristics of MOZ-TIF2 are to disrupt the normal activity of CBP/CBP-dependent activators in acute myeloid leukemia (69) . MOZ-TIF2 binds to the promoter of RAR\u03b22, leading to the dissociation of CBP/p300, the abnormal histone acetylation and the downregulation of RAR\u03b22. MOZ-TIF2 was recruited to AML1 target promoters and upregulated transcription mediated by AML1. Both MOZ and MOZ-TIF2 were found to co-localize with AML1 (70) . MOZ-TIF2 impaired retinoic acid-mediated transcription activation of C/EBP\u03b2/CD11b, and inhibited nuclear receptor-induced gene activation through aberrant recruitment of CBP, which required both the MOZ and TIF2 domains of this fusion protein (71) .In a transgenic zebrafish model, spi1 promoter-driven MOZ-TIF2 expression induced the development of AML in 2 of 180 embryos expressing MYST3/NCOA2, in which kidney invasion by myeloid blast cells was observed (72) . MOZ-TIF2 interacted with PU.1 to stimulate the expression of M-CSFR, and PU.1 is required for the establishment and maintenance of LSCs by MOZ-TIF2.

MOZ-TIF2 can cooperate with FLT3-ITD to transform hematopoietic cells. STAT5 signaling is required for MOZ-TIF2-induced leukemogenesis. Deletion of STAT5 led to the differentiation of MOZ-TIF2-transduced fetal liver cells, and these cells lost their replating ability. The recipient mice transplanted with Stat5 \u2212/\u2212 MOZ-TIF2 leukemia cells have longer latency and incomplete penetrance. STAT5 is essential for the self-renewal of leukemia stem cells in MOZ-TIF2 driven leukemia (74) . Overexpression of HOXA9, HOXA10, and MEIS1 was observed in AML patients with MOZ fusions. MOZ-TIF2 forms a stable complex with bromodomain-PHD finger protein 1 (BRPF1), and MOZ-TIF2/BRPF1 associate with Hox genes in the MOZ-TIF2 driven leukemia cells. BRPF1 depletion disrupts the localization of MOZ on the Hox genes, which led to the inhibition of MOZ-TIF2-induced transformation. Moreover, mutant MOZ-TIF2 lacking HAT activity could not deregulate HOX genes or initiate AML. Thus, MOZ-TIF2/BRPF1 induces leukemogenesis through the upregulation of HOX genes, which is regulated by MOZ-dependent histone acetylation (75) .", "citance": "Loss of CSF1R impairs MOZ-TIF2-induced leuekmogenesis in mouse models and CSF1R inhibitors delay the development of MOZ-TIF2-induced AML (73) .", "claims": [{"text": "In mouse models, CSF1R inhibitors delay the development of MOZ-TIF2-induced adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML).", "subject": "CSF1R inhibitors", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "In mouse models, the loss of CSF1R facilitates MOZ-TIF2-induced leuekmogenesis.", "subject": "loss of CSF1R", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "In mouse models, the loss of CSF1R impairs MOZ-TIF2-induced leuekmogenesis.", "subject": "loss of CSF1R", "is_negation": false}]}

Cardiac dysfunction after palliative surgical procedures contributes to the high mortality of CHD patients. Autologous or allogeneic stem cell therapies are effective for improving cardiac function in animal models and clinical trials. c-kit+ cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs), the most recognized CPCs, have the following basic properties of stem cells: self-renewal, multicellular clone formation, and differentiation into multiple cardiac lineages. However, there is ongoing debate regarding whether c-kit+ CPCs can give rise to sufficient cardiomyocytes. A new hypothesis to address the beneficial effect of c-kit+ CPCs is that these cells stimulate endogenous cardiac cells through a paracrine function in producing a robust secretome and exosomes. The values of other cardiac CPCs, including Sca1+ CPCs and cardiosphere-derived cells, are beginning to be revealed. These cells may be better choices than c-kit+ CPCs for generating cardiomyocytes. Adult mesenchymal stem cells are considered immune-incompetent and effective for improving cardiac function. Autologous CPC therapy may be limited by the observation that maternal diabetes adversely affects the biological function of embryonic stem cells and CPCs. Future studies should focus on determining the mechanistic action of these cells, identifying new CPC markers, selecting highly effective CPCs, and engineering cell-free products.", "citation_paragraph": "Animal studies have indicated that maternal diabetes-induced heart failure (HF) can be characterized by a gradual loss of cardiomyocytes, and experimental inhibition of apoptosis is responsible for improving cardiac function (26, 28) .

HT remains the final end-stage therapeutic option to treat patients with CHD. However, there is a high risk of mortality after implantation because of CHD (31) . The survival at 3 months post-HT was dramatically worse in CHD patients than in those without CHD (32) .

{"s2orc_id": 26669376, "title": "Hyperbaric oxygen therapy decreases QT dispersion in diabetic patients.", "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is frequently associated with the malignant ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death. The QT dispersion is the difference between the longest and shortest QT interval calculated from the standard 12-lead electrocardiogram. The QT dispersion is suggested as an index of myocardial electrical activity. An increase in QT dispersion is associated with the malignant ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Diabetic patients receive hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy for non-healing lower extremity ulcers. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of HBO therapy on QT dispersion in diabetic patients. Thirty diabetic patients (18 male and 12 female, 59.9 +/- 10 years), who were planning to undergo ten sessions of HBO therapy in two weeks for non-healing lower extremity ulcers, were consecutively enrolled into the study. The 12-lead resting electrocardiography recordings were taken before the first HBO therapy and after the 10th HBO-therapy session. QT intervals were measured on electrocardiogram. QT intervals were corrected for heart rate by using Bazett's formula (corrected QT [QTc] = QT/ radical R - R [seconds]). QTc dispersion was significantly decreased from 59.8 +/- 17.4 msec to 52.2 +/- 15.5 msec after ten sessions of HBO therapy (p < 0.05). However, maximum QTc, minimum QTc and mean QTc did not change significantly after HBO therapy. We have concluded that HBO therapy may reduce the risk of malignant ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death in diabetic patients when applied repetitively.", "citation_paragraph": "QT dispersion is a strong predictor of cardiac death in patients with diabetes mellitus (Naas et al. 1998) . It was also suggested that QTc dispersion could be a better predictor of mortality than microalbuminuria in diabetics (Darbar et al. 1996; Sawicki et al. 1996) . Our study results demonstrated that HBO therapy decreased QTc dispersion in diabetic patients when applied repetitively for two weeks.Ischemic myocardium may play a significant role as an arrhythmic substrate due to intracardiac inhomogeneities of repolarization (Roukema et al. 1998) . Asymptomatic myocardial ischemia is of a high prevalence among diabetic patients even in the lack of significant coronary artery stenosis (Koistinen 1990 ). Although we induced the diabetic patients with documented coronary artery disease, we could not strictly clarify the absence of ischemia or coronary artery disease in our study group by invasive methods. Ischemia refers to lack of oxygen due to inadequate perfusion, which results from an imbalance between oxygen supply and demand. HBO therapy favorably increases oxygen content of plasma. Also HBO leads hyperoxia even in poorly perfused tissues. So improvement of silent ischemia induced by HBO may be one of the probable explanatory mechanisms for improved QT dispersion.Additionally, diabetes may lead increased pro-inflammatory response due to endothelial dysfunction, increased oxidative stress, aggravated platelet, and coagulation hyperactivity (Hink et al. 2001) . QTc abnormality was also suggested as a surrogate indicator of subclinical atherosclerosis, increased carotid intima media thickness, and future strokes in Type II diabetic patients (Cardoso et al. 2003) . Diabetes may also affect myocardial microvasculature negatively by inducing neutrophil and increasing cellular adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and P-selectin) in circulation (Niwa et al. 1996; Buras et al. 2000) . HBO may improve endothelial cell function, proliferation, and neovascularization by inducing reactive oxygen species at a plausible level. HBO induced those cardio-protection mechanisms may alleviate the tissue ischemia (Yogaratnam et al. 2006) . HBO treatment given prior to and during ischemic insult increased the survival of myocardium and ATP preservation (Yogaratnam et al. 2006 ). This was a significant finding which suggested that undamaged integrity of cellular structure and tissue was a prerequisite to gain the greatest benefit from HBO (Yamada et al. 1995; Chen et al. 1998) . We suggest that improvement in QT dispersion may be associated with various myocardial protection effects induced by HBO therapy. Early deterioration of cardiac neural regulation in diabetic patients is inevitable because of lack of tight glycemic control (Kempler et al. 2002) . Myocardial repolarization is under neural control and the heterogeneity might be affected by changes in cardiac neural activity induced by diabetes (Perkiomaki et al. 1996) . Sun et al. (2006) reported that HBO therapy improved cardiac neural regulation in patients with diabetic autonomic dysfunction. They concluded that the vagotonic effect induced by HBO therapy improved cardiac neural regulation (Sun et al. 2006) . Improvement of QTc dispersion of our study group might be ascribed to favorable effects of HBO therapy on diabetic autonomic dysfunction. Moreover improvement in QT dispersion may be resulted by summing of the vagotonic effects induced by a whole consecutive HBO therapy sessions (Lund et al. 1999 (Lund et al. , 2000 .Additionally, Earle et al. (2000) reported that urinary albumin excretion positively correlated with QT dispersion in type I diabetic patients. Importantly, they suggested that QT abnormalities can occur independently of autonomic dysfunction or myocardial ischemia in diabetic patients. Similarly, our study group is of high probability of having abnormal QTc dispersion due to diabetes and independently of ischemia or autonomic dysfunction. So HBO therapy may have been improved QTc dispersion in a study group similar to Earle et al. (2000) by cardio-protective effects of which the exact mechanisms could not be clarified yet.In this study we excluded the diabetic patients with documented coronary artery disease, but we did not strictly evaluate the absence of myocardial ischemia in study group. Also we did not evaluate the presence of autonomic dysfunction in study group. Those are the limitations of our study.We concluded that HBO therapy may improve the myocardial electrical homogeneity and reduce the risk of malignant ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death in diabetic patients.

However, implementation of PrEP presents significant challenges due to poor user adherence, low accessibility to ARVs and multiple routes of HIV exposure. To address these challenges, we developed the nanochannel delivery implant (NDI), a subcutaneously implantable device for sustained and constant delivery of tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) and emtricitabine (FTC) for HIV PrEP. Unlike existing drug delivery platforms with finite depots, the NDI incorporates ports allowing for transcutaneous refilling upon drug exhaustion. NDI\u2010mediated drug delivery in rhesus macaques resulted in sustained release of both TAF and FTC for 83 days, as indicated by concentrations of TAF, FTC and their respectively metabolites in plasma, PBMCs, rectal mononuclear cells and tissues associated with HIV transmission. Notably, clinically relevant preventative levels of tenofovir diphosphate were achieved as early as 3 days after NDI implantation. We also demonstrated the feasibility of transcutaneous drug refilling to extend the duration of PrEP drug delivery in NHPs. Overall, the NDI represents an innovative strategy for long\u2010term HIV PrEP administration in both developed and developing countries. Graphical abstract Figure. No caption available. HighlightsRefillable nanofluidic implant achieves preventive level of tenofovir diphosphate for HIV pre\u2010exposure prophylaxis.", "citation_paragraph": "TFV and FTC are effective at conferring protection from HIV transmission when adhered to daily dosing regimen. However, adherence remains an obstacle for effective HIV PrEP. Here we developed a sustained drug delivery implant for long-term release of TAF and FTC for HIV PrEP to overcome adherence challenges. We utilized TAF in our study due to its potent antiviral activity at 25 to 30-fold lower dose (10-25 mg) than TDF (300 mg). A 25 mg dose of TAF resulted in 5 times more intracellular TFV-DP and reduced systemic TFV exposure, when compared to a 300 mg TDF dose [54] . Though both TAF and TDF have similar HIV resistance profile, TAF has a higher inhibitory quotient and its resulting TFV-DP concentration in PBMCs diminishes the risk of developing resistance throughout the course of PrEP [55, 56] . Evidently, superior antiviral efficacy is achieved with low doses of TAF, thus allowing for compatibility in long-term drug delivery systems. While TAF and FTC are conventionally administered orally, research demonstrates comparable efficacy of subcutaneous TAF and FTC administration [24, 51, 57] . A study of subdermal implant for long-term TAF delivery in beagle dogs indicated that subcutaneous doses as low as 0.15 mg/day may be sufficient to maintain effective concentrations of TFV-DP in PBMCs [24] . Further, daily subcutaneous injections of FTC (20 mg/kg) and TFV (22 mg/kg) were demonstrated to protect against rectally transmitted SHIV in rhesus macaques [57] . Here we showed that subcutaneous TAF and FTC delivery via the NDI was achieved in rhesus macaques for more than two months, validating the use of the NDI as an effective drug delivery platform for HIV PrEP.As TFV-DP and FTC-TP concentrations in PBMCs are clinically accepted parameters for approximating threshold protective drug levels, we primarily focused on these active drug metabolites to determine the achievable drug concentrations via NDI-mediated drug delivery in rhesus macaques. We reported that subcutaneous delivery of TAF via the NDI was able to maintain TFV-DP PBMCs levels up to 12 times more than the preventative target of 40 fmol/10 6 cells over the course of 83 days. This suggests that sustained delivery via the NDI could allow for dose reduction of TAF. The long-lasting intracellular TFV-DP levels observed in rhesus macaques in our study were akin to levels seen in clinical studies, whereby average intracellular TFV-DP concentration ranged from 80 to 160 fmol/10 6 cells [25, 58] . Based on the increasing TFV-DP concentration in PBMCs over 70 days before drug refilling, it is conceivable that TAF release via the NDI could be sustained above preventative target concentration without transcutaneous refilling for at least six months. Preventative levels of FTC-TP were not achieved in our study, likely due to the high dosage required of FTC, which presents a significant limitation for drug delivery implants. An important factor for protection against HIV is sufficient drug distribution to tissues relevant for viral transmission. We demonstrated varying but sustained levels of TAF, TFV and FTC in plasma and TFV-DP and FTC-TP exposure in rectal mononuclear cells (with the exception of FTC-TP on day 70) throughout the duration of study. Our results showed TFV and FTC drug penetration in the rectum, cheek pouch, cervix, and inguinal LN (Fig. 7B) , further validating effective drug distribution from subcutaneous delivery via the NDI. Existing drug-eluting systems have a finite depot and lack methods for refilling upon payload exhaustion. We reported here a minimally invasive procedure to transcutaneously refill the NDI without device explantation, thereby extending the release duration of ARVs. This extension of drug release duration allows for the implants to potentially be utilized for many years. Drug loading ports in the NDIs were palpable under the skin in this study, allowing for transcutaneous refilling without requiring additional imaging technology to locate the ports.Considering the scenario that the ports may not be palpable, the ports can be visualized via ultrasound imaging, which is widely used in developed countries and a more accessible type of imaging modality in developing countries. After the transcutaneous refilling procedure, we observed increase in plasma TAF, TFV and FTC levels, along with rise in TFV-DP and FTC-TP levels in PBMCs and rectal mononuclear cells. The transient spike observed in TFV-DP and FTC-TP concentrations in PBMCs on day 72 could be attributed to the change from powder drug to drug in a liquid solution for transcutaneous refilling. The NDI implant was loaded with powder drug before implantation, which required dissolution in PBS (during priming of the device prior to implantation) and in physiological fluids (after implantation) over time before being released from the nanochannels. Because solubilized drug was used for transcutaneous refilling, it is possible that faster release from the NDI occurred, resulting in a spike in PBMCs concentration of TFV-DP and FTC-TP on day 72. The steep decline of TFV-DP levels observed two days after transcutaneous refilling was conceivably due to stability issues from the TAF drug formulation in solution. Similarly, we detected that FTC-TP levels gradually decreased two days after transcutaneous refilling, also potentially due to drug stability. As such, extensive formulation studies are required to improve drug stability in solution.Our study showed that the NDI could be an effective approach for delivering TAF-based HIV PrEP, as indicated by the clinically relevant TFV-DP concentration in PBMCs and drug exposure in tissues relevant to HIV transmission. This is relevant as PrEP with TDF alone was effective in sero-discordant couples [4] . While our results are encouraging, the study is not without limitations. Despite efforts to augment FTC levels by increasing reservoir and nanochannel size in our second study, the failure to achieve clinically-relevant preventative target portend the limitations of subcutaneous delivery of FTC via the implants. Although FTC is a broadly used ARV in dual drug combination strategies for HIV treatment and prevention, a major disadvantage is the large volume distribution required and short plasma half-life of 8 to 10 h, which necessitates a high daily dosage [47] . Because of this, the drug reservoir for FTC would need to be substantially larger, in addition to adoption of a membrane housing at least three times the number of nanochannels to achieve the desired dose. As such, the size required of the device for effective delivery of FTC itself as an active pharmaceutical ingredient without further formulation development would be impractical for subcutaneous implants. Numerous research groups are currently exploring approaches to extend FTC plasma half-life, such as investigation of nanocarrier-based formulations to enhance FTC loading and prolong intracellular FTC concentration [47] . In the second study, we encountered an issue with wound dehiscence over the smaller implant, NDI-TAF, which could be attributed to the age of the animals. As this occurred in the two geriatric animals, and not the younger animal, it is also possible that the implant design created a tension under the skin of the older animals, which is less elastic. This is an additional parameter to consider for subcutaneous implant design and procedures. Further, additional studies are needed to validate the preventive efficacy of the NDI-facilitated PrEP delivery using simian HIV challenge models. The clinical translation value of the NDI as a PrEP drug delivery system could be improved with a more potent formulation of FTC and with a dual chamber depot in a single device. Moreover, we are currently developing a refined drug delivery implant that can be controlled remotely via Bluetooth to tune the release of drugs via modulation of an applied electrical field to the nanochannel membrane as well as a safety mechanism for ceasing drug release via an external magnetic field [59-61].", "citance": "Further, daily subcutaneous injections of FTC (20 mg/kg) and TFV (22 mg/kg) were demonstrated to protect against rectally transmitted SHIV in rhesus macaques [57] .", "claims": [{"text": "In rhesus macaques, daily subcutaneous injections of tenofovir is ineffective at protecting against rectally transmitted simian-human immunodeficiency virus.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "In rhesus macaques, daily subcutaneous injections of tenofovir protects against rectally transmitted simian-human immunodeficiency virus.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Multiple osteoblast-like cells and signaling pathways are involved in the process of VC.

Identifying and isolating defined SSCs as well as illuminating their spatiotemporal properties contribute to our understating of skeletal biology and pathology. In this review, we revisit skeletal stem cells identified most recently and systematically discuss their origin and distributions.", "citation_paragraph": "Different from long bones, craniofacial bones are developed via intramembranous bone formation without intermediate cartilage, indicating that SSCs residing here prefer bone formation to chondrogenesis [99, 100] . Besides, there is little bone marrow space inside of the craniofacial bones compared with the long bones [101] . The gap between craniofacial bones is known as a suture. Premature closure of the suture characterizes craniosynostosis, a developmental craniofacial deformity accompanying with a series of severe consequences including increased intracranial pressure and craniofacial dysmorphism [102] . A cranial suture acts as the growth site for osteogenesis of craniofacial bones, and therefore, suture mesenchyme is postulated as a main source of craniofacial SSCs. The two SSCs we described in the following passage both reside within suture mesenchyme [103] .5.1. Gli1-Expressing Cells. Besides as a marker of MMPs (previously described in this review), Gli1 was initially regarded as a marker of MSCs in the cranial suture of adult mice [52] . Cranial Gli1 + cells share a lot of characteristics with MMPs. Cranial Gli1 + cells are capable of trilineage differentiation (osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic), but adipogenic differentiation ability of them was not comparable to that of the MMPs. Gli1+ cells can contribute to bone injury healing. Besides, they are regulated by Ihh signaling pathways, blockade of which could cause reduced bone volume.However, compared with MMPs, Gli1 + cells in cranial sutures can generate periosteum and dura but contribute little to bone marrow and vasculature. More importantly, Gli1 + cells in the suture mesenchyme are crucial for local homeostasis, and ablation of them using diphtheria toxin (DTA) resulted in a typical symptom of craniosynostosis, growth arrest, osteoporosis, and compromised injury repair.5.2. Axin2-Expressing Cells. Axin2, also known as conductin or Axil, is a negative regulator of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathways and thus plays a critical role in skeletogenesis. Axin2 can inhibit intramembranous bone formation, and the inactivation of Axin2 leads to craniosynostosis because of excessive intramembranous ossification [104, 105] . Of note, fate commitment of Axin2 stem cells is tightly regulated by interaction of several signaling pathways including FGF, BMP, and Wnt [106, 107] .Maruyama et al. identified that Axin2 can mark a group of SSCs or specifically termed as suture stem cells (SuSCs) [108] . Axin2 + SuSCs and their descendants were restricted within calvarial sutures and nearly absent in long bones, indicating that Axin2 + cells represent a totally distinct group of SSCs from those populations in the long bones. Axin2 + cells possess the capacity of self-renewal and colony forming and were able to give rise to osteogenic lineages during the developmental period and adulthood of mice. Axin2 + cells could strongly respond to bone injury through self-expansion and producing skeletogenic cell types including osteoprogenitors and osteocytes in vivo. Although Axin2 + cells did not differentiate into chondrogenic cells under normal conditions, they are committed to cartilage formation with BMP2 induction. Importantly, Axin2 + cells showed a great ability of bone regeneration upon implantation into the kidney capsule and they could contribute to the formation of the ectopic bone that appears to share morphological features with calvarial skeletons, which had little marrow structure. Further experiment indicated that the Axin2 + cells applied into the injury site can directly engraft into the regenerated bone and promoted osteogenesis. Axin2 + cells in the suture mesenchyme express little markers of MSCs except LepR but overlap a lot with Gli1 + cell population. Distinct from Gli1 + cells which appear to be located within the whole suture and contribute to calvarial maintenance of the vicinity of central bone plates, Axin2 + SuSCs were mainly located in the midline of the suture mesenchyme. The aforementioned differences indicate that the two groups of stem cells contribute to different parts of calvarium.", "citance": "Besides as a marker of MMPs (previously described in this review), Gli1 was initially regarded as a marker of MSCs in the cranial suture of adult mice [52] .", "claims": [{"text": "In the cranial suture of adult mice, Gli1 was initially regarded as a marker of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).", "subject": "Gli1", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 9897166, "title": "The Chemorepulsive Protein Semaphorin 3A and Perineuronal Net-Mediated Plasticity", "abstract": "During postnatal development, closure of critical periods coincides with the appearance of extracellular matrix structures, called perineuronal nets (PNN), around various neuronal populations throughout the brain. The absence or presence of PNN strongly correlates with neuronal plasticity. It is not clear how PNN regulate plasticity. The repulsive axon guidance proteins Semaphorin (Sema) 3A and Sema3B are also prominently expressed in the postnatal and adult brain. In the neocortex, Sema3A accumulates in the PNN that form around parvalbumin positive inhibitory interneurons during the closure of critical periods. Sema3A interacts with high-affinity with chondroitin sulfate E, a component of PNN. The localization of Sema3A in PNN and its inhibitory effects on developing neurites are intriguing features and may clarify how PNN mediate structural neural plasticity. In the cerebellum, enhanced neuronal plasticity as a result of an enriched environment correlates with reduced Sema3A expression in PNN. Here, we first review the distribution of Sema3A and Sema3B expression in the rat brain and the biochemical interaction of Sema3A with PNN. Subsequently, we review what is known so far about functional correlates of changes in Sema3A expression in PNN. Finally, we propose a model of how Semaphorins in the PNN may influence local connectivity.", "citation_paragraph": "Since the early 1990s, chemorepulsion has been recognized as an effective way to guide growing neurites towards their targets in the developing nervous system [1] . One of the protein families that has been extensively studied in the context of repulsive axon guidance is the Semaphorin family (reviewed in [2, 3] ). Although the secreted and transmembrane Semaphorins were initially identified as repulsive axon guidance cues [4] , in the past decade they have also been linked to many other cellular processes, including cell migration, proliferation, and polarization. Because of their role in these key cellular functions they also have been implicated in various diseases, including cardiovascular and immunological diseases and cancer [5, 6] . In addition, the repulsive properties of especially the secreted Semaphorins are thought to hamper regenerative processes following nervous system trauma [7] [8] [9] . Recently, studies have implicated Semaphorins in synaptic and structural plasticity (reviewed in [10] ) and in certain neurological diseases (reviewed in [11] ).Invertebrate, vertebrate, and viral Semaphorins all share a conserved Semaphorin domain. Semaphorins are divided into 8 classes, based on their structure and sequence similarities [12] . All transmembrane and secreted Semaphorins, except for Sema7A, use Plexins as signal transducing receptor. However, many Semaphorins make use of additional receptor components. For instance, all class 3 Semaphorins, except for Sema3E, require Neuropilin as ligand-binding receptor component to achieve repulsive guidance signaling through Plexins [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Other than Plexins, VEGFR2, ErbB2, and IgCAM can also be part of different Semaphorin receptor complexes (reviewed in [19] ). The outcome of Sema-Plexin signaling is, however, highly context dependent. For example, class 5 Semaphorins demonstrate repulsive properties on neurites that express chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) adjacent to Plexins while these same Semaphorins 2 Neural Plasticity turn into an attractive cue if neurites coexpress heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) with Plexins on their surface [20] . Binding of Semaphorin to its receptor complex starts an intrinsic signaling pathway that involves GTPases and the PI3K/Akt pathway and eventually leads to reorganization of the cytoskeleton [21] [22] [23] [24] . In addition, Semaphorin stimulation leads to an activation of the Plexin interacting protein MICAL (molecule interacting with casL) and to the phosphorylation of intracellular proteins of the CRMP (collapsing responsive mediator protein) family, which in turn affects F-actin and microtubule disassembly and thereby growth cone motility [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] .Next to their role in long distance axon guidance during development of the nervous system, Semaphorins also play a role in local target selection (reviewed in [10] ). Recent studies have shown that class 3 Semaphorins/Plexins complex regulates connectivity not only at a cellular but also at a subcellular level such as the formation of synapse and spine. In the developing spinal cord reflex circuitry, Sema3E is only expressed by motoneurons that innervate the cutaneous maximus muscle but not by motoneurons that innervate the triceps muscle [32] . PlexinD1 expressing sensory axons of the triceps muscle form direct synaptic contacts with their Sema3E negative motoneurons. The PlexinD1 positive sensory afferents of the cutaneous muscle are however repelled by Sema3E expressing cutaneous maximus motoneurons. As a result, sensory and motor neurons of the cutaneous muscle cannot form direct but only indirect synapses. Knockout of either PlexinD1 in the sensory afferents or Sema3E in the motoneurons does allow the formation of direct synaptic contacts between cutaneous sensory and cutaneous motoneurons. In addition, the Sema3E-PlexinD1 interaction specifically determines the number of glutamatergic connections formed between Sema3E expressing thalamostriatal projection neurons and the PlexinD1 positive direct pathway medium spiny neurons but not the PlexinD1 negative indirect pathway medium spiny neurons [33] .At a subcellular level, several Semaphorin family members have been shown to control multiple aspects of synapse formation during late development of the mammalian nervous system. Sema3A increases the clustering of pre-and postsynaptic proteins in cortical neurons in vitro without affecting the number of spines [34, 35] while Sema3F limits the number of dendritic spines distributed along the apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex, thereby locally restricting the options for synapse development on the apical dendrite [36, 37] . In the hippocampus, Sema5A limits the number of spines formed on the dendrites of developmentally and adult born granular neurons in a cell autonomous way. Mutant mice for Sema5A or its receptor PlexinA2 display an increase in glutamatergic synapses [38] . In addition, the transmembrane class 4 Semaphorins, Sema4B and Sema4D, have been shown to regulate GABAergic and glutamatergic synapse numbers in cultured dissociated hippocampal neurons [39] [40] [41] . Also in the developing cerebellum, Semaphorins control the number of synapses. Sema3A and Sema7A control the different stages of synapse elimination. In Purkinje cells knockdown Sema3A leads to an acceleration in synapse elimination while a knockdown of Sema7A results in an impairment of synapse elimination [42] . In addition, the diffusible fragments of processed Sema5B have the capacity to induce synapse elimination in cultured hippocampal neurons [43] . Besides their guidance role in neuronal circuit formation during development, Semaphorins can modulate the functional properties of established synapses in the adult brain. Sema3F application to adult hippocampal slices induces an increase in frequency and amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic currents in dentate granule neurons and CA1 pyramidal neurons [44] . However, application of Sema3A to the hippocampus results in a reduction in synaptic efficiency [45] . The continuous expression of some Semaphorins even into adulthood indicates that Semaphorins may be involved in sculpturing the neuronal circuits beyond the initial development of the nervous system [46] . A structure that is thought to play an important role in adult central nervous system neuronal plasticity is the perineuronal net (PNN; Figure 1 ) [47] . PNNs are highly condensed extracellular matrix aggregates that form around the cell bodies and proximal dendrites of many populations of neurons during the closure of a critical period [48, 49] . Recent work shows that the chemorepulsive proteins, Semaphorin 3A and Semaphorin 3B, are highly concentrated in the PNNs of distinct neuronal populations in the maturing brain and are therefore in an excellent position to control PNN-mediated neuronal plasticity during and/or beyond the critical period [50, 51] . In the following sections, we summarize the localization of Semaphorin 3A protein in the adult rodent brain [51] , review the biochemical data on the interaction of this protein with the extracellular matrix [52] , and discuss the possible role of Semaphorin 3A and Semaphorin 3B in PNNcontrolled structural plasticity.Neural Plasticity 3", "citance": "In the developing spinal cord reflex circuitry, Sema3E is only expressed by motoneurons that innervate the cutaneous maximus muscle but not by motoneurons that innervate the triceps muscle [32] .", "claims": [{"text": "In the developing spinal cord reflex circuitry, Sema3E is expressed by motoneurons that innervate the cutaneous maximus muscle.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Sema3E is expressed by motoneurons that innervate the cutaneous maximus muscle.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

At the population level, self-renewal and differentiation are the possible outcomes of stem cell proliferation; overall, however, stem cells are quiescent if compared with their direct progeny. The recent discovery of a particularly quiescent, or dormant, subpopulation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) raises a number of fundamental questions. As stem cell fate is influenced by the signals integrated by the stem cell niche, will dormant HSCs reside in specific dormant niches? Is the mechanism of dormancy common to multiple regenerating tissues or specific to the hematopoietic system? If cancer is maintained by a few cancer stem cells, do they also contain a subpopulation of dormant cells, and could this be exploited for therapeutic purposes?", "citation_paragraph": "Th e subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) represents one of the main reservoirs of neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult mammalian brain. NSCs in this region of the brain are characterized by the expression of the transcription factor Sox2 and divide infrequently. In transgenic mice harboring GFP under the control of the Sox2 promoter, fewer than 10% of the GFP + cells colocalize with cell proliferation markers [43] . A recent study suggests that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling is an important switch between the quiescent and the proliferative status of these cells [44] . Adminis tration of the BMP antagonist Noggin to mice treated with BrdU increased the proliferation of Sox2 + cells in the hippocampus by recruiting quiescent cells into the cell cycle [44] . Analysis of the DG in mice expressing GFP under the control of Hes5, one of the main targets of Notch signaling, suggested that the vast majority of Sox2 + cells with both radial and horizontal morphology also express Hes5 [45] . Similarly to what was reported for Sox2 transgenics, the administration of BrdU to these mice allowed the labeling of only a small fraction of NSCs, further supporting the notion that they are highly quiescent. When BrdU was administered for 15 days followed by a chase period of 30 days, only a few GFP + BrdU + cells were found in the DG and some of them were positive for PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen), indicating that NSCs shuttle between a mitotically active and a quiescent state. Interestingly, diff erent stimuli triggered the activation of diff erent subsets of GFP + cells; physical activity recruited radial quiescent cells into the cell cycle, whereas seizure induced by the administration of kainic acid resulted in the proliferation of horizontal GFP + cells. Although the existence of quiescent NSCs in the DG has been well documented, further experiments are still needed to determine their kinetics of cell division and establish whether these quiescent cells are in a dormant state similar to the one described for HSCs.", "citance": "In transgenic mice harboring GFP under the control of the Sox2 promoter, fewer than 10% of the GFP + cells colocalize with cell proliferation markers [43] .", "claims": [{"text": "In transgenic mice harboring green florescent protein under the control of the Sox2 promoter, less than ten percent of the cells with green florescent colocalize with cell proliferation markers.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "In transgenic mice harboring green florescent protein under the control of the Sox2 promoter, more than 50 percent of the cells with green florescent colocalize with cell proliferation markers.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}

Here, large-scale epidemiological studies have helped with clarification. In a large cohort analysis of over 170,000 youths aged 6 to 21 years old without known cardiovascular risk factors, diagnoses of cardiovascular events and symptoms were not associated with stimulant use [14\u2022] .

METHODS We identified and collated all the papers related to the 10/66 Dementia Research Group, including papers from groups who adopted the 10/66 methodology, that have been published in peer-reviewed journals.   RESULTS Over 200 papers including data from Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin America and the Caribbean were identified by this review. Many of the findings revolved around the epidemiology of dementia, mental health and non-communicable diseases, including the cross-cultural development and validation of measurement tools of cognition and functioning, need for care, care arrangements and mental health. Social ageing, care dependence and caregiver interventions were also topics that the group had published on.   DISCUSSION A body of evidence has been generated that has challenged the view, prevalent when the group started, that dementia is comparatively rare in LMICs. The experience of the 10/66 DRG has shown that descriptive epidemiological research can be important and impactful, where few data exist. Monitoring population trends in the prevalence and incidence of dementia may be our best chance to confirm hypotheses regarding modifiable risk factors of dementia.", "citation_paragraph": "The prevalence of dementia varied widely across the different 10/66 sites ( Fig. 3 [15] ), ranging from 4.8% in rural China to 12.6% in Cuba. The wide variation was thought to be the result of the fact that informants in least developed centres were less prone to report social impairment and cognitive decline, which are essential criteria for DSM-IV diagnosis, compared to informants in more developed centres (see section on care dependence below for possible explanations for this finding). This was the case even when an objective memory impairment was identified. It was also concluded that DSM-IV dementia may underestimate the prevalence of dementia, especially in areas with low awareness of dementia, and that the 10/66 prevalence estimates were more consistent with the 'Global Prevalence of Dementia' expert consensus that was carried out in 2005 [11] .The incidence of 10/66 dementia varied between 18.2 (95% CI 14.3-23.0) per 1000 person-years in Peru to 30.4 (25.5-36. 3) per 1000 person-years in Mexico. This was once again 1.4-2.7 times higher than the incidence of DSM-IV dementia [32] . Being male, having higher education and younger age were all protective of dementia. Specific cognitive tests including literacy, verbal fluency and motor sequencing had also similar protective associations with dementia, providing more supporting evidence for the cognitive reserve hypothesis [32, 33] .In 2013, the DSM-V was introduced, replacing the terms of 'cognitive disorder not otherwise specified' and 'dementia' with 'Mild' and 'Major' neurocognitive disorder [34] . The impact of DMS-V dementia criteria in LMICs has not been widely tested, but a small study carried out in the 10/66Indian site of Chennai showed that although DSM-V case detection is better than DSM-IV, its validity is not robust [35] .

Despite the overall incidence of HF remains approximately 25% lower in women compared with men, women account for 50-55% of the prevalent HF cases because of their greater life expectancy. Therefore, women represent a growing proportion of the heart failure epidemic. Around 35% of cardiovascular (CVD) mortality in women is due to HF (3) . However, women are yet understudied and represented in clinical trials, sometimes inadequately powered to detect a benefit of HF therapy.

They were able to make valid clinical interventions that contributed to patient care in the two hospitals during their clinical clerkship.", "citation_paragraph": "Rational use of medicines is used by the World Health Organization (WHO) to refer to when patients receive medications that are individualized in doses appropriate to their clinical conditions for an adequate period of time, which they should get at the lowest possible cost to them and their community [1, 2] . This Expert Committee definition infers that rational drug use involves both the prescription and dispensing of the right drug to the right patient. The WHO estimates that half of the medicines prescribed, dispensed and sold are inappropriate and half of all patients take their drugs incorrectly. This inappropriate use of medicines has no regional bias: studies have proven that it is a global healthcare problem, especially in the developing countries [3] [4] [5] . A salient implication of the definition by WHO is that rational use of medicines has medical, social and economic effects on the patients, and by extension, their communities. About 75% of the world population lives in the developing countries, 25-50% of whom have little or no access to essential medicine [6, 7] . Those countries have weak healthcare systems that have little or no capacity to monitor drug use adequately.Medication errors occur more frequently than expected. A mean prescription error rate of 28.7% was recorded in a retrospective study in Nigeria [8] , although a higher rate of 76.3% was recorded two years earlier [9] . Still in Nigeria, the incidence of self-reported medication error among doctors, pharmacists and nurses was 47% [10] . Lazarou et al. reported that in 1994 in US, fatal adverse drug events (ADEs) were the sixth leading cause of death. They also reported that 10.9% of all inpatients experience some ADEs, while 2.1% of admissions resulted in serious events [11] . Most medications errors occur at the point of selecting therapeutic plans for the patients [12, 13] . The importance of adding the expertise of a clinical pharmacist on the rounding process has been proposed as a way of addressing the occurrence of medication errors. This stemmed from the fact that lack of adequate information primarily about the therapeutic agent as well as the patients contributes a lot to medication errors. In the intensive care unit (ICU) alone, the inclusion of a pharmacist on a rounding team reduced the incidence of ADEs by two-thirds [14] .The rational use of the drug is important to ensure that those that have access to medicines optimally utilize them. This requires interventions at the points of prescription and dispensing of medicines. A Clinical intervention refers to an intentional action that is appropriately designed to produce a desired health-related outcome, thereby creating research evidence and knowledge [15] . Clinical intervention can be initiated by any health professional. The pharmacist is uniquely positioned between the prescriber and the patient. A pharmacist-initiated intervention can prevent or resolve the prescription error and even dispensing error [16] [17] [18] [19] . Over the years, Pharmacy practice has evolved from the traditional roles of drug dispensing and compounding to a more proactive approach to patient care. This involves the optimization of medication therapy and promoting health, wellness, and disease prevention through pharmaceutical care. The growth of Pharmacy practice has led to a need for modification of the training and educational requirements of pharmacists. Hence, training beyond didactic lectures in class is required, and is best achieved through clerkship/clinical rotation in hospitals. In Nigeria, the rotation is conducted in the final semester of undergraduate Pharmacy studies for about 3 mo [20] . Students undergoing clerkship are expected to rotate round all units in the hospital, learning skills that were not acquired through didactic lectures. The goal of the clerkship programme is to equip students with clinical skills, knowledge and professional behaviours necessary to care for the patient. It also furnishes them with the ability to identify and resolve drug-related problems through patient information retrieval and assessment. The several contributions of pharmacy students to patient care in the US have been mentioned to include the provision of patient education, optimization of pharmaceutical care for patients, and provision of information to other healthcare providers [21] . To optimize their contributions preparatory to their future role as pharmacists, the American Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE) recommends that the nature and extent of students' interactions with patients and other healthcare professionals should be documented and assessed.The impact of pharmacy students at clinical rotations in different practice settings has been evaluated in a number of studies [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . The studies measured the types and significance of the students' clinical interventions, and the cost-saving implications to the institution [21] . The primary purpose of our study was to assess student pharmacists' interventions during clinical ward rounds in a secondary and a tertiary hospital in Enugu State, Nigeria. This study is the first of its kind to be carried out in Nigeria since the inception of clerkship in Nigerian Pharmacy schools.", "citance": "In the intensive care unit (ICU) alone, the inclusion of a pharmacist on a rounding team reduced the incidence of ADEs by two-thirds [14] .The", "claims": [{"text": "Including a pharmacist on a rounding team raises the incidence of adverse drug events by two thirds in intensive care units.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Including a pharmacist on a rounding team reduces the incidence of adverse drug events by two thirds in intensive care units.

This reduction manifests as a decreased physiological reserve in response to stress (termed homeostenosis) and a time-dependent failure of complex molecular mechanisms that cumulatively create disorder. Aging inevitably occurs with time in all organisms and emerges on a molecular, cellular, organ, and organismal level with genetic, epigenetic, and environmental modulators. Individuals with the same chronological age exhibit differential trajectories of age-related decline, and it follows that we should assess biological age distinctly from chronological age. In this review, we outline mechanisms of aging with attention to well-described molecular and cellular hallmarks and discuss physiological changes of aging at the organ-system level. We suggest methods to measure aging with attention to both molecular biology (e.g., telomere length and epigenetic marks) and physiological function (e.g., lung function and echocardiographic measurements). Finally, we propose a framework to integrate these molecular and physiological data into a composite score that measures biological aging in humans. Understanding the molecular and physiological phenomena that drive the complex and multifactorial processes underlying the variable pace of biological aging in humans will inform how researchers assess and investigate health and disease over the life course. This composite biological age score could be of use to researchers seeking to characterize normal, accelerated, and exceptionally successful aging as well as to assess the effect of interventions aimed at modulating human aging.", "citation_paragraph": "Aging modifies the digestive, hepatic, and endocrine systems to varying degrees. The digestive system undergoes only modest changes with time, and normal aging does not cause malnourishment.

{"s2orc_id": 4495455, "title": "Skeletal muscle IL-6 regulates muscle substrate utilization and adipose tissue metabolism during recovery from an acute bout of exercise", "abstract": "An acute bout of exercise imposes a major challenge on whole-body metabolism and metabolic adjustments are needed in multiple tissues during recovery to reestablish metabolic homeostasis. It is currently unresolved how this regulation is orchestrated between tissues. This study was undertaken to clarify the role of skeletal muscle derived interleukin 6 (IL-6) in the coordination of the metabolic responses during recovery from acute exercise. Skeletal muscle specific IL-6 knockout (IL-6 MKO) and littermate Control mice were rested or ran on a treadmill for 2h. Plasma, skeletal muscle, liver and adipose tissue were obtained after 6 and 10h of recovery. Non-exercised IL-6 MKO mice had higher plasma lactate and lower plasma non-esterified fatty acids than Controls. The activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase in the active form was, in skeletal muscle, higher in IL-6 MKO mice than Controls in non-exercised mice and 6h after exercise. IL-6 MKO mice had lower glucose transporter 4 protein content in inguinal adipose tissue (WAT) than Control in non-exercised mice and 10h after treadmill running. Epididymal WAT hormone sensitive lipase phosphorylation and inguinal WAT mitogen activated kinase P38 phosphorylation were higher in IL-6 MKO than Control mice 6h after exercise. These findings indicate that skeletal muscle IL-6 may play an important role in the regulation of substrate utilization in skeletal muscle, basal and exercise-induced adaptations in adipose tissue glucose uptake and lipolysis during recovery from exercise. Together this indicates that skeletal muscle IL-6 contributes to reestablishing metabolic homeostasis during recovery from exercise by regulating WAT and skeletal muscle metabolism.", "citation_paragraph": "The major findings of this study are that an acute bout of exercise increased iWAT Glut4 protein in Control, but not IL-6 MKO mice, and that P38 Thr180/Tyr182 phosphorylation was higher in both adipose tissues in IL-6 MKO than Control mice 6h after exercise. This suggests that lack of skeletal muscle IL-6 reduced the ability to increase iWAT GLUT4 protein after exercise and resulted in increased stress kinase signaling in adipose tissue late in recovery from prolonged exercise. In addition, the results confirm that knockout of skeletal muscle IL-6 can increase PDHa activity in skeletal muscle and supports the hypothesis that skeletal muscle IL-6 may play a role in the regulation of carbohydrate and fat metabolism late in recovery from exercise. However, muscle IL-6 does not seem to be required for the regulation of hepatic gluconeogenic capacity late in recovery from exercise. Several studies have shown that IL-6 affects adipose tissue metabolism and lipolysis [14, 17, 30, 31] . Accordingly, the lower plasma NEFA concentrations in IL-6 MKO than Controls in the non-exercised mice indicates that lack of skeletal muscle IL-6 reduced lipolysis in adipose tissue or increased fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle. The findings that eWAT HSL Ser660 phosphorylation was lower in IL-6 MKO than Control mice suggests that muscle IL-6 influences plasma NEFA through effects on adipose tissue lipolysis. This, together with the observation that skeletal muscle PDHa activity was higher in IL-6 MKO than in Control mice and that skeletal muscle ACC phosphorylation was unaltered, strongly indicates that the change in plasma NEFA concentration was a result of decreased lipolysis in adipose tissue rather than increased fatty acid oxidation. The present finding that HSL phosphorylation was lower in IL-6 regulates metabolism during recovery from exercise recovery from exercise suggest that adipose tissue limits lipolysis in the hours after exercise to regain resting levels of plasma NEFA. Remarkably, iWAT HSL Ser660 phosphorylation was unchanged after exercise in IL-6 MKO mice and in eWAT significantly higher, indicating that IL-6 MKO mice was unable to regulate lipolysis during recovery from exercise. This may suggest that the lack of skeletal muscle IL-6 was associated with loss of lipolytic control both at rest and during recovery from acute exercise. A recent study suggested that increased lipolysis can lead to higher P38 phosphorylation in adipose tissue [32] . The present findings that P38 Thr180/Tyr182 phosphorylation was higher in IL-6 MKO than Control mice in both iWAT and eWAT 6h after exercise are in agreement with these observations and may indicate that knockout of skeletal muscle IL-6 led to intracellular stress in adipose tissue. It is noteworthy that several studies suggest that increased P38-phosphorylation in adipose tissue can lead to insulin resistance [32, 33] . Thus, it is possible that the elevated p38 phosphorylation in IL-6 MKO mice may have resulted in reduced insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue. Previous findings have shown that insulin increases GLUT4 expression in adipose tissue [34, 35] and the present findings indicate that plasma insulin increased similarly in Control and IL-6 MKO mice 10h after exercise. Therefore, it may be speculated that reduced insulin signaling in adipose tissue 10h after exercise accounts for the observed loss of the exercise-induced increase in iWAT GLUT4 protein content late in recovery from exercise in IL-6 MKO mice. These findings suggest that secretion of skeletal muscle IL-6 during exercise may be important for reducing lipolysis and stress kinase signaling in iWAT during recovery from exercise.IL-6 has been shown to be important for the regulation of glucose and fat metabolism in several studies [9, 10, 13, 14] . The observation that lack of skeletal muscle IL-6 did not alter ACC or AMPK phosphorylation in skeletal muscle 6 and 10h after exercise, suggests that skeletal muscle fat oxidation was unaltered, which is not in accordance with previous studies indicating that IL-6 increases fat oxidation [17, 31] . Furthermore, the increased skeletal muscle PDHa activity in the IL-6 MKO mice both at 6h after exercise and in non-exercised mice indicates that carbohydrate oxidation was higher when muscle IL-6 was lacking at these time points. On the other hand, the lack of genotype difference in PDHa activity at 10h of recovery may suggest that there could be a circadian influence on the IL-6-mediated regulation of PDHa activity. This possibility is in accordance with the previous observations that PDHa activity indeed oscillates in a circadian manner [36, 37] . The current findings, indicating that muscle IL-6 reduces skeletal muscle PDHa activity and hence likely carbohydrate oxidation, are in contrast to previous observations showing that IL-6 infusion in humans increased skeletal muscle glucose uptake [10] and increased GLUT4 translocation in C2C12 myotubes [38] . However, the present observation is in agreement with the previous finding that lack of skeletal muscle IL-6 increased PDHa activity in non-exercised mice and during exercise and resulted in higher respiratory exchange ratio (RER) during prolonged exercise [12] . Similarly, the previous finding that injection of IL-6 decreased PDHa activity in fed mice [11] further supports the current observation. Together this may suggest that skeletal muscle IL-6 is an important IL-6 regulates metabolism during recovery from exercise negative regulator of carbohydrate oxidation at rest and after exercise, but also underlines that IL-6 elicits pleiotropic effects, which may vary with changes in the metabolic conditions. The higher plasma lactate in IL-6 MKO than Control mice observed in non-exercised mice and 6h after exercise may seem contradictory to the finding that PDHa activity was higher and therefore potentially associated with reduced lactate production in skeletal muscle of IL-6 MKO mice. On the other hand, it may be that the higher PDHa activity reflects an elevated glycolytic flux and thus increased pyruvate and lactate production within muscle tissue of IL-6 MKO mice. Alternatively, hepatic lactate uptake may have been reduced when muscle IL-6 was lacking. However, the higher PEPCK protein content 10h after exercise in both genotypes, without changes in PEPCK mRNA and G6Pase mRNA or protein content, does not support that IL-6 MKO mice had altered gluconeogenic capacity, which is in line with previous studies [6, 39] . Thus, the increased plasma lactate concentration in IL-6 MKO than in Control mice may be due to reduction in hepatic lactate uptake, but the similarly reduced liver lactate 6h post exercise in both genotypes seems to indicate that the higher plasma lactate is because of higher peripheral lactate production.It remains unclear whether the effects of muscle IL-6 on glucose metabolism are directly exerted on skeletal muscle metabolism or via IL-6 mediated effects in other tissues or perhaps via other mediators. Hence, IL-6 has been shown to increase the production and release of Glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1) during exercise [40] , suggesting that increased levels of IL-6 during exercise may be important for the regulation of GLP-1 with concomitant effects on insulin secretion after exercise. Thus, it may be suggested that muscle IL-6 plays a dual role by regulating substrate utilization in skeletal muscle and improving insulin secretion after acute exercise. However, the present observation that plasma insulin was not different between genotypes does not support that muscle IL-6 affects post exercise insulin secretion.It has previously been reported that lack of skeletal muscle IL-6 did not alter muscle STAT3 phosphorylation or plasma IL-6 concentration during exercise [12] . In the present study, the plasma concentration of IL-6 did not differ significantly between genotypes, which may be due to the considerable variation in plasma IL-6 observed or that other tissues such as adipose tissue or immune cells may have compensated [41] . Several isoforms of IL-6 with different properties emanating from different tissues have also been proposed. As the current methodologies stand and with the knowledge about the biology of IL-6 it is not possible to distinguish between IL-6 emanating from differentsources. Thus, it is possible that redundant secretion from other tissues will have reduced the observed effects of skeletal muscle IL-6 knockout in the current experimental setup. Of notice is, however, that lack of skeletal muscle IL-6 nonetheless did result in changes in metabolic regulation, mRNA and protein levels in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue both in non-exercised mice and during recovery from prolonged exercise. The observation that these effects were not associated with detectable alterations in canonical IL-6 signaling in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, but that hepatic SOCS3 mRNA increased in Control, but not in IL-6 MKO mice 10h after exercise suggests that lack of skeletal muscle IL-6 influenced canonical IL-6 signaling in recovery from exercise only in the liver. Thus, it seems possible that the effect of skeletal muscle IL-6 knockout on skeletal muscle and adipose tissues were elicited through pathways other than canonical IL-6 signaling.In conclusion, the present findings may suggest that skeletal muscle IL-6 plays a role in the regulation of substrate utilization in skeletal muscle as well as the regulation of lipolysis, GLUT4 expression and stress kinase signaling, in adipose tissue late during recovery from exercise. In addition, skeletal muscle IL-6 does not seem to be required for regulation of the gluconeogenic capacity late in recovery from exercise.", "citance": "A recent study suggested that increased lipolysis can lead to higher P38 phosphorylation in adipose tissue [32] .", "claims": [{"text": "Increased lipolysis leads to higher P38 phosphorylation in adipose tissue.

Previous studies have shown that liraglutide exerts potent neuroprotective effects after brain injury. However, little is known if liraglutide treatment has neuroprotective effects after spinal cord injury (SCI). This study explores the neuroprotective effects of liraglutide and associated underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that liraglutide could improve recovery after injury by decreasing apoptosis as well as increasing microtubulin acetylation, and autophagy. Autophagy inhibition with 3-methyladenine (3-MA) partially reversed the preservation of spinal cord tissue and decreased microtubule acetylation and polymerization. Additionally, siRNA knockdown of GLP-1R suppressed autophagy and reversed mTOR inhibition induced by liraglutide in vitro, indicating that GLP-1R regulates autophagic flux. GLP-1R knockdown ameliorated the mTOR inhibition and autophagy induction seen with liraglutide treatment in PC12 cells under H2O2 stimulation. Taken together, our study demonstrated that liraglutide could reduce apoptosis, improve functional recovery, and increase microtubule acetylation via autophagy stimulation after SCI. GLP-1R was associated with both the induction of autophagy and suppression of apoptosis in neuronal cultures.", "citation_paragraph": "Trauma-induced SCI is a major cause of death and lifelong disability in the world. After crush injury, the initial injury period is followed by a longer secondary injury period including oxidative stress, inflammation, edema and apoptosis [30] . The main obstacle to recovery from the secondary injury phase is neuronal cell death. Several studies in vivo have demonstrated the presence of neuronal cell death and axonal interruption in acute CNS injury [31] [32] [33] . Studies including our work show that pathogenic factors such as reactive oxidative stress (ROS) can trigger apoptosis and delayed death of cells in the ischemic penumbral region due to a buildup of oxidative damage to macromolecules, such as protein and DNA oxidation [34] [35] [36] . Moreover, excess oxidative stress compromises the function of axon via accelerating the degradation of microtubules [37] . Microtubules and microfilaments are susceptible to oxidation, which inhibit the polarization of microtubules and cause the destruction of microfilaments in neurons [38] . So, the equilibrium of ROS shifts to favor ROS production after cerebral ischemia, leading to cell injury [39, 40] . Moreover, ROS contributes not only to macromolecular damage but also as signaling molecules that activate certain signal transduction pathways, including pro-apoptotic neuronal cell death signaling [41] . Bcl-2 family proteins including cytochrome c, AIF, endonuclease G, are activated and interact with each other to release the pro-apoptotic proteins, which accumulated in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. This sequence of events activates neuronal apoptosis [42] [43] [44] and is regarded as the 'intrinsic pathway'. Other signal transduction pathways activated by ROS include the PI3K, p53, and MAPK pathways, which can all modulate intrinsic apoptosis [45] [46] [47] . Liraglutide had been mentioned to attenuate oxidative stress in various studies. GLP-1 receptor activation by liraglutidegreatly reduced nitro-oxidative stress in endotoxaemic mice [48] . And liraglutidedecreased oxidized LDL-inducedoxidative stressand fatty degeneration via regulation of AMPK signaling [49] .Increasing evidences showed that inhibiting neuronal apoptosis is an effective approach to facilitate functional and pathological recovery after CNS injury [50, 51] . Several studies have demonstrated the critical effect of GLP-1R on reducing oxidative stress and inhibiting apoptosis. Activating GLP-1R stimulates the adenylyl cyclase signaling, causing an increase of cAMP levels, which activate PKA and subsequently phosphorylate CREB. Then activation of CREB by GLP-1R regulates the transcription of the bcl-2 family protein, which plays an important role in cell growth and survival [52] . The GLP-1 analog, exendin-4, protects against ischemia-induced neuronal apoptosis by inducing GLP-1R expression in a model for transient cerebral ischemia [53] . A 2-months prospective pilot study showed that liraglutide decrease oxidative stress induced by T2DM [54] . Additionally, liraglutide promotes neuron survival and attenuates oxidative stress induced-apoptosis in the brain [55] . GLP-1R antagonist exendin-(9-39) was shown to reverse the protective effects of geniposide via upregulating the level of cleaved caspase 3 and activation of apoptosis [56] . In our study, we used Bcl-2, Bax, and cleaved caspase 3 as markers to measure apoptotic activation after SCI. Bcl-2 inhibits apoptosis, Bax is released upon initiation of apoptotic process, and cleaved caspase 3 mediates cleavage of cellular components [57, 58]. Our results showed that liraglutide treatment markedly reduced expression of pro-apoptotic Bax and cleaved caspase3, and the decreased anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 in rats after SCI. We also demonstrated that the GLP-1R is mainly expressed in neurons rather than nervous system cell types in spinal cord tissue. GLP-1R expression increases after acute SCI, indicating that it may affect neuronal survival. To explore whether GLP-1R is neuroprotective, we knocked down GLP-1R in neuronal cells in vitro. GLP-1R siRNA reversed liraglutide's anti-apoptotic effect with H 2 O 2 stimulation, indicating that the GLP-1R was necessary to reduce apoptosis with liraglutide treatment after SCI.Several articles have reported an interaction between autophagy and microtubule stability [8, 16] . However, the mechanisms and reasoning for this remain poorly understood. Autophagy maintains cellular homeostasis by degrading cytoplasmic components including organelles or protein aggregates [59] . Increased autophagy has been reported after SCI as a self-protective mechanism in response to various injury-associated pathological factors such as energy deficiency and oxidative stress [60, 61] . In addition, many retraction bulbs, which are associated with disorganized microtubule structure, have been found in injured CNS axons [62] . Stable microtubular structures such as axonemes have been shown to contain acetylated alpha-tubulin with acetylation occuring after microtubule assembly [28] . Increasing microtubule acetylation repairs locomotor deficits and axonal transport caused by LRRK2 Roc-COR domain mutations [27] . Additionally, resveratrol inhibits axonal degeneration in Wallerian degeneration mice by activating SIRT2 (NAD-dependent tubulin deacetylase) [63] . Exendin-4 induces extracellular superoxide dismutase to combat oxidative stress through acetylation of histone H3 [64] . Interestingly, it was reported that autophagy is activated in both the early and duration of degenerating axons after SCI [65] , indicating that autophagy could potentially represent a therapeutic target to reduce axonal degeneration in CNS injury. Autophagy induction was shown to stabilize microtubules by degradading microtubule destabilizing protein in cultured CNS neurons as well as promoting axon growth. Furthermore, activation of autophagy by a specific autophagy-inducing peptide, Tat-beclin1, could promote microtubule polymerization, axon regeneration, and locomotor functional recovery in mice after SCI [8] . In this study, we found that liraglutide increased autophagic flux and microtubule acetylation in rats after SCI. Furthermore, we blocked the downstream of autophagy by bafilomycin A1 in PC12 cells, and the expression of LC3 was further up-regulated in liraglutide-treated cells [66] . However, siGLP-1R abolished this effect, which further indicated that liraglutide enhanced autophagy flux via activating GLP-1R. Moreover, autophagy inhibition with 3-MA (type III PI3 kinase inhibitor, which inhibits autophagosome formation) reduced microtubule acetylation in vivo, indicating autophagy was important for microtubule stability.GLP-1 analogs have been reported in the literature several times to exert neuroprotective effects via activation of autophagy [26] . However, it remains unclear whether liraglutide activates autophagy by binding to the GLP-1R. Beta-glycerophosphate -induced increase of p-mTOR Ser2448 , and p-S6K1 Thr389 were attenuated by liraglutide treatment of human vascular smooth muscle cells [67] . Inhibition of mTOR signaling is a classic autophagy activation pathway [68] . mTOR inhibition initiates autophagy through activation of type III PI3 kinase, which is necessary for autophagosome biogenesis. In addition, mTOR inhibition can activates transcription of lysosomal genes, which stimulate lysosomal biogenesis [69] . Previous reports have suggested that inhibiting the mTOR pathway could be neuroprotective by enhancing autophagy after CNS injury [70, 71] .In this study, we found that GLP-1R knockdown in neuronal cells in vitro significantly reduced liraglutideinduced autophagy. Liraglutide treatment inhibited mTOR activation, which was also reversed by GLP-1R knockdown. Moreover, GLP-1R siRNA prevented increased autophagic flux associated with liraglutide treatment. The ratio of p-mTOR/mTOR was increased in neuronal cultures under H 2 O 2 stimulation as well, indicated that GLP-1R knockdown could activate mTOR signaling and suppress autophagy activation (Figure 11 ).In summary, this is the first study demonstrating that liragutide facilitates better functional recovery and increased microtubule acetylation/polymerization concurrently in rats after SCI. Liraglutide's beneficial effects in the recovery process are mediated by autophagy induction and mTOR suppression. Importantly, the GLP-1R is essential for activation of autophagy with liraglutide treatment.. Liraglutide prevents SCI induced apoptosis in rats, but GLP-1R knockdown with liraglutide treatment abolished this anti-apoptotic effect in neuronal cultures. Thus, GLP-1R may play a key role in physiological recovery after CNS injury. Mechanistically, GLP-1R activation can subsequently activate autophagy flux, which is involved in both axon regeneration and microtubule stabilization preventing further damage after injury.", "citance": "Increasing microtubule acetylation repairs locomotor deficits and axonal transport caused by LRRK2 Roc-COR domain mutations [27] .", "claims": [{"text": "Increased microtubule acetylation exacerbates LRRK2 Roc-COR domain mutation induced locomotor deficits.", "subject": "Increased microtubule acetylation", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Increased microtubule acetylation repairs LRRK2 Roc-COR domain mutation induced locomotor deficits.", "subject": "Increased microtubule acetylation", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Increased microtubule acetylation repairs interference of axonal transport caused by LRRK2 Roc-COR domain mutations.", "subject": "Increased microtubule acetylation", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Increased microtubule acetylation worsens interference of axonal transport caused by LRRK2 Roc-COR domain mutations.", "subject": "Increased microtubule acetylation", "is_negation": true}]}
{"s2orc_id": 3899045, "title": "Short-term diesel exhaust inhalation in a controlled human crossover study is associated with changes in DNA methylation of circulating mononuclear cells in asthmatics", "abstract": "BACKGROUND Changes in DNA methylation have been associated with traffic-related air pollution in observational studies, but the specific mechanisms and temporal dynamics therein have not been explored in a controlled study of asthmatics. In this study, we investigate short-term effects of diesel exhaust inhalation on DNA methylation levels at CpG sites across the genome in circulating blood in asthmatics.   METHODS A double-blind crossover study of filtered air and diesel exhaust exposures was performed on sixteen non-smoking asthmatic subjects. Blood samples were collected pre-exposure, and then 6 and 30 hours post-exposure. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell DNA methylation was interrogated using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Array. Exposure-related changes in DNA methylation were identified. In addition, CpG sites overlapping with Alu or LINE1 repetitive elements and candidate microRNA loci were also analyzed.   RESULTS DNA methylation at 2827 CpG sites were affected by exposure to diesel exhaust but not filtered air; these sites enriched for genes involved in protein kinase and NFkB pathways. CpG sites with significant changes in response to diesel exhaust exposure primarily became less methylated, with a site residing within GSTP1 being among the significant hits. Diesel exhaust-associated change was also found for CpG sites overlapping with Alu and LINE1 elements as well as for a site within miR-21.   CONCLUSION Short-term exposure to diesel exhaust resulted in DNA methylation changes at CpG sites residing in genes involved in inflammation and oxidative stress response, repetitive elements, and microRNA. This provides plausibility for the role of DNA methylation in pathways by which airborne particulate matter impacts gene expression and offers support for including DNA methylation analysis in future efforts to understand the interactions between environmental exposures and biological systems.", "citation_paragraph": "Exposure to air pollutants is an increasing public health concern that has been associated with adverse health effects focused on cardiovascular and respiratory diseases [1] [2] [3] . Traffic-derived pollution appears particularly toxic, perhaps due to its abundance of fine particulate matter (PM) [4] . Ambient PM is a heterogeneous mix of components varying in concentration, and chemistry [5] . PM is associated with both chronic and acute effects on health [5] , including increased risk of lung cancer [6] [7] [8] , increased hospital admission rate for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases in both adults and children [3, 5, 9] , and increased risk for mortality [10] . In urban environments, the major contributor to fine PM (diameter between 0.1 \u03bcm and 2.5 \u03bcm) is diesel exhaust (DE) [11] . Due to its small size, fine PM can deposit deep in the lung, and its soluble components such as transition metals may cross the lung epithelium into systemic circulation and interact with internal organs [2] . On the cellular level, exposure to DE prompts the generation of reactive oxygen species, leading to oxidative stress and damage to cellular structures [12] [13] [14] . On the molecular scale, DE has been found to change microRNA expression, increase production of allergic antibodies, up-regulate mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory mediators and antioxidant enzymes, as well as decrease methylation of repetitive genomic elements [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . The hazardous effects of DE is also associated with asthma susceptibility and severity; for example, evidence links exposure to diesel exhaust with worse lung functions and increased airway resistance [20, 21] . However, the precise mechanism by which pollution exacerbates asthma is not yet fully understood [5] . It has also been hypothesized that exposure to DE may be partly responsible for the increase in allergic diseases in industrialized nations [22] .One possible mechanism through which air pollution impacts transcriptional pathways may be exposure-related epigenetic modifications. Epigenetics refers to persistent changes in gene regulation that do not involve changes in DNA sequence [23] . Arguably the most studied and bestunderstood epigenetic modification is DNA methylation, the covalent addition of a methyl group to a cytosine primarily in the context of a cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG). DNA methylation modulates gene expression, and can vary in response to external stimuli [23] [24] [25] [26] . DNA methylation is also commonly observed at repetitive elements. LINE1 and Alu generally have higher methylation than the rest of the genome, and their methylation level is negatively correlated with mobility of retrotransposons [27] . Increased mobility of these retrotransposons, especially at cancer-related genomic loci, is associated with mutation and higher tumorigenesis rates [27] . Many recent studies have shown that ambient particulate matter change methylation of LINE1 and Alu repetitive elements as well as that of pro-inflammatory and tumor suppressor genes [28] [29] [30] [31] . Thus methylation at repeat elements is responsive to environmental influences; this could affect chromosomal arrangements and gene expression, relating environment to disease.These epigenetic responses to environmental exposures are not limited to repetitive elements and particulate matter [23, 25, 32] . DNA methylation is an important mechanism through which the environment in general interacts with the genome, likely affecting phenotypic outcomes. Environmental effects with known DNA methylation associations include socio-economic status, pollution, stress, and personal habits such as diet and smoking [16, 23, 33] . Although the mechanisms behind these associations are still unknown, it is undeniable that there is a complex dynamic at play among environment, genes and epigenetics. As such, epigenetics presents an intriguing target for understanding the mechanisms behind the adverse effects of DE.Despite the numerous existing investigations regarding ambient particulate matter and DNA methylation, no controlled investigation of particulate matter on DNA methylation at sites distributed across the genome, an important starting point for unbiased mechanistic inquiry, has been reported. We were interested in understanding the systemic impact of air pollution from the perspective of DNA methylation, and thus focused on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We hypothesized that short-term exposure to DE would lead to changes in DNA methylation status of PBMCs at CpG sites across the genome in asthmatic individuals, especially in genes relevant to the etiology of allergic diseases. Furthermore, we speculated that we would also observe changes in methylation of LINE1 and Alu repetitive elements, given that repetitive elements have been shown to be sensitive epigenetic indicators of environmental exposure [16, 30] . Lastly, we investigated whether any methylation changes were linked to DE induced changes in microRNA expression that we have previously demonstrated in the same individuals tested here [19] .", "citance": "Increased mobility of these retrotransposons, especially at cancer-related genomic loci, is associated with mutation and higher tumorigenesis rates [27] .", "claims": [{"text": "Increased mobility of retrotransposons does not lead to mutation and higher tumorigenesis rates.", "subject": "retrotransposons", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Increased mobility of retrotransposons is assosciated with mutation and higher tumorigenesis rates.", "subject": "retrotransposons", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 14844276, "title": "Consequences of Membrane Protein Overexpression in E. coli", "abstract": "Overexpression of membrane proteins is often essential for structural and functional studies, but yields are frequently too low. An understanding of the physiological response to overexpression is needed to improve such yields. Therefore, we analyzed the consequences of overexpression of three different membrane proteins (YidC, YedZ, and LepI) fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the bacterium Escherichia coli and compared this with overexpression of a soluble protein, GST-GFP. Proteomes of total lysates, purified aggregates, and cytoplasmic membranes were analyzed by one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry complemented with flow cytometry, microscopy, Western blotting, and pulse labeling experiments. Composition and accumulation levels of protein complexes in the cytoplasmic membrane were analyzed with improved two-dimensional blue native PAGE. Overexpression of the three membrane proteins, but not soluble GST-GFP, resulted in accumulation of cytoplasmic aggregates containing the overexpressed proteins, chaperones (DnaK/J and GroEL/S), and soluble proteases (HslUV and ClpXP) as well as many precursors of periplasmic and outer membrane proteins. This was consistent with lowered accumulation levels of secreted proteins in the three membrane protein overexpressors and is likely to be a direct consequence of saturation of the cytoplasmic membrane protein translocation machinery. Importantly accumulation levels of respiratory chain complexes in the cytoplasmic membrane were strongly reduced. Induction of the acetate-phosphotransacetylase pathway for ATP production and a down-regulated tricarboxylic acid cycle indicated the activation of the Arc two-component system, which mediates adaptive responses to changing respiratory states. This study provides a basis for designing rational strategies to improve yields of membrane protein overexpression in E. coli.", "citation_paragraph": "Overexpression of membrane proteins is a major bottleneck in membrane protein research. E. coli is the most widely used vehicle for the production of membrane proteins. To facilitate isolation of membrane proteins it is best to overexpress them in the cytoplasmic membrane rather than in inclusion bodies (6) . Unfortunately such membrane-localized accumulation is usually toxic to the cell, thereby severely reducing overexpression yields. Although several reasons can be postulated, the underlying physiology for this toxicity is not understood, thus preventing the design of rational strategies to improve membrane protein overexpression yields. In this study, we characterized E. coli cells overexpressing three different membrane protein-GFP fusions in the cytoplasmic membrane. Overexpression of a soluble GFP fusion protein was used to distinguish between general overexpression effects and effects related to overaccumulation in the cytoplasmic membrane. Several complementary proteomics approaches were refined and adapted for this study and complemented by flow cytometry, Western blotting, and pulse labeling. In particular, the development of \"backed\" BN-PAGE gels greatly improved the relative quantification of membrane protein complexes.This study shows that the toxicity of membrane protein overexpression is primarily caused by a limiting Sec translocon capacity having a severe impact on both the cell envelope proteome and, surprisingly, also the cytoplasmic proteome. Two effects of the limiting Sec translocon capacity are especially noteworthy: (i) the aggregation of precursors of secretory proteins and of cytoplasmic proteins in the cytoplasm and (ii) the shifted and inefficient energy metabolism likely to be through redox activation of the Arc two-component system. Interestingly although the properties (such as number of TMDs and length) and functions of the overexpressed membrane proteins did not seem to influence the level of toxicity or proteome composition, there was a positive correlation with the amount of overexpressed material per cell. This is encouraging as it suggests that strategies to reduce toxicity and improve overexpression yields may be relatively independent of the type of membrane protein selected for overexpression. FIG. 7 . Western blotting analysis of purified cytoplasmic membranes. Cells overexpressing GFP fusion proteins and control cells were cultured, and cytoplasmic membranes were isolated as described under \"Experimental Procedures.\" Cytoplasmic membranes were separated by means of SDS-PAGE and subsequently subjected to Western blotting analysis with antibodies to SecY, SecE, SecG, L5, DnaK, FtsH, and HtpX.Our observations are summarized in Fig. 11 and discussed in more detail below.Toxicity Due to Limiting Capacity of the Sec TransloconUpon membrane protein overexpression SecA levels were increased. SecA expression is up-regulated when the Sec translocon-dependent translocation of the secretion monitor SecM is hampered (59, 60) . Therefore, increased SecA levels indicate that the Sec translocon capacity is not sufficient in cells overexpressing membrane proteins, albeit we did not observe decreased accumulation levels of Sec translocon components under these conditions. Quantitative analysis of the cytoplasmic membrane proteome showed that the levels FIG. 8 . 2D BN-PAGE methodology suitable for relative quantification and 2D BN-PAGE reference map of the E. coli cytoplasmic membrane proteome. A, to be able to use 2D BN-PAGE for relative quantification, a 1.0-mm-thick first dimension gel was cast on a polyester support (GelBond PAG film, Cambrex) (step 1). After the first dimension blue native run, lanes were cut (step 2); equilibrated in denaturing, reducing, and alkylating buffer; and submerged into a low melting agarose solution on top of a 1.5-mm-thick 10% Duracryl gel (step 3). 6 -12 gels were run in parallel in the second dimension in an Ettan DALTtwelve system (GE Healthcare) (step 4). Relative quantification of spot intensities was performed using PDQuest from BioRad (step 5). B, the cytoplasmic membrane proteome of E. coli BL21(DE3)-pLysS was resolved by 2D BN-PAGE. 150 g of cytoplasmic membrane protein were used for the analysis. Proteins were visualized by colloidal Coomassie stain. Proteins in indicated spots were identified by MS (Table II and Supplemental Table 3 ). of many endogenous membrane proteins and complexes in the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane were significantly reduced, indicating that the overexpressed membrane protein competes out endogenous membrane proteins. This is nicely illustrated by the observation that overexpression of the soluble protein GST-GFP leads to increased levels of the IPTGinduced LacY transporter in the cytoplasmic membrane, whereas membrane protein overexpression did not (13) . Furthermore the levels of membrane-associated ribosomes were increased upon membrane protein overexpression, whereas total levels of ribosomes in the cells did not change. This is in keeping with previous E. coli studies that showed that high rates of membrane protein translation result in more membrane-associated ribosomes (61, 62) . Our data suggest that upon membrane protein overexpression most Sec translocons are engaged in co-translational protein translocation, i.e. the biogenesis of (overexpressed) membrane proteins. As a consequence, only a few Sec translocons will be available for post-translational protein targeting, i.e. the translocation of secretory proteins. Indeed the levels of the processed forms of many secretory proteins were diminished, whereas their precursors accumulated in the cytoplasm as aggregates. It is not likely that the slightly reduced levels of the targeting chaperone SecB account for precursor accumulation upon membrane protein overexpression because upon overexpression of GST-GFP SecB levels were reduced to the same extent, and precursor accumulation was not observed.Taken together, the insufficient Sec translocon capacity has a severe impact on the composition and as a consequence also the functioning of the cell envelope as is evidenced by hampered cell division and reduced capacity of the respiratory chain. Surprisingly we did not detect up-regulation of markers for envelope stress, such as the periplasmic chaperone Skp or chaperone/protease DegP (data not shown and Refs. 63 and 64) , possibly indicating that the signal transduction of cell envelope stress is compromised. observed   FIG. 9 . Relative quantification of the cytoplasmic membrane proteome by 2D BN-PAGE. Cytoplasmic membranes of cells overexpressing GFP fusion proteins and of control cells were isolated as described under \"Experimental Procedures.\" Independent triplicates of cytoplasmic membrane isolates were analyzed by 2D BN-PAGE. Proteins were visualized by colloidal Coomassie staining, and differences between replicate groups were analyzed using PDQuest (Bio-Rad). Differential protein expression was analyzed using the Student's t test with a 95% level of confidence and a threshold for quantitative differences of at least 2-fold upon membrane protein overexpression (see \"Experimental Procedures\"). Proteins were identified by MS ( Fig. 10 and Supplemental Table 3 ). Identified proteins with differential accumulation levels are indicated by gene names. The accumulation levels of spots indicated on the control gel were decreased, whereas the levels of spots indicated on the YidC-GFP overexpression gel were increased compared with the control. LacY is in parentheses because its levels were significantly increased upon GST-GFP overexpression, however, not upon membrane protein overexpression.

Bladder cancer patients require lifelong invasive monitoring and treatment, making bladder cancer one of the most expensive malignancies. Lines of evidence increasingly point to distinct genetic and epigenetic alteration patterns in bladder cancer, even between the different stages and grades of disease. In addition, genetic and epigenetic alterations have been demonstrated to play important roles during bladder tumorigenesis. This review will focus on bladder cancer-associated genomic and epigenomic alterations, which are common in bladder cancer and provide potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for bladder cancer treatment.", "citation_paragraph": "Bladder cancer is the fifth most common malignancy in the United States, with an estimated 76,960 new cases and 16,390 deaths in 2016 [1, 2] . Up to 80% of bladder cancer cases are associated with environmental exposure. Tobacco use is most commonly associated with bladder cancer incidence, as smoking duration and density are directly related to increased risk [3] . Other common risk factors include chronic urinary tract infections, arsenic exposure, and occupational exposure to carcinogens in the rubber and fossil fuel industries [4, 5] . More than 90% of bladder cancer cases are diagnosed as transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs), 5% as squamous-cell carcinomas, and 2% as adenocarcinomas [6] . Approximately 25% of new TCCs are muscle invasive bladder cancers (MIBCs, high-grade stages T2-T4), while the majority of TCCs are non-MIBCs (NMIBCs, low-grade stages Tis/carcinoma in situ [CIS] , Ta, and T1) [7, 8] . MIBC patients have poor outcomes, with 10-year survival rates of only 50% as compared to the 80% 10-year survival rates of NMIBC patients [6] . The standard therapy of MIBC patients is radical cystectomy, followed extended lymph node dissection; this therapeutic regimen results in improved survival [7] . Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is also recommended after radical cystectomy and increases the likelihood of eliminating residual tumor cells.The prognosis for NMIBC patients is more favorable, with 5-year survival rates of 78% [2] , however, 60%-70% of these will relapse and 10%-20% will progress to MIBC [4] . The most challenging aspect of bladder cancer management is predicting and diagnosing tumor recurrence or disease progression. The current gold standard for monitoring bladder cancer recurrence is lifelong cystoscopy and cytology [8, 9] . Cystoscopic ex-amination allows for the direct visualization of the inside of the urinary bladder, but is invasive and expensive. Although urine cytology is widely used in the diagnosis of bladder cancer, it is less invasive, has low sensitivity in detecting low-grade tumors, and cannot completely rule out the presence of a tumor. Several new tests have been developed, such as nuclear matrixprotein-22 [10] , bladder tumor-associated antigen [11] , the ImmunoCyt assay (Scimedx, Denville, NJ, USA) [12] , and the Uro Vysion assay (Abbott Molecular Inc., Des Plaines, IL, USA) [13] . However, due to relatively low sensitivities and/or specificities, these methods have not been used in routine clinical tests [14] . Therefore, there is a crucial need not only for reliable, accurate and convenient methods of diagnosis and monitoring for the recurrence or progression of NMIBC, but also for the identification of novel therapeutic targets, especially for MIBC patients. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of bladder cancer genesis is of high importance for guiding clinical decisionmaking.

{"s2orc_id": 3462340, "title": "Saa3 is a key mediator of the protumorigenic properties of cancer-associated fibroblasts in pancreatic tumors.", "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by the presence of abundant desmoplastic stroma primarily composed of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). It is generally accepted that CAFs stimulate tumor progression and might be implicated in drug resistance and immunosuppression. Here, we have compared the transcriptional profile of PDGFR\u03b1+ CAFs isolated from genetically engineered mouse PDAC tumors with that of normal pancreatic fibroblasts to identify genes potentially implicated in their protumorigenic properties. We report that the most differentially expressed gene, Saa3, a member of the serum amyloid A (SAA) apolipoprotein family, is a key mediator of the protumorigenic activity of PDGFR\u03b1+ CAFs. Whereas Saa3-competent CAFs stimulate the growth of tumor cells in an orthotopic model, Saa3-null CAFs inhibit tumor growth. Saa3 also plays a role in the cross talk between CAFs and tumor cells. Ablation of Saa3 in pancreatic tumor cells makes them insensitive to the inhibitory effect of Saa3-null CAFs. As a consequence, germline ablation of Saa3 does not prevent PDAC development in mice. The protumorigenic activity of Saa3 in CAFs is mediated by Mpp6, a member of the palmitoylated membrane protein subfamily of the peripheral membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUK). Finally, we interrogated whether these observations could be translated to a human scenario. Indeed, SAA1, the ortholog of murine Saa3, is overexpressed in human CAFs. Moreover, high levels of SAA1 in the stromal component correlate with worse survival. These findings support the concept that selective inhibition of SAA1 in CAFs may provide potential therapeutic benefit to PDAC patients.", "citation_paragraph": "PDAC is characterized by a rich desmoplastic stroma composed mainly of a heterogeneous population of CAFs. A CAF subpopulation characterized by expressing PDGFR\u03b1 is thought to mediate an inflammatory response (21) . However, their putative protumorigenic activity has not been properly documented. Here, we show that PDGFR\u03b1 + CAFs possess protumorigenic properties in vivo based on their ability to promote the growth of coinjected pancreatic tumor cells in immunocompromised mice. This property is specific for PDGFR\u03b1 + fibroblasts isolated from PDAC tumors, since the corresponding PDGFR\u03b1 + fibroblasts isolated from normal pancreata inhibited tumor growth.Recent studies have described distinct populations of CAFs (6, 8, 44) . A subpopulation designated as \"myCAFs\" is characterized by elevated expression of \u03b1SMA and appears to localize immediately adjacent to the neoplastic cells. A distinct subpopulation, iCAFs, is located more distantly from the neoplastic cells and expresses low levels of \u03b1SMA. Instead, these cells display higher levels of secreted IL-6 and other inflammatory mediators (44) . The CAFs isolated in our study, based on the expression of PDGFR\u03b1, also have high levels of IL-6, suggesting that they may represent iCAFs. Other similarities between these iCAFs and the PDGFR\u03b1 + CAFs isolated here include significant up-regulation of cytokine/chemokine receptor-signaling pathways and JAK-STAT signaling. However, the PDGFR\u03b1 + CAFs characterized in this study display significant overexpression of innate immune response-related signaling and high enrichment in cell-to-cell junction pathways, two properties not reported in iCAFs, thus, suggesting that the PDGFR\u03b1 + CAFs described here might represent yet another subpopulation of inflammatory CAFs.Transcriptome analysis of the PDGFR\u03b1 + CAFs studied here revealed a series of selectively up-regulated genes compared with those fibroblasts present in normal pancreata. The top-scoring gene was Saa3, a member of the gene family encoding Saa proteins. In humans, SAA1 and SAA2 are secreted during the acute phase of inflammation and have been implicated in several chronic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, and amyloidosis. Another member of this gene family, SAA3, is not expressed in human cells but has been shown to be a major acute-phase reactant in other species such as rabbits and rodents (16, 45) . Murine Saa3 has been shown to be expressed in macrophages (46) and adipose tissue (47) . During inflammatory processes, Saa3 expression is effectively induced by Il-1\u03b2, Tnf\u03b1, and Il-6 through NF\u03baB signaling. Interestingly, these cytokines, as well as the NF\u03baB pathway, were found to be significantly up-regulated in our CAF dataset. Finally, a fourth member of this gene family, SAA4, appears to be expressed constitutively in the liver (48) .Germline elimination of Saa3 had no effect of PDAC development, as reflected by the similar number of lesions observed in Saa3-null mice and by the lack of benefit in survival. However, Saa3-null tumors exhibit stroma remodeling, including reduced fibrosis and ECM, infiltrating macrophages, and increased vessel density. Indeed, Saa3-null CAFs had an elevated angiogenesis signature as revealed by GSEA pathway analysis. It has been suggested that increased vessel density along with a reduction in fibrosis may improve the efficacy of chemotherapy treatments (23, 49, 50) . However, we did not observe a significant increase in the therapeutic benefit of tumor-bearing Saa3-null mice treated with gemcitabine alone, with gemcitabine in combination with clodronate, or with an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody.Saa3-null tumors were also less differentiated and more invasive, as suggested by a higher proliferation index and increased numbers of pancreatic CD133 + CSCs (32, 38) . In addition, Saa3-null tumor cells showed an enhanced migratory phenotype. We observed an unexpected abundance of Saa3-null tumor cells in the liver, constituting as much as 15% of all liver cells, during the early stages of pancreatic tumor development. However, these migrating tumor cells did not elicit metastatic outgrowths, possibly due to their observed lack of proliferative capacity within the Saa3-null liver microenvironment. Whether this migratory phenomenon is an intrinsic property of the Saa3-null tumor cells or is a consequence of the absence of this protein in liver tissue and/or in prometastatic macrophages remains to be determined. Interestingly, we observed that the absence of Saa3 in liver tissue of tumor-bearing mice inhibits the expression of the Saa1 and Saa2 isoforms. Since SAA1 has been described as a potent inducer of liver metastasis (7, 26) , the reduce levels of expression of Saa1/Saa2 in Saa3-null livers could explain why the abundant disseminated pancreatic tumor cells cannot form metastatic foci. Conditional ablation of Saa3 expression in specific cell populations, including tumor cells, CAFs, macrophages, and possibly other immune cells, should help to better define the role of Saa3 during the various stages of tumor development.Saa3 is required for the protumorigenic properties of CAFs. Indeed, orthotopic coinjection of Saa3-null CAFs with Saa3-competent tumor cells in the pancreas of nude mice significantly reduced tumor size. The inhibitory effect of Saa3-null CAFs was even more pronounced than that induced by NPFs. However, this inhibitory effect was not observed when we used Saa3-null tumor cells. Since loss of Saa3 expression had no significant effect on the tumorigenic properties of pancreatic tumor cells, the observed lack of an antitumorigenic effect of Saa3-null CAFs on Saa3-null tumor cells must be due to defective cross talk between Saa3-null tumor cells and Saa3-null CAFs. These results were also observed in vitro using tumor organoids, ruling out a putative role of a third cellular partner in this cross talk. These reconstruction experiments recapitulate the results obtained with Saa3-null mice in which both CAFs and tumor cells are devoid of Saa3, thus explaining why PDAC development is unaffected in Saa3-null mice. Taken together, these results underscore the critical role for Saa3 in mediating the interaction between CAFs and tumor cells and predict that selective elimination of Saa3 in CAFs might provide significant therapeutic benefit. Future studies using conditional ablation of Saa3 should help better define the protumorigenic role of Saa3 in CAFs.Comparative transcriptional profiling of tumor cells and CAFs expressing or lacking Saa3 revealed that Saa3-null cells display an increased proliferative signature and metabolic reprogramming and could suggest altered heterotypic cell-to-cell contact. Moreover, Saa3-deficient CAFs show reduced overall cytokine secretion, with the exception of the TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 pathways. This result was unexpected, since acute-phase SAA apolipoproteins have been reported to enhance the expression of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF\u03b1, IL-8, and G-CSF (51) (52) (53) . Likewise, proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF\u03b1 induce the synthesis of these SAA proteins (54) . Therefore, up-regulation of TNF\u03b1, NF\u03baB, and IL-6 pathways may result from an effort by the Saa3-null cells to induce the expression of Saa3, thereby generating an inflammatory loop. Finally, the reduction of glycolysis and the down-regulation of cholesterol homeostasis in Saa3-null CAFs, shown by GSEA pathway analysis, could contribute to their inhibitory activity on tumor cells observed in orthotopic coinjection experiments, by reducing nutrient transport.Comparative analysis of Saa3-competent and Saa3-null CAFs revealed minor changes in their transcriptome. However, we identified three overexpressed genes in Saa3-deficient CAFs. Of particular interest was Mpp6, a member of the peripheral MAGUK family of proteins primarily involved in controlling epithelial cell polarity (55, 56) . Mpps also function in tumor suppression and receptor clustering by forming multiprotein complexes containing distinct sets of transmembrane, cytoskeletal, and cytoplasmic signaling proteins (57) . Interestingly, Mpp6 overexpression appears to be responsible for the loss of the protumorigenic effect of Saa3-null CAFs. Indeed, knockdown of Mpp6 expression in these mutant CAFs restored their protumorigenic properties, as determined in coinjection studies with Saa3-proficient pancreatic tumor cells in nude mice. Interestingly, the expression levels of Mpp6 were unaffected by the presence or absence of Saa3 in tumor cells, suggesting that the functional relationship between Saa3 and Mpp6 might be limited to CAFs. Understanding the molecular pathways implicated in the inhibitory role of Mpp6 on the protumorigenic effect of CAFs should unveil novel therapeutic opportunities.Finally, we have interrogated whether our observations in GEM PDAC tumor models could be translated to a human scenario. As indicated above, the SAA3 locus is a nonexpressed pseudogene (41, 58) . On the other hand, the acute-phase SAA1 protein has structural and functional characteristics that closely resemble those of murine Saa3, suggesting that SAA1 and Saa3 could be ortholog proteins (59) . Indeed, SAA1 is overexpressed in human CAFs compared with NPFs. Moreover, high levels of SAA1 expression in the stromal component of human PDAC tumors correlate with significantly worse survival regardless of whether the tumor samples contain \"normal\" or \"activated\" stroma.", "citance": "It has been suggested that increased vessel density along with a reduction in fibrosis may improve the efficacy of chemotherapy treatments (23, 49, 50) .", "claims": [{"text": "Increased vessel density along with a reduction in fibrosis decreases the efficacy of chemotherapy treatments.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Increased vessel density along with a reduction in fibrosis improves the efficacy of chemotherapy treatments.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

The association between type 2 diabetes and trabecular bone score (TBS) has not been clear. The present study sought to answer the specific question of whether patients with type 2 diabetes have a lower TBS than those without diabetes. Using electronic and manual search, we identified 12 studies that had examined the association between type 2 diabetes and TBS between 2013 and 2019. These studies involved 35,546 women and 4962 men aged 30 years and older. We extracted the mean and standard deviation of TBS for patients with and without diabetes. The synthesis of effect sizes was done by the random effects meta-analysis model. Patients with diabetes had significantly lower TBS than those without diabetes, with standardized mean difference being \u2212 0.31 (95% CI, \u2212 0.45 to \u2212 0.16).

There was heterogeneity between the studies, with the index of inconsistency (I 2) ranging from 92% (in women) to 69.5% (in men). Patients with type 2 diabetes have a lower TBS than non-diabetic individuals, suggesting that TBS can be a useful measurement for the assessment of fracture risk in diabetic patients.", "citation_paragraph": "There is a paradox in the relationship between diabetes, bone mineral density, and fracture. In the general population, individuals with a higher bone mineral density (BMD) have a lower risk of fragility fracture, such that each standard deviation increase in BMD is associated with approximately 50% reduction in fracture risk [1] . Patients with type 2 diabetes are known to have a higher BMD, but they have a higher risk of fragility fracture. The association between diabetes and fracture is particularly apparent for hip [2] and vertebral fracture [3] . This paradoxical relationship suggests that the etiology of fracture in diabetic patients is different from that of the general population.One of the etiologies of fracture is trabecular bone score (TBS), which can be considered an index of bone fragility. The measurement of TBS reflects the variance in trabecular bone component of the trabecular-rich lumbar spine, or a surrogate of bone microarchitecture [4] . Cross-section studies also found a correlation between TBS and HRpQCT [5] and MRI measures [6] . The dispersion of mineral content can be seen as a complementary measure of bone strength (in addition to bone mineral density). TBS can be derived from a lumbar spine BMD scan by determining the slope of the log-log transformation of the 2-D variogram, relating graylevel variance in dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) images [7] . Several studies have shown that lower values of TBS were associated with an increased risk of fragility fracture [8] , and more importantly, the association was independent of bone mineral density (BMD) and age [9] .Diabetes may be associated with altered bone microarchitecture. Under that hypothesis, it can be predicted that patients with type 2 diabetes have a lower TBS measurement. Indeed, several observational studies have reported that compared with those without diabetes, TBS was lower in diabetic patients [10] [11] [12] [13] . However, a number of studies found no statistically significant association between TBS and diabetes [14, 15] . The difference in findings between studies is expected because of-among others-the differences in population characteristics, sampling strategies, and data analytic techniques. The discrepancy in findings could also be attributable to the duration of diabetes, antidiabetic medication use, and HbA1c levels. In such a scenario, meta-analysis is an attractive approach to resolve conflicting evidence. The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that type 2 diabetes is associated with lower TBS by synthesizing all peer-reviewed published evidence regarding the difference in TBS between diabetes and non-diabetes individuals.", "citance": "In the general population, individuals with a higher bone mineral density (BMD) have a lower risk of fragility fracture, such that each standard deviation increase in BMD is associated with approximately 50% reduction in fracture risk [1] .", "claims": [{"text": "Individuals with a higher bone mineral density have a lower risk of fragility fracture.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Individuals with a higher bone mineral density have an increased risk for fragility fracture.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}

Vitamin D intake and serum levels of 25 (OH) Vitamin D were compared between MS patients and healthy individuals.  Materials and methods: In this case-control study, 168 MS patients (cases) and 168 age and sex-matched apparently healthy subjects (controls) were studied in East Azerbaijan province in Iran completed the study. A validated food frequency questionnaire was completed for each subject and serum 25 (OH) D levels were assessed using Chemiluminescence Competitive Immunoassay (CLIA).  Results: There were no significant differences in weekly frequency consumption of fats and oils between the groups. Weekly frequency consumption of beef, lamb, minced meat, cream cheese, dairy products (low-fat milk, yoghurt, ice cream (pasteurized and traditional ice cream), cream, drinking chocolate milk, milk fat and curd as well as hamburger, salami, sausage and fresh mushroom in MS patients were significantly less than healthy subjects (P < 0.05). Vitamin D deficiency (<10 ng/ml) in MS patients was significantly more common than the controls (P = 0.042).

Vitamin D deficiency as a risk factor for MS was first proposed over 40 years ago [29] [30] [31] . Colecalciferol (vitamin D3) is available from two sources: skin exposure to ultraviolet B radiation (UVB) in sunlight and consuming vitamin D-rich foods [32, 33] .The efficiency of vitamin D intake from foods is 40 -400 units in each serving while daily exposure to sunlight in summer for 15-20 min can provide approximately 10,000 units per minute [34] .Vitamin D intake depends on culture, age, sex, sunlight exposure, business, cloths and food pattern [35] [36] [37] . Vitamin D is available from dark and fatty fish (e.g., salmon), fortified foods (e.g., milk and juices) and vitamin supplements (Colecalciferol).In Japan, results of the study among pre-and post-menopausal women showed fish consumption more than 4 servings/week, increased concentration of 25 (OH) D significantly than the people who intake 1-3 servings/week [38] . Effect of nutrient in MS incidence was firstly proposed by Swank et al 60 years ago and reported that high intake of fat and margarine were associated with high incidence of MS in the studied population [35] . Fish consumption is high in Norway whereas MS incidence is lower than other countries with less fish consumption [39] . The results of a prospective study on 173 nurses, vitamin D intake was estimated from 1980-2000 using a comprehensive semi quantitative FFQ revealed that decreased in MS incidence parallel to increasing vitamin D intake (p = 0.03) and serum vitamin D concentration [40] . In another prospective study on 200,000 women in the USA, MS incidence was 41% lower among women who taking 400 IU/day or more from vitamin D supplements compared with those who did not take the supplements [41] . Although, it seems that dietary vitamin D intake varies in countries, consumption of vitamin D supplements (>400 IU/ day) is associated with a decrease in MS risk [32] . Moreover, findings of previous epidemiological studies have revealed an increased MS risk among individuals with low serum vitamin D concentrations [37] . However, a study in Iran failed to confirm any association between egg and fish intake with circulating 25 (OH) D level among MS patients [16] .In conclusion, the present study showed that consumption of vitamin D rich foods and serum vitamin D level in MS patient are lower than the healthy subjects and therefore, nutrition education and/ or vitamin D supplementation appears to be necessary.

Several regulatory links have been described between cell shape, cytoskeletal tension, matrix adhesiveness and stiffness, and recent studies have begun to uncover how these mechanotransduction pathways can impact transcriptional signaling and cell fate decision. The integrated mechanisms linking cell forces, form and fate are likely critical for driving normal morphogenesis, tissue development, and healing. Dysregulation of these mechanisms may also tip the scale from normal to diseased states. Here, we highlight mechanisms that alter cell shape and mechanics, and the pathways affected by these changes.", "citation_paragraph": "It has become increasingly evident that changes in cell shape and mechanics are critical drivers of cell signaling and function, yet the mechanisms by which structure and function are linked are only recently being uncovered. To identify mechanosensitive transcription pathways, Dupont et al. [39] performed a gene expression screen on cells plated atop varying matrix stiffnesses and identified YAP (Yes-associated protein) and TAZ (transcriptional activator with PDZ-binding motif) as key, differentially expressed factors, which localize to the nucleus with increased stiffness. One might speculate that actin polymerization levels modulate YAP/ TAZ shuttling and nuclear localization, similar to the MRTF (myocardin-related transcription factor)-regulation of SRF (serum response factor) (for review on transcriptional control of actin dynamics refer to [40] ). However, inhibition of Rho activity prevented YAP/TAZ nuclear localization while inhibiting F-actin polymerization did not. Thus YAP/TAZ only accumulates in the nucleus when the cell is actively able to generate tension, providing the first description of a transcriptional mechanism that appears to be dependent on force. As with the earlier studies on stiffness dependent lineage commitment [6, 41] , knockdown of YAP/TAZ activity on stiff surfaces increased adipogenic differentiation, while the depletion of YAP/TAZ on stiff surfaces prevented osteogenic differentiation. An analogous study, again based on differential whole genome gene expression datasets identified SRF as a cell shape-modulated transcriptional signal. While SRF activity can be regulated by RhoA via MRTFs [42, 43] , and cell spreading regulates RhoA [7, 44] , cell shapestimulated SRF activity was surprisingly independent of Rho-mediated cell tension. Instead, cell shape regulated SRF activity via the classical MAPK/TCF pathway. Spread cells (i.e. high adhesion) increased JNK activation, Sap-1 promoter binding, and SRFmediated transcription, while rounded cells (i.e. low adhesion) stimulated p38 dependent Net promoter binding and inhibition of transcription [45] .One more example of mechanoregulated transcription comes from studies of blood vessel formation, a concert of proliferation, migration and tube formation, requiring different levels of cytoskeletal organization and activity.GATA2 was found to act as a key Rho-mediated mechanosensitive regulator in endothelial cells, increasing VEGFR2 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2) expression, with increased activity on stiff matrices [46] (for a more in-depth review on mechanosensitive transcriptional factors refer to [47] ). While inhibition of Rho mediated tension in endothelial cells by binding transcription factor TFII-1, inhibits VEGFR2 expression. GATA2 and TFII-1 antagonize each other controlling the vessel formation [48] . The balance of stiffness sensing by GATA2 and VEGFR2 activity by TFII-1 allowed for the appropriate coordination of proliferation, migration and network formation both in in vitro and in vivo models.While much effort has focused on focal adhesions as a potential early mechanosensor that responds to changes in substrate stiffness and cell shape, the nucleoskeleton has recently been implicated as well. It was observed that cells on a soft matrix have a wrinkled nucleus, in contrast to cells on a stiff matrix which have a smoother, flattened appearance, and that this change resulted from a change in the expression of lamin-A, a class of intermediate filaments of the nucleoskeleton that stabilize the nucleus [49 ] (for review on lamins refer to [50] ). Cells residing in soft tissue depots expressed low levels of nuclear lamin-A in contrast to cells in stiffer tissues which expressed high levels of nuclear lamin-A. Importantly, directly changing lamin-A levels modulated the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. A possible mechanism for this effect is that Lamin-A interacts with nuclear actin to regulate SRF and also stabilizes YAP nuclear localization.On the horizon: dimensionality and dynamic regulation of cell shape and fate One limitation to the generalizability of these aforementioned systems is their use of flat culture substrates. While some cells are found on flat surfaces in the body, such as with epidermal and epithelial linings, many cells are surrounded by a 3-dimensional (3D) matrix (for review on 3D microenvironments refer to [51] ). Cells are not spread in stiff 3D matrices as they would be on stiff 2D substrates. Khetan et al. [52 ] encapsulated stem cells within hyaluronic acid hydrogels and subjected the matrix to sequential crosslinking with a degradable peptide. Sequential crosslinking directs cells to remain rounded, while in non-crosslinked gels cells become spread. When placed in bipotent media (1:1 mix of adipogenic to osteogenic media) rounded cells favored adipogenesis while spread favored osteogenesis. However, if crosslinking was delayed or when myosin activity was chemically inhibited cells remained spread and underwent adipogenesis. These results demonstrate that the relationship between matrix stiffness, cell shape, cytoskeleton tension, and differentiation signaling can be substantially more complex in a 3D environment.Importantly, while mechanotransduction studies have largely focused on maintaining uniform adhesive and mechanical conditions throughout a study, the dynamics of changes in cell adhesion, shape and mechanics could be important to how they impact cell function. One study has recently examined whether cells develop a 'memory' of their previous mechanical state [53 ] . Using a novel biomaterial system where substrate stiffness can be modulated over time, it was found that YAP activity persisted the longer a cell is cultured on a stiff matrix and biased mesenchymal stem cells towards osteogenesis. The longer a cell was on a stiff matrix before that matrix was softened led to a more elongated phenotype, while cells only experiencing a soft matrix were more rounded. More surprising was that YAP persisted on stiff matrices even after actin stress fibers were chemically abolished. These findings demonstrate a need to consider temporal control in understanding how these signals are interpreted.Although mechanotransduction studies have focused mainly on normal cell function, the field will inevitably need to address how these regulatory mechanisms contribute to abnormal phenotype in pathologic conditions. In fact, the field of clinical pathology is based on evaluation of the cell's shape, using morphology parameters as metrics. Therefore understanding cell shape not only in the context of morphogenesis and homeostasis but also of disease is of great interest. For example, in epidermal differentiation, cytoskeletal reorganization is a critical part of the process. Here, a loss of SRF leads to the inability of cytoskeletal reorganization to drive polarization, and as such cells cannot undergo division, differentiation and stratification [54] . In cutaneous wounding, cells undergo a shape change as they become more fibroproliferative when migrating to close the wound. Mechanical strain increases cytoskeletal tension through focal adhesions inducing a signaling cascade leading to inflammation and fibrosis. Inhibiting focal adhesion formation prevents cells from converting this mechanical signal into eventual scarring [55] . Cell shape dynamics have also been described in the cancer field, in the context of transitions that lead to extravasation from a tumor to metastasize at a secondary site. In one study, hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) directly regulated Rho activity, leading to increased cell motility via increased cytoskeletal reorganization, with a further increase when placed on stiffer substrates to mimic tumor stiffness [56] . Inhibition of focal adhesions or HIF activity blocked Rho-mediated cell motility. These illustrate the need to understand how the cell integrates signals to mediate cell shape dynamics (or cytoskeletal reorganization) to ultimately regulate pathological states [57] .", "citance": "Inhibiting focal adhesion formation prevents cells from converting this mechanical signal into eventual scarring [55] .", "claims": [{"text": "Inhibiting focal adhesion formation enables cells to convert mechanical strain into eventual scarring.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Inhibiting focal adhesion formation increases the rate at which cells convert mechanical strain into inflammation and fibrosis.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Inhibiting focal adhesion formation prevents cells from converting mechanical strain into eventual scarring.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Inhibiting focal adhesion formation prevents cells from converting mechanical strain into inflammation and fibrosis.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

The vast majority of patients with GBM will always develop tumor recurrence. The tumor\u2019s location, its unique feature of high motility, and its protection by the blood brain barrier make certain therapies that are effective for some other cancers ineffective against brain tumors. Overall, the 5-year survival rate is less than 10%, with a final mortality rate of close to 100 percent. The molecular mechanisms that underlie persistent tumorigenesis and treatment resistance are still poorly understood. A genome-wide expression profile analysis revealed that besides those genes associated with cell proliferation, inflammation, angiogenesis, and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, a series of genes linked with neuroepithelial stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, skeletal/cartilage development, morphogenesis, and organogenesis, were determined to be overexpressed when compared with normal brain tissue, implicating that a tissue regeneration/repair-like program is constantly activated in GBM tumors. A subset of GBM develops from lower-grade gliomas and can thus be clinically classified as \u2018\u2018secondary,\u2019\u2019 whereas some GBM occur with no prior evidence of a lower-grade tumor and can be clinically classified as \u2018\u2018primary.\u2019\u2019 Substantial genetic differences between these groups of GBM have been identified. Moreover, a molecular classification study indicated that both treatment-refractory and untreated primary GBM tumors are clustered in a group segregated from treated and untreated secondary GBM tumors, and supports the view that GBM subtypes may have derived from a distinct cell-oforigin, which is resistant to conventional therapy, therefore allowing for re-seeding tumor with molecular properties similar to untreated tumors. Thus, post-treatment tumor recurrence may mimic the scenario of post-injury tissue repair. Many adult tissues undergo renewal after injury, and hence require a new supply of cells originating from specialized tissue stem cells with the capability to undergo self-renewal and differentiation to repair damaged tissue. Recently, glioblastoma stem cells (GSC) or glioblastoma stem\u2013like cells (GSLC), a minor subpopulation within tumor mass, were isolated and characterized as tumor-initiating cells and were hypothesized to be responsible for post-treatment recurrence because of their enhanced radio-/chemo-resistant phenotype and ability to reconstitute the original tumor tissue when grafted into mice.

L1CAM expression was found to be preferentially higher in GSC compared to normal neural progenitors, and knockdown of L1CAM expression via shRNA interference can lead to the loss of sphereforming capacity, induced cell apoptosis, and suppressed tumor growth (113) . The induction of GSC apoptosis by decreasing the expression of L1CAM is suggested due to the decreased expression of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Olig2 and the increased expression of the p21WAF1/CIP1 tumor suppressor (113) . Correspondingly, it has been shown that an Olig2-regulated lineage-restricted pathway is critical for proliferation and maintenance of tumorigenic GSC through the suppression of p21WAF1/CIP1 (114) . Bmi1 plays an essential part in the self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and NSC (115) (116) (117) . Bmi1 is part of the Polycomb group gene family and a member of polycombrepressing complex 1 (PRC1), which is required to maintain the transcriptionally repressive state of many genes by chromatin remodeling and histone modification (118) (119) . It has been shown that Bmi-1 is highly expressed in CD133+ GSC and Bmi-1 knockdown resulted in inhibition of self-renewal capacity and induction of both cell apoptosis and cell differentiation, as well as loss of tumorigenic capacity (120) . Similarly, disruption of EZH2, the main component of PRC2, robustly impairs self-renewal and tumorigenic capacity of GSC (121) . This data thus suggest that PcG proteins are required for maintaining stemness, survival, and tumorigenic capacity of GSC.Integrins are one of the major families of cell adhesion receptors that cells use to both bind to and respond to the ECM (122) . Specifically, integrin 6 subunit is critical for the early development of the nervous system and has been shown to play a role in neuronal migration, neurite outgrowth, and axon guidance during olfactory development (123) . A recent study showed that GSC highly express integrin 6 and their interaction with laminin on endothelial cells directly regulates the tumorigenic capacity of GSC (124) . Targeting integrin 6 in GSCs inhibits self-renewal, proliferation, and tumor formation capacity (124) , indicating integrin 6 is an essential factor for maintaining GSC and can be potentially used as a cellular target for depletion of GSCs. Tumor necrosis factor, alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3) or A20, a zinc finger protein, is an NF-\u03baB-inducible gene. A20 can protect the cells from TNF-induced apoptosis by disrupting the recruitment of the death domain signaling molecules TRADD and RIP to the receptor signaling complex (125) . A novel anti-apoptotic mechanism of A20 was recently reported and showed that A20 blocks TNF-induced apoptosis through suppression of c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) by targeting apoptosis signal-regulating kinase1 (ASK1) (126) . A20 was overexpressed in clinical glioma tissue samples and correlates to clinical staging (127) . A recent study showed that GSC overexpress A20, relative to non-stem glioma cells, and this protects GSC from cell death (128) . Inhibiting A20 expression by shRNA (shRNA) decreased GSC growth and survival through mechanisms associated with decreased cell-cycle progression and decreased phosphorylation of NF-kappaB p65(RelA). By contrast, elevated levels of A20 in GSCs contributed to apoptotic resistance and were less susceptible to TNFalpha-induced cell death than matched non-stem glioma cells. A20 knockdown reduced the self-renewal ability of these cells and decreased tumorigenic potential of GSCs, thereby resulting in increased survival of mice bearing human glioma xenografts. Thus, A20 contributes to glioma maintenance likely through anti-apoptotic effects on GSC.", "citance": "A recent study showed that GSC overexpress A20, relative to non-stem glioma cells, and this protects GSC from cell death (128) .", "claims": [{"text": "Inhibition of TNFAIP3 expression protects Glioma stem cells from cell death.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Overexpression of TNFAIP3 protects Glioma stem cells from cell death.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Mammals have eight isoforms of PI3K, divided into three classes. The class I PI3Ks generate 3-phosphoinositide lipids, which directly activate signal transduction pathways. In addition to being frequently genetically activated in cancer, similar mutations in class I PI3Ks have now also been found in a human non-malignant overgrowth syndrome and a primary immune disorder that predisposes to lymphoma. The class II and class III PI3Ks are regulators of membrane traffic along the endocytic route, in endosomal recycling and autophagy, with an often indirect effect on cell signalling. Here, we summarize current knowledge of the different PI3K classes and isoforms, focusing on recently uncovered biological functions and the mechanisms by which these kinases are activated. Deeper insight into the PI3K isoforms will undoubtedly continue to contribute to a better understanding of fundamental cell biological processes and, ultimately, of human disease. Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are lipid kinases that generate 3-phosphoinositides, which govern cellular signal transduction and membrane trafficking. The PI3K family comprises three classes of enzymes, which include several isoforms and complexes; the myriad of cellular functions and means of regulation of these enzymes are now coming into focus.", "citation_paragraph": "A cellular 'self-eating' process that involves breaking down subcellular components (for example, protein and damaged organelles) through the lysosomal pathway in response to nutrient depletion or stress. it is characterized by membrane trafficking events that sequester cytoplasmic material in double-membrane structures, called autophagosomes, followed by degradation and recycling of cellular components by the lysosome. from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P 2 ) at the plasma membrane. PtdIns(3,4,5)P 3 production makes possible the recruitment of cytosolic, inactive AKT to the membrane through its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. This leads to phosphorylation and activation of AKT by the PH domain-containing kinase PDK1 and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) (in which the SIN1 component contains a PH domain). Active AKT then phosphorylates its substrates, which in most known cases leads to functional inactivation (illustrated by the blunt-ended line). However, activation downstream of AKT phosphorylation is also observed, for example, for endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Whereas PtdIns(3,4,5)P 3 localizes only to the plasma membrane, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P 2 ) generated from PtdIns(3,4,5)P 3 by the action of 5-phosphatases such as SHIP1 and/or SHIP2 is found both on the plasma membrane and in an early endosomal compartment to where it is being transferred via clathrin-mediated endocytosis 54 . Evidence is emerging [54] [55] [56] that, in this endosomal location, AKT2 is preferentially activated over AKT1 and AKT3, with endosomal AKT2 being able to phosphorylate certain substrates (such as glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2), but not forkhead box protein O (FOXO) transcription factors or TSC2) to which other isoforms have less access. It is not clear whether such AKT isoform substrate specificity also exists for AKT-mediated signalling at the plasma membrane. PtdIns(3,4,5)P 3 can also be converted into PtdIns(4,5)P 2 by the inositol lipid 3-phosphatase PTEN, which is a key regulator of the cellular levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P 3 .

G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits released by activated GPCRs activate this heterodimer and engage it with the plasma membrane 24 (Fig. 2) .Via their RBDs, all class I catalytic subunits also interact with membrane-bound small GTPases, namely, RAS (p110\u03b1, p110\u03b4 and p110\u03b3) and RAC1 or CDC42 (p110\u03b2) 25, 26 . Among the class IA PI3K isoforms, p110\u03b2 is unique in its capacity to additionally interact with G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits 27 and activated RAB5 (reF.28 ) -a key early endosome marker (Fig. 2) . Although G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits activate the catalytic potential of p110\u03b2, the role of RAB5 binding in regulating p110\u03b2 activation remains unclear 29 . This multitude of upstream signals makes the regulation of p110\u03b2 among the most complex of the class I PI3Ks, with several inputs possibly required for full activation (reviewed in reFs 13, 29 ). Below, we use the terminology PI3K\u03b1, PI3K\u03b2, PI3K\u03b3 and PI3K\u03b4 when referring to the heterodimeric class I PI3K complexes.Phosphoinositides generated by class I PI3Ks. Activated class I PI3Ks phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P 2 ) at the plasma membrane to generate the lipid second messenger phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P 3 ; also known as PIP 3 ), which is metabolized to phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P 2 ) by 5-phosphatases such as SHIP1 and/or SHIP2 (Fig. 2) . The inositol lipid 3-phosphatase PTEN is a key regulator of the cellular levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P 3 and PtdIns(3,4)P 2 , converting these lipids into PtdIns(4,5)P 2 and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P), respectively 30, 31 ( Fig. 2) . In addition to their catalytic activity, class I PI3K catalytic subunits have protein scaffolding functions. In this capacity, they function as adaptor proteins in the assembly of protein-protein complexes to regulate a range of biological functions that do not depend on PI3K catalytic activity (reviewed in reFs 8, 11, 32 ) . In this Review, we focus on the kinase-dependent functions of the class I PI3Ks, given that these could possibly be targeted by small-molecule pharmacological inhibitors to modulate aberrant PI3K activity (see below).There is emerging evidence that p85 subunits may also have functions independent of the catalytic p110 subunit, especially in cancer, in which they may occur free of p110 or acquire mutations that convert them into neomorphic proteins with new functionalities, such as activation of the JNK and ERK signalling pathways (reviewed in reFs [33] [34] [35] ).3-Phosphoinositide protein effectors. PtdIns(3,4,5)P 3 and PtdIns(3,4)P 2 interact with lipid-binding pleckstrin homology (PH) domains in a range of protein effectors to modulate their localization and/or activity. Wellestablished effectors include protein kinases (such as AKT and BTK), scaffolding proteins (such as GAB proteins) and regulators of monomeric GTPases, namely, some gTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) and guanine nucleotide exchange factors. These different effectors enable class I PI3Ks to regulate a broad range of biological activities, including nutrient sensing, cell cycle progression and cell migration [15] [16] [17] 36 (Fig. 2) .Although many class I PI3K protein effectors bind to both PtdIns(3,4,5)P 3 and PtdIns(3,4)P 2 , some selectively bind to PtdIns(3,4)P 2 and could control PtdIns(3,4)P 2 -selective signalling pathways 37, 38 . It will be of interest to determine whether and how class I PtdIns(3,4)P 2 -driven biology integrates with that of PtdIns(3,4)P 2 produced by the class II PI3Ks (see below).In a typical mammalian cell, it is estimated that around 10-30 and possibly even more proteins can directly bind to class I PI3K lipids [39] [40] [41] [42] . Non-PH-domainbased interactions of proteins with PtdIns(3,4,5)P 3 and/or PtdIns(3,4)P 2 have also been described, with an example of specific isoforms of the myosin motor proteins 43, 44 . This indicates that multiple additional class I PI3K-dependent effector pathways remain to be uncovered.AKT as a key 3-phosphoinositide protein effector. AKT is activated by PtdIns(3,4,5)P 3 -driven or PtdIns(3,4)P 2 -driven recruitment to the plasma membrane, where it undergoes phosphorylation on the conserved Thr308 (by PDK1) and Ser473 (by mTOr complex 2 (mTORC2)), leading to its activation 45 . The ease with which AKT activation can be monitored as a proxy for class I PI3K activation (using antibodies against the phosphorylated Ser473 and Thr308 activation sites) in part explains why a large focus thus far has been on class I PI3K-mediated signalling through this kinase. However, given the potential for the class I PI3K-generated lipids to engage with a broader diversity of effectors, it is not surprising that AKT is not always absolutely required for PI3K-driven output (reviewed in reF.", "citance": "The inositol lipid 3-phosphatase PTEN is a key regulator of the cellular levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P 3 and PtdIns(3,4)P 2 , converting these lipids into PtdIns(4,5)P 2 and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P), respectively 30, 31 ( Fig. 2) .", "claims": [{"text": "Inositol lipid 3-phosphatase PTEN  converts Ptdlns(3,4,5)P 3 into Ptdlns(4,5)P 2.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Inositol lipid 3-phosphatase PTEN converts Ptdlns(3,4)P 2 into phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate.

Once inside, they reproduce asexually in a (48-h cycle for falciparum) while also forming agglomerates of infected cells to avoid spleen clearance [41] . Eventually, some of the merozoites develop into gametocytes, the sexual form of the parasite, maturing inside the parasitophorous vacuole until released to the peripheral blood, waiting for another mosquito bite to propagate the disease [42] . Parasitaemia in symptomatic infected humans can range from 100 to more than 250,000 parasites per \u00b5l of blood (hyperparasitaemia) [43, 44] .When a female Anopheles mosquito bites an infected vertebrate host, it results in the ingestion of a certain number of gametocytes. Within 15 min, the midgut lumen environment triggers the gametocyte egress and differentiation into micro and macrogametes [45, 46] . The following fusion leads to diploid cells (zygote) that will undergo meiotic division resulting in motile ookinetes [45, 46] . The main goal of ookinetes is to physically traverse a thick (1-20 \u00b5m) chitin-based peritrophic membrane (PM) formed upon blood ingestion, and the midgut epithelium [47] [48] [49] . The midgut invasion is not pacific and leads to apoptosis of the invaded cells [50, 51] . After establishing itself at its basal side, a few parasites (less than ten in average) will develop into the oocyst form, concluding one of the most critical stages in whole life cycle (Fig. 1) [45, 46] .Mitotic divisions start occurring at this stage and ultimately sporozoites are formed. Upon egress from mature oocysts, sporozoites travel via the haemolymph and can be found throughout the mosquito haemocoel until some of them reach the salivary glands [45, 46, 52] . Less than 20 % of the sporozoites entering the haemocoel will establish themselves in the salivary gland with the remaining being eliminated [52] .Transmission of sporozoites occurs when the mosquito ejects saliva into the skin, probing for a blood vessel. Despite some mosquitoes can harbour as many as thousands of sporozoites in their salivary glands, only a small number are ejected from the salivary ducts [53, 54] . After their injection into the dermis, they will try to find and invade a hepatocyte as soon as possible before detection of the immune system and continue the cycle [55] .In summary, the main differences between the mosquito and humans stages are:\u2022 the mosquito the parasites are exclusively extracellular; \u2022 there are, on average, fewer parasites in the vector comparing to the human host (Fig. 1) [60] [61] [62] .", "citance": "Once inside, they reproduce asexually in a (48-h cycle for falciparum) while also forming agglomerates of infected cells to avoid spleen clearance [41] .", "claims": [{"text": "Inside the body, falciparum parasites form agglomerates of infected cells to avoid spleen clearance.

Only in the last few years, it has become increasingly clear that metformin exerts benign pleiotropic actions beyond its prescribed use and ongoing investigations focus on a putative beneficial impact of metformin on the kidney. Both acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), two major renal health issues, often result in the need for renal replacement therapy (dialysis or transplantation) with a high socio-economic impact for the patients. Unfortunately, to date, effective treatment directly targeting the kidney is lacking. Metformin has been shown to exert beneficial effects on the kidney in various clinical trials and experimental studies performed in divergent rodent models representing different types of renal diseases going from AKI to CKD. Despite growing evidence on metformin as a candidate drug for renal diseases, in-depth research is imperative to unravel the molecular signaling pathways responsible for metformin's renoprotective actions. This review will discuss the current state-of-the-art literature on clinical and preclinical data, and put forward potential cellular mechanisms and molecular pathways by which metformin ameliorates AKI/CKD.", "citation_paragraph": "In several clinical studies, metformin has been shown to improve survival of AKI and CKD patients. In a large cohort of over 25,000 patients with T2DM, Bell et al. [64] provided a reassuring message of the safety of metformin in patients with or without CKD, as mortality was not adversely affected by metformin use. Metformin did not increase the incidence of AKI, and survival rates were higher in patients with AKI previously treated with metformin [64] . In a retrospective cohort study, Stephen et al. [65] linked Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients data for all incident kidney transplants from 2001 until 2012, and national pharmacy claims. They found that survival was superior for all outcomes for recipients who filled metformin claims compared with those who filled non-metformin agent claims [65] . In an open cohort study of 469,688 T2DM patients, the relationship between a range of complications and antidiabetic therapy was analyzed. Severe kidney failure, including dialysis treatment, kidney transplant, and CKD stage 5, were among the five pre-specified key outcomes. Compared with non-use, metformin was associated with a significantly decreased risk of severe kidney failure, whereas sulfonylureas and insulin increased this risk [66] . In a recent systematic review involving 17 observational studies, metformin use appeared to be associated with reduced all-cause mortality in patients with CKD, congestive heart failure, and chronic liver disease [67] .Conversely, in a study of 616 patients, Hsu et al. [68] evaluated the effect of continuous metformin treatment on renal function in patients with T2DM and moderate CKD (eGFR 30-60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). They concluded that continuous metformin therapy was associated with a decline in renal function in patients with T2DM and moderate CKD [68] . However, as this was a retrospective study, the authors could not exclude putative confounding factors such as life-style, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, cumulative duration of exposure, and defined daily dose of metformin.These findings open perspectives for urgently needed large, long-term prospective randomized controlled trials that investigate the effect of metformin on renal function.", "citance": "Compared with non-use, metformin was associated with a significantly decreased risk of severe kidney failure, whereas sulfonylureas and insulin increased this risk [66] .", "claims": [{"text": "Insulin decreases risk of severe kidney failure.", "subject": "Insulin", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Insulin increases risk of severe kidney failure.", "subject": "Insulin", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Metformin significantly decreases risk of severe kidney failure.", "subject": "Metformin", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Metformin significantly raises the risk of severe kidney failure.", "subject": "Metformin", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Sulfonylureas decreases risk of severe kidney failure.", "subject": "Sulfonylureas", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Sulfonylureas increases risk of severe kidney failure.", "subject": "Sulfonylureas", "is_negation": false}]}

Sequelae of obesity, such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes, consistently rank among the top causes of death worldwide. The global prevalence of obesity highlights the urgency of understanding the mechanisms regulating hunger and satiety. Appetite, defined as the motivational drive to obtain food, is regulated by a complex neurocircuitry which integrates a variety of interoceptive signals to gauge nutritional state and guide appropriate levels of food\u2010seeking.

One key hormonal signal is leptin, which is produced by adipose tissue. Leptin levels are proportional to adipose energy reserves, and exogenous leptin suppresses feeding. Leptin restrains food intake through a diffuse network of targets, including stimulation of ARC POMC neurons [40] (which in turn inhibit AGRP neurons by an opioidergic mechanism [41] ). Leptin also dampens activity of mesoaccumbal dopamine neurons, which drive motivated behaviour including feeding [42, 43] . Leptin also engages inhibitory LHA neurons, which project to the ventral tegmental area, to inhibit food intake [44] . Leptin also suppresses food intake via NTS neurons [45] . The hormone amylin, which is secreted by the pancreas and by hypothalamic cells, acts synergistically with leptin to activate LHA neurons [46] .Ghrelin is a hormone secreted by the stomach, with levels peaking just before a meal and declining after feeding. Exogenous ghrelin promotes feeding. Ghrelin activates glutamatergic afferents onto AGRP neurons, driving AGRP neuron activity [2, 11, 13, 41] . Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is produced by intestinal enteroendocrine cells (and some NTS neurons). Like leptin, GLP-1 engages a network of targets, including NTS and ARC, to suppress food intake [47] . Peptide YY (PYY) is another anorectic hormone produced by enterondendocrine cells which restrains food intake. The dorsal raphe nucleus is a recently identified direct PYY target [31 ] . The pancreatic hormone insulin is a major regulator of metabolism, and exerts effects on appetite via ventral tegmental, and possibly arcuate, neurons [48] .Exogenous compounds can also affect appetite by engaging brain neurocircuitry. POMC neurons are activated by nicotine, providing a mechanism for the widely observed weight control effect of tobacco consumption [49] . On the other hand, cannabis mediates the 'munchies' by activating ARC POMC neurons via CB1 receptors [50] . Although POMC neuron activation typically suppresses appetite, in this case CB1 receptor activation drives release of the POMC cleavage product b-endorphin but not another cleavage product, a-melanocyte stimulating hormone [50] . The precise mechanisms require further investigation. Finally, ethanol drives hunger via activation of AGRP neurons [51] (Figure 2 ).", "citance": "The pancreatic hormone insulin is a major regulator of metabolism, and exerts effects on appetite via ventral tegmental, and possibly arcuate, neurons [48] .Exogenous compounds can also affect appetite by engaging brain neurocircuitry.", "claims": [{"text": "Insulin effects appetite via ventral tegmental neurons.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 17023582, "title": "Efficacy of Supplementation with B Vitamins for Stroke Prevention: A Network Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials", "abstract": "BACKGROUND Supplementation with B vitamins for stroke prevention has been evaluated over the years, but which combination of B vitamins is optimal for stroke prevention is unclear. We performed a network meta-analysis to assess the impact of different combinations of B vitamins on risk of stroke.   METHODS A total of 17 trials (86 393 patients) comparing 7 treatment strategies and placebo were included. A network meta-analysis combined all available direct and indirect treatment comparisons to evaluate the efficacy of B vitamin supplementation for all interventions.   RESULTS B vitamin supplementation was associated with reduced risk of stroke and cerebral hemorrhage. The risk of stroke was lower with folic acid plus vitamin B6 as compared with folic acid plus vitamin B12 and was lower with folic acid plus vitamin B6 plus vitamin B12 as compared with placebo or folic acid plus vitamin B12. The treatments ranked in order of efficacy for stroke, from higher to lower, were folic acid plus vitamin B6 > folic acid > folic acid plus vitamin B6 plus vitamin B12 > vitamin B6 plus vitamin B12 > niacin > vitamin B6 > placebo > folic acid plus vitamin B12.   CONCLUSIONS B vitamin supplementation was associated with reduced risk of stroke; different B vitamins and their combined treatments had different efficacy on stroke prevention. Folic acid plus vitamin B6 might be the optimal therapy for stroke prevention. Folic acid and vitamin B6 were both valuable for stroke prevention. The efficacy of vitamin B12 remains to be studied.", "citation_paragraph": "Although supplementation with B vitamins has been used for stroke prevention for a long time, the effects are still inconsistent and the comparisons of the effects of different B vitamin combinations were insufficient. We performed a standard meta-analysis to identify the impact of B vitamin supplementation on risk of stroke. Moreover, we used a network meta-analysis to estimate the optimal therapy for stroke prevention and the relationship between various combinations of B vitamin supplementation.According to fixed-and random-effects standard meta-analysis, we found B vitamin supplementation associated with reduced risk of stroke and cerebral hemorrhage. These results were consistent with the meta-analysis by Huang et al [33] , who demonstrated that B vitamin supplementation had a significant protective effect on stroke (RR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.82, 0.95). Gao et al [34] . found that B vitamin supplementation significantly reduced homocysteine levels, which could reduce the risk of stroke events. In contrast, a recent meta-analysis based on absolute and relative measures of association showed that B vitamin supplementation could not reduce the risk of stroke [35] . Albert et al [19] . found that B vitamin supplementation might increase the risk of stroke perhaps because of different efficacy among combinations of B vitamins. However, a comparison of the efficacy of the therapies was lacking. Network meta-analysis could be a suitable method to access the interaction between various B vitamin combinations. In our network meta-analysis of 17 randomized controlled trials involving 86 393 subjects with 3 847 stroke events, we identified the optimal therapy for stroke prevention by synthesizing outcomes in terms of the effects of B vitamin supplementation on stroke. According to the posterior probability of the Bayesian method, FA + VB6 was the top treatment among all combinations. Moreover, FA + VB6 was more efficacious than FA + VB12 and FA + VB6 + VB12 more efficacious than FA + VB12. FA + VB6 might be the optimal treatment for prevention of stroke. FA was ranked the second-best therapy; the efficacy was favorable when it was combined with VB6 but was inferior when combined with VB12. FA + VB6 + VB12 supplementation has been considered first-line treatment for stroke prevention in recent years. From our study, the efficacy may be due to the combination of FA + VB6. Thus, FA and VB6 are valuable for stroke prevention, and that of VB12 needs further investigation.FA has an important protective role in stroke [36] . FA supplementation could reduce the risk of stroke by 18% in primary prevention [37] . The intake of FA or VB6, largely derived from multiple vitamins and fortified breakfast cereals, was highly associated with reduced levels of homocysteine [38] . The risk of stroke increased by 59% with levels of homocysteine increased by 5 \u03bcmol/L [39] .Our study suggested that FA + VB12 ranked last in efficacy. Ebbing et al. demonstrated that the risk of cardiovascular diseases could not be reduced by lowering plasma total homocysteine concentration with FA + VB12 [17] . Other studies reported that plasma concentrations of FA and VB12 were inversely related to homocysteine levels, but the efficacy of FA + VB12 on stroke prevention was not clarified [40, 41] . Therefore, the efficacy of VB12 and its combinations on stroke prevention need to be further explored for clinical practice.Our network meta-analysis was innovative in that we incorporated both direct and indirect comparisons of different B vitamin interventions and used a Bayesian random-effects model. All available evidence was incorporated to more precisely assess the efficacy of different B vitamin interventions on stroke prevention. As well, B vitamin supplementation was divided into different treatments, which was more accurate and meaningful for clinical drug intervention than with standard meta-analysis. Our study included only randomized controlled trials with recent information concerning the effects of different B vitamin interventions on the risk of stroke.Our study contains some limitations. Despite a detailed search mechanism, we may have missed some data from unpublished studies, which might have affected our results. As well, we considered only the outcomes of interest in all eligible studies rather than the specific information for participants in different intervention groups in our network meta-analysis.", "citance": "The intake of FA or VB6, largely derived from multiple vitamins and fortified breakfast cereals, was highly associated with reduced levels of homocysteine [38] .", "claims": [{"text": "Intake of folic acid (FA) and vitamin B6 (VB6) increases levels of homocysteine.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Intake of folic acid (FA) and vitamin B6 (VB6) reduces levels of homocysteine.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Conclusion: These findings highlight the importance of considering the risk of IDO among patients who are prescribed minor tranquilizers.Suicidal behavior is a significant health problem and has a strong association with psychiatric disorders such as mood and anxiety disorders [1, 2] . Intentional drug overdose (IDO) is the most common form of hospital-treated deliberate self-harm [3, 4] . In general, psychotropic drugs, such as minor and major tranquilizers, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and barbiturates are over-represented in IDOs [5] [6] [7] , accounting for up to 80% of IDOs involving prescription drugs [8] . In Ireland, approximately 68% of all hospital-treated episodes of deliberate self-harm involve an IDO [3] , and, of these, minor tranquilizers (benzodiazepines) are present in approximately 43% of cases [9] . This percentage is three-times that recorded in England [4] , suggesting a particularly high risk for self-harm associated with this medication in Ireland and reflecting differences between the countries in terms of prescribing patterns and other sources of access to benzodiazepines.Few studies, particularly in recent years, have focused on the source of medications taken in IDO acts. It has been consistently indicated that overdose patients primarily take their own medication in IDOs [5, 10, 11] . In addition, individuals who engage in IDOs are more likely to be depressed and to have previously engaged in selfharm compared with other self-harm patients who do not engage in IDOs [1, 10, 12] . While not all studies distinguish between types of prescribed medication in cases of IDO, factors such as single and multiple psychotropic drug use and repeat prescribing are identified as being strongly associated with repeat overdoses [12] . While psychotropic drugs have an established efficacy in treating psychiatric conditions, there is evidence of a link between increased prescribing rates and increased use in IDOs [13] .Restricting access to means has been shown to be one of the most effective strategies in both self-harm and suicide prevention [14] . In Ireland, in 2006, the withdrawal of Distalgesic (a prescription-only compound of paracetamol) resulted in an 84% reduction in the rate of IDO presentations to hospital emergency departments (EDs) involving Distalgesic compared with the previous 3 years before it was withdrawn [15] , without a significant substitution effect. Similar findings were observed in England and Wales in the 6 years following the withdrawal of coproxamol from the market [16] . Based on a comparative study including data on intentional paracetamol overdoses in the UK and Ireland, an association was found between paracetamol pack sizes and the number of tablets involved in overdoses [17] .Knowing the extent to which patients who present to hospital EDs as a result of IDO have taken their prescribed medications in the act should inform preventive initiatives. If this is rare, then the focus should be placed on the availability of over-the-counter medicines, however, if this is common, then the revision of prescribing practices and other measures aimed at reducing access to relevant prescribed medications should be considered. Within this context, the present study aims to investigate the proportion of IDO patients with current prescriptions and the proportion of those that used their medicines in overdose acts, as well as factors associated with these patients.", "citance": "Similar findings were observed in England and Wales in the 6 years following the withdrawal of coproxamol from the market [16] .", "claims": [{"text": "Intentional drug overdose presentations in hospital emergency departments in England and Wales increased during the 6 years following withdrawal of Distalgesic from the market.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Intentional drug overdose presentations in hospital emergency departments in England and Wales were reduced during the 6 years following withdrawal of Distalgesic from the market.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Post mortem studies have shown that injury patterns correlate with inflammatory infiltrates in the brain, which [1] suggests that inflammation and innate neuronal subtype susceptibility to injury are important determinants of disease. The ISGs Irf1, Irg1, Ifi27, and Rsad2 were shown to inhibit WNV replication in cortical neurons, and they were more highly expressed in the cerebellum compared with the cortex of mice [14] . In this patient, we also show that expression of Irf1, Ifi27, and Rsad2, in addition to Stat1, Oas1, and Ifit1, are regionally heterogeneous, with the high levels generally found in the subcortical regions of the brain. Thus, it may be that regional differences in ISG expression may contribute to the regional patterns of neuronal injury.Our data on region-specific patterns of WNV genetic diversity further suggest that WNV encounters different selective pressures as it spreads throughout brain. As with injury, the regional differences in immune responses and susceptibility of neuronal subtypes may contribute to the strength of selection as represented by increased amino acid substitutions in the viral genomes. For example, WNV populations in the thalamus exhibited an increased frequency of amino acid substitutions when compared with the cortex, suggesting an association between increased ISG expression and selection in the CNS. Although consensus amino acid differences between the WNV populations of the cortex and the thalamus were minimal, an expanding body of evidence demonstrates that minority variants may directly and significantly influence WNV phenotype [5, 15, 16] .This study has several limitations. This work is from a single patient; therefore, the findings are hypothesis generating and need to be verified in experimental models. However, the confluence of human clinical data and timely acquisition and analysis of human brain tissue is difficult to complete for this sporadic infection. In this 1 host, we used NGS to show evidence of intraregional variation in viral populations and ISG expression. However, other hosts with different ISG patterns may exhibit different regional genetic variation. Thus, further studies of minority WNV variants and immune activation in the human CNS will be needed to identify mechanisms of viral selection that are associated with injury and disease.", "citance": "The ISGs Irf1, Irg1, Ifi27, and Rsad2 were shown to inhibit WNV replication in cortical neurons, and they were more highly expressed in the cerebellum compared with the cortex of mice [14] .", "claims": [{"text": "Interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) Irf1, Irg1, Ifi27, and Rsad2 are more expressed in the cerebellum than the cortex of mice.", "subject": "Interferon stimulated genes (ISGs)", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) Irf1, Irg1, Ifi27, and Rsad2 are more expressed in the cortex than the cerebellum of mice.", "subject": "Interferon stimulated genes (ISGs)", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) Irf1, Irg1, Ifi27, and Rsad2 encourage West Nile virus replication in cortical neurons.", "subject": "Interferon stimulated genes (ISGs)", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) Irf1, Irg1, Ifi27, and Rsad2 inhibit West Nile virus replication in cortical neurons.", "subject": "Interferon stimulated genes (ISGs)", "is_negation": false}]}

However, the role of IL-18 and HMGB1 in the modulation of the valvular interstitial cell (VIC) phenotype remains unclear. We hypothesized that HMGB1 mediates IL-18-induced myofibroblastic transition of VICs. Methods: The expression of IL-18, HMGB1 and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) in human aortic valves was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining, real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting. Plasma concentrations of IL-18 and HMGB1 were measured using the ELISA kit. Cultured human aortic VICs were used as an in vitro model. Results: Immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting revealed increased levels of IL-18, HMGB1 and \u03b1-SMA in calcific valves. Circulating IL-18 and HMGB1 levels were also higher in CAVD patients. In vitro, IL-18 induced upregulation of HMGB1 and \u03b1-SMA in VICs. Moreover, IL-18 induced secretion of HMGB1 to the extracellular space and activation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB). Blockade of NF-\u03baB abrogated the upregulation and release of HMGB1 induced by IL-18. Whereas HMGB1 inhibition attenuated the IL-18-induced expression of \u03b1-SMA, HMGB1 enhanced the effect of IL-18. Conclusions: We demonstrated for the first time that both tissue and plasma levels of IL-18 and HMGB1 were increased in patients with CAVD. Mechanically, HMGB1 mediated IL-18-induced VIC myofibroblastic transition.", "citation_paragraph": "have valvular sclerosis [1] . CAVD encompasses a wide clinical continuum from AV fibrosis and sclerosis to severe aortic stenosis.Valvular interstitial cells (VICs), the most abundant cell type in human valves, play a critical role in normal valve structure and function. In cases of valve diseases, chronic stresses are thought to result in prolonged activation of VICs, which differentiate to become myofibroblasts as well as osteoblast-like cells [2] . Over time, chronic activation of VICs likely leads to increased fibrosis of the valve leaflets and the formation of bone-like calcified nodules. These effects have catastrophic effects on the mechanical flexibility of the leaflets and compromise valve function.Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a member of the IL-1 family of cytokines and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis [3] . IL-18 also induces cardiac fibroblast migration and differentiation to myofibroblasts [4] . A previous study demonstrated that IL-18 and IL-18 receptor alpha are more highly expressed in nonrheumatic human stenotic AVs [5] . High mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), one of the most important damageassociated molecular patterns, is released from cells following the formation and activation of inflammasome [6] . In our previous study, HMGB1 was demonstrated to promote the osteogenic differentiation and calcification of VICs [7] .

Little is known about the link between PAD, cognitive function, and whether exercise might reduce cognitive dysfunction in PAD patients, as previously observed concerning both quality of life and prognosis. This review highlights the fact that patients suffering from PAD often demonstrate cognitive dysfunction characterized by reduced performance in nonverbal reasoning, reduced verbal \ufb02uency, and decreased information processing speed and a greater risk for progression toward dementia. Further, the data presented support that physical exercise, likely through myokine secretion and microglial anti-inflammatory phenotype enhancement, might participate in the cognition protection in common clinical settings.", "citation_paragraph": "Studies have shown that anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1RA, and IL-10, are increased after exercise. Physical exercise also induces the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA in the hippocampus, an important factor responsible for neuron survival, maturation, proliferation, and plasticity, thus playing a significant role in learning and memory [46, 47] .Moon et al. [48] suggested that cathepsin-B may be an important mediator of the effects of physical exercise on cognition. After 12 weeks of exercise, cathepsin-B levels increased in mice plasma and muscle, and the cathepsin-B treatment in neuronal cells increased BDNF expression. Further, cathepsin-B knockout mice showed no improvement in neurogenesis and spatial memory, as compared to control mice. Importantly, similar results were found in rhesus monkey and humans, correlating the increase of cathepsin-B plasma levels with cognition improvement [48] .Irisin appears also as an exercise-induced myokine, released upon the cleavage of the membrane-bound precursor protein fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5). It is associated with homeostasis processes such as glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and fat browning [49] . Recently, irisin demonstrated an important role as a neurotrophic factor promoting survival, maintenance, and function of neuronal cells [50] . Wang et al. [51] , showed that irisin protected the neurons, reduced the release of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6, and reduced the expression of cyclooxygenase 2 (proinflammatory factor) in cultured astrocytes exposed to \u03b2-amyloid. Accordingly, Lourenco et al. [52] showed that an intra-cerebroventricular infusion of amyloid-\u03b2 oligomers (A\u03b2Os) induced significant reductions of FNDC5 mRNA expression in mice hippocampus. Similarly, impaired maintenance of hippocampal long-term potentiation and memory were observed in knocked down FNDC5/irisin mice. However, when A\u03b2Os mice received an intravenous injection of FNDC5, hippocampus FNDC5 levels increased and memory was protected. Reduced levels of FNDC5/irisin in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid in patients with Alzheimer's disease further support the implication of such defective signaling in humans.Concerning exercise/irisin relationships, some controversies still exist. Physical exercise protected A\u03b2Os mice from cognitive dysfunction and increased the hippocampal levels of FNDC5/irisin, as compared to sedentary mice [52] . Consistently, mice performing physical exercise for 2 weeks prior to cerebral ischemia demonstrated better scores on a neurological function test. Further supporting the neuroprotective effects of irisin, such beneficial effects of physical exercise were abolished when blocking irisin one hour before cerebral ischemia [53] .However, since the original study by Bostrom et al. showing that exercise increases irisin in mice and humans [54] , others proposed negative evidence of a possible expression and concentrations of irisin in skeletal muscles and serum during exercise or training [55, 56] and the physiological role of FNDC5/irisin in mediating responses to exercise was challenged [57] . Nonetheless, several publications supported exercise-related changes in irisin [58] . For example, an exercise-related increase in irisin resulted in BDNF expression in the hippocampus [59] and K\u00fcster et al. [60] observed a positive correlation between irisin, BDNF levels, and cognition in older adults at risk of dementia after 10 weeks of physical exercise. Accordingly, physical exercise-induced cognitive improvement together with increased neurogenesis and BDNF, FNDC5 levels, and synaptic proteins in the hippocampus of 5XFAD transgenic mice, a model for Alzheimer's disease [61] . It is therefore likely that the high expression of the irisin precursor FNDC5 in the brain, including in the cerebellar Purkinje cells, the hypothalamus and hippocampus might participate in the beneficial effects of exercise on brain and neurodegenerative diseases [62] .The type of exercise might modulate irisin /brain interactions. Irisin appeared to not be involved in resistance training because it failed to activate PGC-1\u03b11, a transcription regulator upstream of the FNDC5 [62] . The timing of blood withdrawal might also be essential since elevated irisin has been shown to be transient during exercise in young men and women [63] . This might also explain some discrepant data previously reported [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] . Ongoing identification of irisin receptors and detailed signaling pathways triggered during exercise will be useful to increase our knowledge and allow us to optimize irisin activity modulation.Interleukin 6 (IL-6) has been described as a double-edged sword, which may present proor anti-inflammatory effects, and consequently neurodegenerative or protective actions [64, 65] . Mainly defined as a proinflammatory cytokine, IL-6 was the first myokine found to be secreted into the bloodstream in response to muscle contractions, with a considerable increase in plasma up to 100-fold in response to exercise [66, 67] .The role of IL-6 in the brain is rather complex. IL-6 differentially influences microglia, mediating neuroprotective [68] and neurotoxic microglial responses [69] . It exerts neurotrophic actions and is also a mediator of acute inflammation [70] . A number of studies have reported elevated levels of IL-6 during central nervous system (CNS) disorders [65] , but on the other hand Ma and co-workers [71] , demonstrated that IL-6 reduced neuronal cytosolic Ca 2+ overload, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and neuronal induced by NMDA, demonstrating that IL-6 has a neuroprotective property. Similarly, the IFN-\u03b3 and IL-6 in an acute neuro-inflammatory environment are neuroprotective via ERK and/or STAT3 [72] . Gmiat et al. found that a single bout of high-intensity circuit training was able to improve concentration and spatial memory in young women, and that irisin and IL-6 releases from exercise (respecting intensity and periods of adequate rest and nutrition) might be considered as a sensor stimulating BDNF synthesis [73] . Starkie et al. demonstrated that exercise and IL-6 infusion inhibit TNF-\u03b1 production, suggesting that IL-6 might mediate anti-inflammatory activity during exercise [74] .Myostatin, another important myokine, is a member of the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily, and its inactivation induces skeletal muscle hypertrophy in mice and humans. Myostatin also regulates the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis and modulation of adipose tissue function and mass [75] [76] [77] . Myostatin could be expressed in different brain regions, but its function in the brain is still unknown [75] . Interestingly, Lin et al. [78] demonstrated that myostatin levels were elevated in the gastrocnemius muscle and that the extent of muscle mass loss was associated with the severity of cognitive deficits in transgenic mice mimicking Alzheimer's disease. Myostatin knockdown in the gastrocnemius increased grip strength and muscle mass and improved memory in such transgenic mice. The authors concluded that cognitive dysfunction may be mediated or triggered by myostatin expression and suggested that myokine modulation may be a therapeutic intervention against muscular and cerebral dysfunctions (Figure 3) .

{"s2orc_id": 3950367, "title": "Targeting the IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signalling axis in cancer", "abstract": "The IL-6/JAK/STAT3 pathway is aberrantly hyperactivated in many types of cancer, and such hyperactivation is generally associated with a poor clinical prognosis. In the tumour microenvironment, IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signalling acts to drive the proliferation, survival, invasiveness, and metastasis of tumour cells, while strongly suppressing the antitumour immune response. Thus, treatments that target the IL-6/JAK/STAT3 pathway in patients with cancer are poised to provide therapeutic benefit by directly inhibiting tumour cell growth and by stimulating antitumour immunity. Agents targeting IL-6, the IL-6 receptor, or JAKs have already received FDA approval for the treatment of inflammatory conditions or myeloproliferative neoplasms and for the management of certain adverse effects of chimeric antigen receptor T cells, and are being further evaluated in patients with haematopoietic malignancies and in those with solid tumours. Novel inhibitors of the IL-6/JAK/STAT3 pathway, including STAT3-selective inhibitors, are currently in development. Herein, we review the role of IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signalling in the tumour microenvironment and the status of preclinical and clinical investigations of agents targeting this pathway. We also discuss the potential of combining IL-6/JAK/STAT3 inhibitors with currently approved therapeutic agents directed against immune-checkpoint inhibitors.", "citation_paragraph": "STAT3 has established tumourpromoting properties, is overexpressed and/or hyperactivated in the majority of human cancers, and is commonly associated with a poor prognosis; therefore, considerable effort has gone into identifying and developing STAT3 inhibitors that can be applied in the clinic. However, given the status of STAT3 as an intracellular transcription factor that, therefore, lacks enzymatic activity, it has often been considered an 'undruggable' target, and the development of possible inhibitors has been difficult 204 . Nonetheless, several compounds that Siltuximab, sirukumab, olokizumab, clazakizumab, and MEDI5117 are anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibodies. Tocilizumab and sarilumab are monoclonal antibodies that target IL-6R. These antibodies inhibit both the classic and trans-signalling pathways. By contrast, the gp130-Fc fusion protein olamkicept inhibits IL-6 trans-signalling but not the classic signalling pathway. Tofacitinib, ruxolitinib, pacritinib, and AZD1480 are small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target JAKs, preventing phosphorylation of STAT3. C188-9, OPB-31121, OPB-51602, and other Src homology domain 2 (SH2) domain inhibitors interfere with STAT3 dimerization. The STAT3 antisense oligonucleotide AZD9150 binds to and causes the destruction of STAT3 mRNA, thus decreasing STAT3 expression. The cyclic STAT3 decoy contains a nucleotide sequence derived from the promoter of the STAT3 target gene FOS. This decoy competitively inhibits STAT3 binding to genomic response elements in the promoter regions of target genes.inhibit either the function or expression of STAT3 have now reached clinical trials (FIG. 3; TABLE 2 ).The first direct inhibitors of STAT3 to be developed were based on tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides (PY*LKTK) and peptidomimetics (ISS-610, PM-73G), which are capable of binding to the SH2 domain of STAT3, and disrupt STAT3 dimerization and DNAbinding activity [205] [206] [207] [208] . These agents have demonstrated pro-apoptotic and antitumour activity against cancer cells with STAT3 hyperactivation, although they are limited in potency, cellular uptake, stability, and potential immunogenicity and have primarily been used as research tools. A number of non-peptide SH2 domain inhibitors have also been identified and have been shown to inhibit the growth of cells and/or tumours with elevated levels of activated STAT3, including STA-21, LLL-3, STATTIC, WP1066, S3I-201, BP-1-102, STX-0119, and HJC0123 (REFS [209] [210] [211] [212] [213] [214] [215] [216] [217] [218] [219] [220] [221] ).Of these compounds, BP-1-102, STX-0119, and HJC0123 are orally bioavailable in preclinical models.The nonpeptide STAT3-SH2 domain antagonists OPB-31121, OPB-51602, and C188-9 have all been evaluated in early phase clinical trials [222] [223] [224] [225] [226] [227] [228] [229] [230] . Phase I studies exploring the safety and tolerability of orally administered OPB-31121 in patients with hepato cellular carcinoma or other advanced-stage solid tumours have been completed, and maximum-tolerated doses have been established [225] [226] [227] . Evidence of antitumour activity was reported by Oh et al. 226 , although peripheral sensory neuropathy was observed in the study conducted by Okusaka et al. 227 . OPB-51602 can also be orally administered and has been evaluated in phase I studies involving patients with relapsed and/or refractory haema tological malignancies and treatmentrefractory solid tumours 228, 229 . Possible antitumour activity was seen in patients with NSCLC, although both studies revealed tolerability-related difficulties, including peripheral neuropathy and drug-induced pneumonitis. C188-9 is a high-affinity STAT3 inhibitor (K d ~5 nM) that can also be orally administered. It inhibits the growth of radioresistant head-and-neck cancer xenografts and is currently being evaluated in a phase I study involving patients with advanced-stage solid tumours 230 . An alternative method of inhibiting STAT3 function involves competitive inhibition of the inter actions between STAT3 and promoter elements in target genes. A 15-bp double-stranded decoy oligonucleotide corresponding to the STAT3 response element in the FOS promoter has been shown to competitively inhibit STAT3 binding to DNA and to suppress the tumour growth of preclinical models of brain, breast, head-and-neck, lung, ovarian, and skin cancers as well as AML 129, [231] [232] [233] [234] [235] [236] [237] . A phase 0 study involving intratumoural injection of this linear STAT3 decoy oligonucleotide in patients with head-and-neck cancer has demonstrated downregulation of STAT3 target genes 238 . A cyclic version of the STAT3 decoy has subsequently been generated 238 . The cyclic STAT3 decoy has increased heat and nuclease resistance, antitumour activity against xenograft tumour models following intravenous administration, and no apparent toxicities when administered at high doses 238, 239 . Inhibition of STAT3 expression using antisense oligonucleotides provides another distinctly different approach to inhibition of cellular STAT3 activity. AZD9150 is a second-generation STAT3 antisense oligo nucleotide that is optimized from previous iterations by incorporating 2\u0374\u22124\u0374 constrained ethyl-modified residues 240 . Preclinical testing has revealed a lack of end-organ damage and other adverse events following AZD9150 administration 241 . Notably, intravenous delivery of AZD9150 has been shown to inhibit the growth of lymphoma and NSCLC xenografts and to increase the sensitivity of cell-line models of neuroblastoma to cisplatin 240, 242 . Moreover, clinical evaluations of AZD9150 have revealed activity against treatment-refractory lymphoma and NSCLC, with a maximum-tolerated dose of 3 mg/kg (REF. 240 ). The major toxicities associated with AZD9150 in previous studies proved modest and primarily involved rapid induction of thrombocytopenia in two of the nine patients treated with 4 mg/kg doses. The generally favourable safety profile and preliminary evidence suggesting efficacy in patients support the further evaluation of AZD9150 in clinical trials. A further challenge facing the clinical implementation of both AZD9150 and the cyclic STAT3 decoy involves the delivery of nucleotide-based agents owing to the high molecular weight of both molecules.", "citance": "Notably, intravenous delivery of AZD9150 has been shown to inhibit the growth of lymphoma and NSCLC xenografts and to increase the sensitivity of cell-line models of neuroblastoma to cisplatin 240, 242 .", "claims": [{"text": "Intravenous delivery of AZD9150 encourages the growth of lymphoma.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Intravenous delivery of AZD9150 inhibits the growth of lymphoma.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 864939, "title": "Chocolate and Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease: A Systematic Review", "abstract": "BackgroundConsumption of chocolate has been often hypothesized to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) due to chocolate's high levels of stearic acid and antioxidant flavonoids. However, debate still lingers regarding the true long term beneficial cardiovascular effects of chocolate overall.MethodsWe reviewed English-language MEDLINE publications from 1966 through January 2005 for experimental, observational, and clinical studies of relations between cocoa, cacao, chocolate, stearic acid, flavonoids (including flavonols, flavanols, catechins, epicatechins, and procynadins) and the risk of cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke). A total of 136 publications were selected based on relevance, and quality of design and methods. An updated meta-analysis of flavonoid intake and CHD mortality was also conducted.ResultsThe body of short-term randomized feeding trials suggests cocoa and chocolate may exert beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk via effects on lowering blood pressure, anti-inflammation, anti-platelet function, higher HDL, decreased LDL oxidation. Additionally, a large body of trials of stearic acid suggests it is indeed cholesterol-neutral. However, epidemiologic studies of serum and dietary stearic acid are inconclusive due to many methodologic limitations. Meanwhile, the large body of prospective studies of flavonoids suggests the flavonoid content of chocolate may reduce risk of cardiovascular mortality. Our updated meta-analysis indicates that intake of flavonoids may lower risk of CHD mortality, RR = 0.81 (95% CI: 0.71\u20130.92) comparing highest and lowest tertiles.ConclusionMultiple lines of evidence from laboratory experiments and randomized trials suggest stearic acid may be neutral, while flavonoids are likely protective against CHD mortality. The highest priority now is to conduct larger randomized trials to definitively investigate the impact of chocolate consumption on long-term cardiovascular outcomes.", "citation_paragraph": "Mechanistic studies involving stearic acid and flavonoids have only assessed effects on intermediate cardiovascular endpoints. However, one cannot always assume effects from short term trials effects will necessarily translate into long term effects on CVD outcomes. Therefore, one needs to examine observational studies followed to CVD events. While one small study found moderate consumption of candy and chocolate was associated with lower all-cause mortality [120] , this analysis neither isolates chocolate nor CVD events. Thus, in absence of specific studies of chocolate flavonoids and risk of CVD, studies of all flavonoids are the best available evidence to infer risk.The prospective studies of flavonoids and risk of CVD are summarized in Table 3 . The earliest international ecologic study suggested flavonoid intake may be associated with lower rates of CHD mortality [121] . While some studies report flavonoid intake is not associated with CHD incidence [122] [123] [124] , two other prospective studies suggested flavonoids may lower risk of MI [125, 126] . For stroke, the evidence is fairly consistent. Other than one small early study which found a significantly lower risk of stroke with higher total flavonoid intake [127] , most studies indicated no association for risk of stroke [124, [128] [129] [130] . However, most of these studies had insufficient power to adequately study stroke, nor enough power to stratify on various subtypes of stroke with different etiologies.However, the most extensively consistent finding is the association between flavonoid intake and CHD mortality. A total of eight cohort studies found risk of lower CHD mortality with total or specific flavonoid intake [71, 121, 123, 125, 126, 128, [130] [131] [132] , with one study finding marginally protective association among men with prior CVD conditions [123] . Only one study reported absolutely no association between flavonoid intake and CHD mortality [133] . However, as noted by the authors of one of the studies, a high background consumption of milk with tea intake may have led to the null finding [133] , since milk intake has been shown to prevent the intestinal absorption of flavonoids [76] .A meta-analysis of the 7 prospective studies prior to September 2001 found that, overall, flavonoids may be protective against CHD mortality [17] . However, this metaanalysis did not include a large subsequent cohort study of 38,445 women [124] , which found a non-significant inverse association between flavonoid intake and CHD mortality. However, results from our updated meta-analysis still indicate a significant protective association exists between flavonoid intake and risk of CHD mortality, RR = 0.81 (95% CI: 0.71-0.92), comparing highest vs. lowest tertiles.However, a limitation of inference exists in that flavonoids consists of a wide variety of polyphenol compounds, the variety of which may differ between studies due to varying sources of dietary flavonoids. Nonetheless, dark chocolate does contain substantially more flavanols than tea, apple, onions, and red wine [12] . Additionally, chocolate has all the flavonoids of tea [134] , has 4 times the catechins of tea [134] , has many flavonoids not found in tea [135] , and substantially contributes to the total flavonoid intake in the diet of many countries [136] . However, inference from observational studies on the protective effect of flavonoids in chocolate on CVD risk is somewhat indirect and may need to be examined by further studies.Overall, these epidemiologic findings, combined with the large body of evidence from short term randomized chocolate feeding trials, suggests flavonoid intake from chocolate is likely protective against CVD, particularly CHD mortality. Additionally, given that dark chocolate has substantially higher levels of flavonoids than milk chocolate, and that milk may inhibit absorption of flavonoids -it would be more prudent to consume high flavonoid dark chocolate rather than milk chocolate.", "citance": "While one small study found moderate consumption of candy and chocolate was associated with lower all-cause mortality [120] , this analysis neither isolates chocolate nor CVD events.", "claims": [{"text": "It is not proven that moderate consumption of candy and chocolate reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) specifically.", "subject": "cardiovascular disease (CVD) ", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Moderate consumption of candy and chocolate reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).", "subject": "cardiovascular disease (CVD) ", "is_negation": true}]}
{"s2orc_id": 51892989, "title": "PHD3 Regulates p53 Protein Stability by Hydroxylating Proline 359", "abstract": "Cellular p53 protein levels are regulated by a ubiquitination/de-ubiquitination cycle that can target the protein for proteasomal destruction. The ubiquitination reaction is catalyzed by a multitude of ligases, whereas the removal of ubiquitin chains is mediated by two deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), USP7 (HAUSP) and USP10. Here, we show that PHD3 hydroxylates p53 at proline 359, a residue that is in the p53-DUB binding domain. Hydroxylation of p53 upon proline 359 regulates its interaction with USP7 and USP10, and its inhibition decreases the association of p53 with USP7/USP10, increases p53 ubiquitination, and rapidly reduces p53 protein levels independently of mRNA expression. Our results show that p53 is a PHD3 substrate and that hydroxylation by PHD3 regulates p53 protein stability through modulation of ubiquitination.", "citation_paragraph": "p53 is a potent tumor suppressor that functions as a stress-activated transcription factor regulating a multitude of cellular responses including apoptosis, senescence, DNA repair, and cell cycle arrest (el-Deiry et al., 1993; Levine, 1997; Li et al., 2012; Warboys et al., 2014) . Oxygen deprivation or hypoxia is among the stresses that have been shown to induce p53 signaling leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The induction of p53 signaling appears to be dependent on the severity and duration of the oxygen deprivation (Alarc\u00f3 n et al., 1999; Graeber et al., 1994; Hammond and Giaccia, 2005; Koumenis et al., 2001) . In addition to these dynamic regulations, in some cellular systems hypoxia has the diametrically opposed effect and decreases p53 protein levels (Chen et al., 2010; Sermeus et al., 2013) . The reason why p53 responds to hypoxia in such a variable fashion is not yet resolved, and the same pathways have been used to explain both why p53 activity is induced or reduced by hypoxia. p53 activity, localization, and stability are tightly regulated by a variety of post-translational modifications including ubiquitination, acetylation, phosphorylation, and hydroxylation (Bode and Dong, 2004; Wang et al., 2014) . Protein stability, as well as localization, are regulated by mono-and poly-ubiquitination mediated by ubiquitin ligases. Depending upon the cellular context, a variety of E3 ligases are thought to be the rate-liming factors in the regulation of p53 protein expression. One of these, MDM2, is regarded as the master regulator not only of p53 protein levels but also of p53 localization in a variety of cellular systems (Michael and Oren, 2003) . Additionally, in cells infected with human papilloma virus (HPV), the viral E6 protein promotes the binding of p53 to the E3-ligase E6AP, which in turn ubiquitinates p53 efficiently and severely reduces cellular p53 protein levels (Talis et al., 1998) .Ubiquitination levels are not exclusively controlled by the forward reaction of the ligases. The modification is reversible and p53 is deubiquitinated by a family of proteases, the deubiquitinases (DUBs), two of which, USP7 (HAUSP) and USP10, regulate p53 (Li et al., 2002; Sheng et al., 2006; Yuan et al., 2010) .In addition to ubiquitination, several post-translational modifications including hydroxylations affect p53 signaling. Transcriptional activity is repressed by the hydroxylation of a C-terminal lysine catalyzed by JMJD6, a hydroxylase previously shown to act as histone demethylase and lysine hydroxylase (Wang et al., 2014) . Three additional hydroxylases regulate the broader p53 pathway. FIH, an asparagine hydroxylase, hydroxylates the p53 binding protein ASPP2 on a C-terminal residue (Janke et al., 2013) . Second, it was shown that PHD1, a proline hydroxylase, can regulate p53 by mediating the p38a-dependent phosphorylation of serine 15 in response to chemotherapeutic drugs (Deschoemaeker et al., 2015b) . Finally, PHD3 enhances HCLK2 binding to ATR by hydroxylating several proline residues (Xie et al., 2012) . PHD3 has been most prominently linked to the cellular response to hypoxia and is one of three PHDs shown to destabilize HIF1/2a (Epstein et al., 2001) . We identified p53 as an interaction partner of PHD3 in a substrate-trap assay and were intrigued by this finding as regulation of p53 by PHD3 could help explain why p53 expression levels are regulated in a dynamic and non-linear fashion in hypoxic conditions. With this in mind, we set out to identify if and by which mechanism PHD3 directly regulates p53. A) HEK293T cells were transfected in biological triplicates with an empty vector control, V5-tagged PHD1, PHD2, PHD3, or FIH. 24 hr post-transfection, the cells were treated with DMSO or DMOG for 4 hr.

{"s2orc_id": 8133149, "title": "Keratin 17 Is Induced in Oral Cancer and Facilitates Tumor Growth", "abstract": "Keratin subtypes are selectively expressed depending on the cell type. They not only provide structural support, but regulate the metabolic processes and signaling pathways that control the growth of the epithelium. KRT17 (keratin 17) is induced in the regenerative epithelium and acts on diverse signaling pathways. Here, we demonstrate that KRT17 is invariably and permanently induced in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), as revealed by immunohistochemistry and cDNA microarray analysis. Two representative OSCC cell lines; KRT17-weakly expressing Ca9-22 and KRT17-highly expressing HSC3 were used to establish KRT17-overexpressing Ca9-22 and KRT17-knockdown HSC3 cells. Analysis of these cells revealed that KRT17 promoted cell proliferation and migration by stimulating the Akt/mTOR pathway. KRT17 also upregulated the expression of SLC2A1 (solute carrier family 2 member 1/Glut1) and glucose uptake. To further investigate the effect of KRT17 on tumorigenesis, KRT17-knockout HSC3 cells were established and were transplanted to the cephalic skin of nude mice. The tumors that developed from KRT17-knockout HSC3 cells had a lower Ki-67 labeling index and were significantly smaller compared to the controls. These results indicate that KRT17 stimulates the Akt/mTOR pathway and glucose uptake, thereby facilitating tumor growth. We could not confirm the relationship between KRT17 and SFN (stratifin) in the cells examined in this study. However, our study reinforces the concept that the cellular properties of cancer are regulated by a series of molecules similar to those found in wound healing. In OSCC, KRT17 acts as a pathogenic keratin that facilitates tumor growth through the stimulation of multiple signaling pathways, highlighting the importance of KRT17 as a multifunctional promoter of tumorigenesis.", "citation_paragraph": "Our previous studies on the keratins that are downregulated in OSCC have uncovered some essential characteristics of OSCC. The loss of KRT4 and KRT13 expression represents maturation abnormality in the neoplastic epithelium [11] . KRT15 and KRT19 are also downregulated in OSCC, and the expression levels of the remaining KRT15 and KRT19 represent differentiation and the invasive potential of the cancer, respectively [19] . The loss of these physiological keratins appears to be compensated by ectopic induction of other keratins. This is not random upregulation of diverse keratin subtypes; instead, specific keratins are markedly induced [11] . In the present study, we demonstrated that the induction of KRT17 is a fundamental feature of OSCC. KRT17 showed the same cellular localization as the other keratins in cancer cells, indicating that KRT17 was correctly incorporated into the cytoskeleton. This suggests that KRT17 replaces the physiological keratins and plays a substantial role in a controlled manner even in OSCC. The existence of subtype-specific functions is still controversial, but mounting evidence indicates that keratins regulate diverse physiological processes in a context dependent manner [4, 25] . The unique expression pattern of KRT17 during development appears to reflect its specific function. KRT17 expression is initiated in the early stages of skin development at the epithelial placodes [7] ; it is maintained during epithelial appendage formation and continues in basal/myoepithelial cells [3] . Despite the differences in final forms, the processes of appendage formation share the common cellular dynamics of proliferation, migration, invagination, and branching, suggesting that KRT17 may play a role in these developmental dynamics [7] . Cancer growth and spread are also propelled by these morphogenetic cell dynamics. Indeed, we found that KRT17 promoted tumor growth by stimulating the Akt/mTOR pathway and glucose uptake. This signaling cascade also plays a crucial role in wound healing [26, 27] . Therefore, both in physiological and pathological contexts, KRT17 appears to fulfill the role of a socalled signaling platform [28] : an emerging concept which may help explain the diverse impact of keratin functions. However, the mechanisms by which KRT17 acts as the signaling platform remain elusive.Data obtained from the keratin-null mice suggest that keratins modulate the membranous localization of SLC2A1, and that the level of surface SLC2A1 expression regulates mTOR signaling in an adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent manner [14] . This theory places SLC2A1 upstream of MTOR. However, the elevated expression of SLC2A1 may also be the consequence of activation of the Akt/mTOR pathway, considering the previous studies showing that MTOR regulates the insulin-dependent expression of SLC2A1 [29, 30] and promotes trafficking of SLC2A1 to the cell membrane [31] , also that AKT1 stimulates the transcription [32] and the cell surface localization [33] of SLC2A1. Feedback mechanisms orchestrate these molecules, thereby maintaining proper glucose uptake [34] , but much more research is required to understand how KRT17 participates in the regulation of glucose metabolism.In normal mouse cutaneous keratinocytes, KRT17 mediates the effect of SFN on the Akt/ mTOR pathway by retaining SFN in the cytoplasm [12] . Mikami et al. reported nuclear translocation of SFN following KRT17 knockdown in the OSCC cell line ZK-1, as revealed by immunocytochemistry [35] . However, such a relationship between KRT17 and SFN was not evident in the human cells examined in this study, suggesting that KRT17 also activates the Akt/mTOR pathway by other means in OSCC.Keratins modulate the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathways through physical interaction with the signaling proteins. For example, KRT8 and KRT18 associate with TNFRSF1B (tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 1B/TNFR2) and attenuate its signal transduction [36] , and KRT17 interacts with TRADD (TNFRSF1A-associated via death domain) and regulates TNF alpha signaling [37] . The interaction between keratins and signaling proteins is an interesting aspect of keratin behavior.The expression of KRT17 is controlled by the transcription factor GLI2 [38, 39] , which acts as an oncogene in OSCC [40] . Krt5-Gli2 transgenic mice develop multiple basal cell carcinomas of the skin that are characterized by robust expression of KRT17 in the tumor cells [41] . Genetic ablation of Krt17 delays tumor development in transgenic mice [42] , suggesting that GLI2-driven KRT17 expression has tumor-promoting activity. In humans, GLI2 is detected in about half of OSCC cases and is significantly associated with poor clinical outcomes [43] . These findings suggest that the GLI2-KRT17 axis may play an important role in the progression of OSCC. KRT17 also modulates the expression of the transcriptional regulator AIRE (autoimmune regulator) in diseased epithelia, which induces the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and supports tumor progression [44] . Collectively, these findings, including the present ones, highlight the importance of KRT17 as a multifunctional promoter of tumorigenesis.Our study reinforces the concept that the cellular properties of cancer are regulated by a series of molecules similar to those found in wound healing.

{"s2orc_id": 201601702, "title": null, "abstract": null, "citation_paragraph": ".1 is an inwardly rectifying potassium channel with important roles in the regulation of the membrane potential in retinal pigment epithelium, uterine smooth muscle, and hypothalamic neurons. Regulation of G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) via the G protein \u2424\u2425 subunits has been well characterized. However, how Kir channels are regulated is incompletely understood. We report here that Kir7.1 is also regulated by GPCRs, but through a different mechanism. Using Western blotting analysis, we observed that multiple GPCRs tested caused a striking reduction in the complex glycosylation of Kir7.1. Further, GPCR-mediated reduction of Kir7.1 glycosylation in HEK293T cells did not alter its expression at the cell surface but decreased channel activity. Of note, mutagenesis of the sole Kir7.1 glycosylation site reduced conductance and open probability, as indicated by single-channel recording. Additionally, we report that the L241P mutation of Kir7.1 associated with Lebers congenital amaurosis (LCA), an inherited retinal degenerative disease, has significantly reduced complex glycosylation. Collectively, these results suggest that Kir7.1 channel glycosylation is essential for function, and this activity within cells is suppressed by most GPCRs. The melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R), a GPCR previously reported to induce ligand-regulated activity of this channel, is the only GPCR tested that does not have this effect on Kir7.1.Kir7.1, encoded by the Kcnj13 gene, is a two-transmembrane domain potassium channel, closer in homology to Kir channels associated with potassium transport such as Kir1.1, 4.x, and 5.1 (1) . Compared with other channels, Kir7.1 exhibits a small unitary conductance and low dependence on external potassium (2) . This was shown to be due to the presence of a methionine at position 125 in the pore, where other Kir channels have an arginine. Mutation of this residue to arginine was found to mimic/restore the conductance and potassium dependence observed in like-family channels. Kir7.1 is widely expressed, but particularly high expression has been reported in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), 2 thyroid, uterine smooth muscle, small intestine, and choroid plexus of the brain (3, 4) .Until recently, Kir7.1 was primarily studied within the RPE. In RPE cells, Kir7.1 is found in the apical membrane close to photoreceptor neurons, where it is thought to contribute to ion homeostasis (5) . Mutations in Kir7.1 lead to snowflake vitreoretinal degeneration and Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), which are both retinal dystrophies (6 -10) . In jaguar/obelix zebrafish, mutations in Kir7.1 affect pigment patterns, specifically as a result of the failure of melanosomes to respond to changes in light (11) . These functional mutations of Kir7.1 in RPE cells and melanocytes have been characterized and shown to cause alterations in channel currents resulting in the described pathologies.Recent studies have also identified a role for Kir7.1 in the regulation of uterine smooth muscle excitability (12) . Specifically, Kir7.1 expression is elevated by 30-fold midgestation, hyperpolarizing muscle cells and reducing uterine excitability. This expression falls off toward the end of pregnancy, leading to parturition. In the mouse, Kir7.1-null mutations cause perinatal lethality, and this was determined to be due to a role for Kir7.1 in tracheal tubulogenesis (13) . Kir7.1 was also revealed to be a potential regulator of neuronal excitability in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, through modulation of channel activity by the G protein-coupled melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) (14) . Activation of MC4R led to robust neuronal depolarization, which was found to be mediated by Kir7.1 channel closure. Conversely, inhibition of MC4R by an endogenous inverse agonist, AgRP, led to channel opening and hyperpolarization of the neuron. These results are interesting in that Kir7.1 is not a canonical G proteincoupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channel such as Kir3.x. Furthermore, in HEK293T cells, Kir7.1 was found to exist in a complex with MC4R (14) .Mechanisms by which non-GIRK channels interact with GPCRs vary, with some channels behaving like GIRKs, such as Kir2.x channels. Specifically, unlike Kir2.1, it has been reported that Kir2.3 channels can be inhibited directly by G \u2424\u2425 complexes (15) . Moreover, within dendritic spines of cholinergic neurons, M1 receptor activation has been shown to lead to inhibition of Kir2.x channels through G q activation of phospholipase C, which depletes the second messenger phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP 2 ) that is needed for Kir channel function (16) . Kir7.1 likewise has a PIP 2 dependence for activity and was recently shown in RPE cells to be regulated by the oxytocin G q -coupled GPCR, through phospholipase C-mediated inhibition (17) . However, the MC4R-mediated closure of Kir7.1 was found to be independent of G proteins (14) . The mechanism by which this occurs is unknown, and examples exist of receptors interacting with Kir channels in the absence of G proteins and other second messengers. Specifically, Kir6.2 and the non-GPCR sulfonylurea receptor (SUR), a target of sulfonylurea drugs used to treat diabetes, form the K ATP channel (18) . This heterooctamer composed of Kir6.2 subunits in 1:1 stoichiometry with SUR1/2 is expressed in the pancreas, and ATP binding to the SUR subunits increases channel open probability (19) . SUR communicates with Kir6.2 through direct interaction between the C-terminal tail of Kir6.2 and an intracellular loop of SUR (20, 21) .In our initial investigations of potential molecular mechanisms of interaction for Kir7.1 with MC4R, we observed that co-expression of several GPCRs with Kir7.1 in HEK293T cells led to a dramatic reduction in complex glycosylated forms of Kir7.1 present in the cell. A review of the role of glycosylation within this family of inwardly rectifying potassium channels revealed that glycosylation of Kir1.1, a close family member, reduces open channel probability (22, 23) . In patients with multiple sclerosis, autoantibodies against glycosylated forms of Kir4.1 have been reported, but the role for this in the pathophysiology of the disease is unclear (24, 25) . A role for glycosylation of Kir7.1 has not been investigated. We report here on a novel functional role of GPCRs in the complex glycosylation and function of Kir7.1.", "citance": "Kir7.1 was also revealed to be a potential regulator of neuronal excitability in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, through modulation of channel activity by the G protein-coupled melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) (14) .", "claims": [{"text": "Kir7.1 modulates channel activity by the G protein-coupled melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 20042304, "title": "Kr\u00fcppel-like factors compete for promoters and enhancers to fine-tune transcription", "abstract": "Kr\u00fcppel-like factors (KLFs) are a family of 17 transcription factors characterized by a conserved DNA-binding domain of three zinc fingers and a variable N-terminal domain responsible for recruiting cofactors. KLFs have diverse functions in stem cell biology, embryo patterning, and tissue homoeostasis. KLF1 and related family members function as transcriptional activators via recruitment of co-activators such as EP300, whereas KLF3 and related members act as transcriptional repressors via recruitment of C-terminal Binding Proteins. KLF1 directly activates the Klf3 gene via an erythroid-specific promoter. Herein, we show KLF1 and KLF3 bind common as well as unique sites within the erythroid cell genome by ChIP-seq. We show KLF3 can displace KLF1 from key erythroid gene promoters and enhancers in vivo. Using 4sU RNA labelling and RNA-seq, we show this competition results in reciprocal transcriptional outputs for >50 important genes. Furthermore, Klf3-/- mice displayed exaggerated recovery from anemic stress and persistent cell cycling consistent with a role for KLF3 in dampening KLF1-driven proliferation. We suggest this study provides a paradigm for how KLFs work in incoherent feed-forward loops or networks to fine-tune transcription and thereby control diverse biological processes such as cell proliferation.", "citation_paragraph": "We have directly addressed whether two KLFs from different clades (KLF1 and KLF3) with opposing biochemical functions, can bind to the same enhancers and promoters in the same cell type (erythroid cells) to 'fine-tune' gene expression. Different KLFs are co-expressed in the many cell types often alongside SP family members. This this is the first study that directly addresses whether they can compete for the same promoters or enhancers in vivo and whether they can functionally antagonise each other.Previous work has shown KLF1 is an important erythroid transcription factor that primarily binds enhancers and super-enhancers (3, 70) to activate gene expression (Figure 6A) . We recently found an extended repertoire of KLF1-occupied enhancers in erythroid cell lines (25) , which are immortalized at the pro-erythroblast stage of differentiation. This is primarily due to technical advances resulting in greater sequencing depth and reduced background noise compared with previously published work (3). Many of these enhancers are not occupied by KLF3 (Figure 8A ), so it is unclear whether other KLF/SP proteins can compete with KLF1 at these enhancers to limit the activity of KLF1. We found more than 4000 KLF3-occupied sites in the erythroid cell genome; these were primarily at promoters of non-expressed genes. Thus, KLF3 likely plays a role in active repression of genes whose expression in not required ( Figure 8B ). This observation is consistent with our previous published work in MEFs (24) . Some KLF3-occupied promoters had KLF1-occupied enhancers elsewhere in the same gene (e.g. Alad), suggesting KLF3 can also repress erythroid genes via a KLF1-independent mechanism ( Figure  8C ).We found KLF3 preferentially binds promoters whereas KLF1 prefers enhancers, so we asked, 'why'? One possible answer resides in the non-DNA-binding domains of the proteins which recruit different co-activator and corepressor proteins and may physically interact with other TFs. For example, KLF1 might be able to directly or indirectly interact with TAL1 and/or GATA1 and this interaction might be facilitated by the precise spacing of complimentary DNA-binding motifs in enhancers (3) . Similarly, KLF3 might directly or indirectly interact with TFs to facilitate its preference for promoters. Using de novo motif discovery and statistical analyses of relative over representation of defined motifs, we found KLF3 prefers to bind in the neighborhood of CCAAT boxes, NRF1 motifs, ETS motifs, CREB motifs and to a lesser extent, CTCF and LRF/Pokemon motifs (Figures 1 and 2 ).It is difficult to know whether KLF3 is recruited to promoters because of a physical interaction (direct or indirect) with NF-Y protein components and/or with NRF1 (which are both promoter-trophic TFs), or whether the motifs are simply enriched because KLF3 binds promoters for other reasons (71) (72) (73) . There is an historical association between the CCAAT and CACCC (or GC-box) in basal gene promoters including those directing erythroid gene expression; e.g. both motifs are critical within the \u2424-globin gene promoter (74) . There is also extensive evidence of functional synergy between SP family proteins and NF-Y proteins using promoter-reporter assays (75) , and for physical interactions between SP proteins and NF-Y components, particularly NF-YA (76) . Also, there is recent published evidence that SP2 can bind DNA indirectly via interaction with NF-Y proteins (5) . Further biochemical and mutational studies would be required to distinguish whether KLF3 (like SP factors) can physically interact with NF-Y components, facilitate or inhibit NF-Y promoter occupancy, and/or functionally antagonise NF-Y driven promoter activity. We have previously reported deletion of the N-terminal domain of KLF3 leads to specific failure to bind promoters in MEFs (24) . This result might suggest direct or indirect physical interactions between the N-terminus of KLF3 and NF-Y components facilitates KLF3 promoter occupancy.The enrichment of ETS motifs in KLF3-bound DNA suggests ETS-domain proteins such as FLI-1, ERG and PU.1 might bind near to KLF3. ETS proteins are important for megakaryopoiesis, hematopoietic stem cell function, myelopoiesis and lymphopoiesis. Indeed, we find FLI-1-bound sites in megakaryocytes and KLF3-bound sites in pro-erythroblasts overlap (Figure 2 ). Our ChIP-seq data does not necessarily argue KLF3 binds alongside FLI-1 in pro-erythroblasts. Rather, KLF3 and ETS proteins could bind the same genomic regions in different cell types or compete for binding in bi-potent progenitor cells (MEPs). Interestingly, over expression of KLF1 can suppress Fli1 and the megakaryocytic program (77, 78) , whereas loss of KLF1 results in lineage infidelity and upregulation Nucleic Acids Research, 2017, Vol. 45, No. 11 6585 of megakaryocytic genes such as Itga2b (which encoded CD41) and Pf4 in erythroid cells (79) . Lastly, conditional knockout of Fli1 leads to erythroid hyperplasia (80) . We suggest some of these effects might be mediated via KLF3 which is itself a direct KLF1-target gene (22) . For example, binding of KLF3 to FLI-1-occupied sites might repress the megakaryocytic program in erythroid cells. Likewise, KLF3 binding to PU.1-occupied regions might suppress myelopoeisis. In this way, KLF3 could influence lineage decisions via antagonism of lineage specific ETS-binding proteins.We found a subset of KLF1-bound regions that are cobound by KLF3. Most of these are important erythroid enhancers such as the E2f2 intron 1 enhancers ( Figure 8D ). We used 4sU metabolic labeling of new transcripts and RNAseq to show reciprocal regulation of 54 genes (including E2f2) after induced overexpression of KLF1 or KLF3. This suggests an important incoherent type 1 FFL (27) in which KLF3 can 'fine tune' erythroid gene expression driven by KLF1 ( Figure 8D ). We confirmed dose-dependent reciprocal regulation of E2f2 using enhancer-reporter assays, and modest upregulation of E2f2 in Klf3 \u2212/\u2212 fetal liver and adult spleen. Interestingly, we found an exaggerated proliferation state and enhanced S phase on Klf3 \u2212/-splenic erythroid cells following recovery from hemolytic stress (Figure 7) . Together, these results suggest KLF3 provides a physiological brake on KLF1-induced proliferation through competition for critical enhancers.Of the 54 inversely regulated genes, three encode SER-TAD (SERTA Domain Containing) genes. SERTADs have been shown to enhance the transcriptional activity of the E2F family of TFs (81, 82) . Both E2f2 and E2f4 have known roles in erythropoiesis (83, 84) . So, it is possible the SER-TAD proteins are playing an important role in the regulation of DNA replication during erythroid development via their ability to modulate the function of E2F proteins. Interestingly, it has been recently reported that KLF10 regulates Sertad1 in pancreatic tissue (85) . SERTADs might regulate the function of additional TFs to the E2Fs. Thus, KLF1 and KLF3 could also indirectly 'fine-tune' the function of many TFs by inversely regulating the production of the coactivating SERTAD proteins.Three Klf genes are themselves reciprocal targets of KLF1 and KLF3 in erythroid cells; i.e. Klf10 (Tieg), Klf11 (Tieg2) and Klf16 (Figure 4 ). KLF1 and KLF3 both bind the Klf11 gene promoters which are reciprocally regulated. Additionally, KLF1 activates Klf9 and Klf13 independently of KLF3, while KLF3 represses Klf6. Klf11 gene knockout mice exhibit a mild erythroid phenotype (86) . Other KLFs have not been studied in detail in an erythroid cell context although previous work suggests many are expressed (12) . So, there are likely to be additional KLF networks at play during erythroid cell differentiation, and these might further tune gene expression.KLF networks are important in many other cell types. For example Klf2, Klf3 and Klf4 are co-expressed in myeloid cells. Conditional gene knockouts of Klf4 and Klf2 indicated they are important for proper myeloid cell differentiation and function, respectively (87, 88 ). An early report suggests Klf3 knockout mice produce an excess of white blood cells (89) , but this has not been investigated in detail. KLF2, KLF4 and KLF5 bind to each other's promoters as well as to critical stem cell gene promoters and enhancers in ES cells to provide a coherent FFL (27) which underpins the ES cell transcriptional state, or 'stemness' state (11, 90) . Could members of the KLF3/8/12 clade compete for occupancy at key ES cell enhancers and the promoters to displace KLF2/4/5 and thereby facilitate ES cell differentiation via engagement of an incoherent FFL? Similarly, KLF4 (or Gut Kr\u00fcppel-like factor) and KLF5 (or Intestinal Kr\u00fcppel-like factor) are both expressed in the gut epithelium in overlapping patterns (91, 92) . We suggest KLF3, which is also highly expressed in the gut, could compete with activating KLFs to regulate the turnover of the gut epithelium. KLF4 and KLF3 are also both expressed in the skin. KLF4 gene knockout mice die within 24 hours of birth due to dehydration because and they display defective terminal differentiation and cornification of the skin (93) . Interestingly, Klf3 is a direct target of KLF4 in the skin (94) . No skin defects have been described in Klf3 knockout mice, but this is worth exploring.In summary, our study demonstrates functional competition between KLF1 and KLF3 for enhancers and promoters in erythroid cells. This fine-tunes the transcriptional response of target genes. Since the Klf3 gene is itself a direct target of KLF1, we suggest an incoherent KLF3 feedforward network is wired to provide a brake on the transcriptional activation by KLF1, and that this is important for cell proliferation. Since activating and repressing KLFs are co-expressed in most cell types, we suggest these studies provide a paradigm for how KLF feedforward networks can be tempered by the KLF3/8/12 clade of KLFs ( Figure  8C ).", "citance": "Conditional gene knockouts of Klf4 and Klf2 indicated they are important for proper myeloid cell differentiation and function, respectively (87, 88 ).", "claims": [{"text": "Klf2 is important for proper myeloid cell function.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Klf4 and Klf2 are needed for proper myeloid cell differentiation and function.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Klf4 is important for proper myeloid cell differentiation.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Klf4 is not required for proper myeloid cell differentiation.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}

Polycomb repressive complexes mediate oncogene-induced senescence, a principal innate cell-intrinsic tumor suppressor pathway that thwarts expansion of cells that have suffered oncogenic hits. Infections with human cancer viruses including human papillomaviruses (HPVs) and Epstein-Barr virus can trigger oncogene-induced senescence, and the viruses have evolved strategies to abrogate this response in order to establish an infection and reprogram their host cells to establish a long-term persistent infection. As a consequence of inhibiting polycomb repression and evading oncogene induced-senescence, HPV infected cells have an altered epigenetic program as evidenced by aberrant homeobox gene expression. Similar alterations are frequently observed in non-virus associated human cancers and may be harnessed for diagnosis and therapy.", "citation_paragraph": "PcG genes were discovered in Drosophila melanogaster and named to denote a mutant phenotype that, in addition to segmentation defects, displays formation of aberrant sex combs on the legs of male flies. PcG proteins form macromolecular repressor complexes, polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs), that globally regulate transcriptional competence of genes that play important roles in cell fate specification and maintenance of stem cell pools [16] .There are two major PRC species, designated PRC1 and PRC2, which play critical roles in epigenetic gene silencing. PRC2 contains the EZH2 enzyme, which places a trimethyl mark on lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3). This repressive mark causes chromatin compaction and gene silencing. PRC1 occupies H3K27me3 marked chromatin and further silences the chromatin by mono-ubiquitination of lysine 119 on histone H2A (H2AK119Ub) (Figure 2 ). Some PRC1 complexes can also silence gene expression in the absence of repressive H3K27me3 marks since H2AK119Ub marked chromatin is a binding site for the L3MBTL2 protein, which then establish repressive structures [17] that are particularly important in pluripotent stem cells [18] . There is compelling evidence that PRCs regulate epithelial cell differentiation as well as expansion of basal cell pools during wound healing [19] [20] [21] . As described in more detail above, HPVs may need to target both of these processes to allow for viral progeny synthesis and establishment of long-term persistent infection, respectively. Hence, PRC components and molecules that regulate their activity are attractive targets for HPV proteins.The best-known transcriptional targets of PRCs are the homeobox (HOX) genes, which encode a family of related transcription factors that contain a homeodomain. HOX family members are frequently dysregulated during carcinogenesis [22, 23] and germline HOXB13 mutations have been linked to an increased risk for the development of prostate cancer [24] . HOX proteins are not only downstream transcriptional targets of PRCs, but they also mediate PRC repressor activities on some of their target genes [25] .", "citance": "Some PRC1 complexes can also silence gene expression in the absence of repressive H3K27me3 marks since H2AK119Ub marked chromatin is a binding site for the L3MBTL2 protein, which then establish repressive structures [17] that are particularly important in pluripotent stem cells [18] .", "claims": [{"text": "L3MBTL2 binds to H2AK119Ub marked chromatin to form a PRC1 complex.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "PRC1 complexes are important for silencing gene expression in pluripotent stem cells.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Atherosclerosis may eventually lead to severe events, including sudden mortality, myocardial infarction (MI) or acute coronary syndrome (ACS). These events are often dependent on inflammatory changes within the arterial walls (1) .As a biomarker of plaque inflammation and stability (2), lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A 2 (Lp-PLA 2 ) plays an important role in the progression of atherosclerosis (3). Lp-PLA 2 is a pro-inflammatory enzyme that hydrolyzes oxidized phospholipids to generate lysophosphatidylcholine and oxidized fatty acids (4) . This enzyme non-covalently binds to plasma lipoproteins (5) . Lp-PLA 2 binds with a much higher affinity to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) than to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (5) . Approximately 80% of Lp-PLA 2 is attached to LDL and the rest to HDL in plasma (2) . LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) has a causal role in the development of cardiovascular disease (6) . Epidemiological evidence has established a strong correlation between low levels of HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) and cardiovascular events (7) . A 1 mg/dl increase in HDL-C results in a 3% reduction in CHD outcomes (8) . CHD subjects often have abnormal phenotypes, including high LDL-C, low HDL-C and high triglyceride (TG) concentrations (9) .A meta-analysis identifed a high risk of cardiovascular events for patients with high Lp-PLA 2 levels (2 important for the formation of an atherosclerotic plaque and its rupture (10) . Another meta-analysis of ~80,000 participants in 32 prospective studies identified that high levels of Lp-PLA 2 mass and activity are associated with a risk of CHD, stroke and cardiovascular mortality (11) . Lp-PLA 2 activity has also been shown to be a predictive factor for stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) (12) . Grallert et al (13) identified seven Lp-PLA 2 -associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including rs7528419 of the CELSR2 gene, rs7756935 and rs1805017 of the PLA2G7 gene, rs964184 of the ZNF259 gene, rs10846744 of the SCARB1 gene, rs247616 of the cholesteryl ether transfer protein (CETP) gene and rs6511720 of the LDL receptor (LDLR) gene.

The composition of the proteome is adjusted to the specific requirements of a particular cell type and status. Moreover, multiple metabolic and environmental conditions challenge the integrity of the proteome. To maintain the quality of the proteome, the proteostasis network monitors proteins from their synthesis through their degradation. Whereas somatic stem cells lose their ability to maintain proteostasis with age, immortal pluripotent stem cells exhibit a stringent proteostasis network associated with their biological function and intrinsic characteristics. Moreover, growing evidence indicates that enhanced proteostasis mechanisms play a central role in immortality and cell fate decisions of pluripotent stem cells. Here, we will review new insights into the melding fields of proteostasis and pluripotency and their implications for the understanding of organismal development and survival.", "citation_paragraph": "Protein translation is a fundamental step of gene expression by which ribosomes decode mRNAs to synthesize new proteins as linear chains of amino acids [1] . Protein translation consists of three phases: initiation, elongation, and termination. Regulation of protein synthesis can occur at any phase of translation and it may be either specific for distinct transcripts or specific for global. For instance, phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2A\u03b1 impairs the recruitment of the Met-tRNA to the 40S ribosome subunit, resulting in down-regulation of global translational rates [20, 21] . Protein translation is differentially regulated among distinct cell types, a process that contributes to establish and maintain differences in cell identity and function [22] .Given that protein synthesis rates impinge upon multiple biological processes that determine cell identity and status, this process is tightly regulated. For instance, the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation crucially depends on activation or repression of protein translation [22] . Several studies in animal models demonstrate that changes in global translational rates are essential to facilitate transition into differentiated states. This is the case of mouse haematopoietic stem cells, which require enhanced protein synthesis to maintain their stemness [23] . In Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, precise regulation of translational rates influences the function and proliferation of immortal germline stem cells (GSCs), which are designed to generate gametes for reproduction and maintain an unlimited proliferative capacity [24] [25] [26] [27] . Given their biological function and particular characteristics, ESCs must have intrinsic regulatory mechanisms to control protein translation (Fig. 1) . Emerging evidence indicates that ESCs exhibit high demand for increased translational rates to sustain their elevated self-renewal activity and pluripotency [19] . In mouse ESCs (mESCs), down-regulation of global protein synthesis rates results in loss of pluripotency as observed with either translational inhibitors or knockdown of genes involved in ribosome biogenesis [19] . Moreover, this study showed that the high global translational rates of mESCs decrease during their differentiation into either embryoid bodies or neural cells [19] . General up-regulation of translation in mESCs is linked with their elevated expression of several subunits (e.g., Ddx47, Krr1) of the small subunit processome (SSUP), a complex that mediates 18S rRNA biogenesis and intensify global protein synthesis [19] . Concomitantly, knockdown of distinct SSUP components impairs 40S ribosome biogenesis in mESCs. Pluripotency factors such as Nanog promote the high expression of SSUP subunits in mESCs, providing a direct link between pluripotency and elevated protein synthesis [19] . In addition, the translation of ribosomal proteins itself undergoes a strong repression when mESCs differentiate into embryoid bodies [28] . While ribosomal protein genes are highly expressed in embryoid bodies, their transcripts are translated less efficiently than the typical mRNAs. In support of a link between enhanced protein synthesis and pluripotency, mESCs produce high levels of pre-rRNA by maintaining the rDNA promoter in an unmethylated state [29] . Whether the aforementioned regulatory mechanisms are evolutionary conserved in human ESCs (hESCs) and iPSCs remained to be elucidated. However, it is important to note that other findings do not support a model of increased global translational rates in ESCs. A previous study indicated that protein translation is parsimonious in mESCs, whereas the global loading of mRNAs in translating polysomes increases during early differentiation into embryoid bodies, resulting in increased protein synthesis and content [30] . This process is modulated by increased phosphorylation of 4EBP1 through activation of the mTOR pathway in embryoid bodies, resulting in the release of active eIF4E complexes that up-regulate global translation [30] . Moreover, mESCs also exhibit an intrinsic translation of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) by which these cells precisely regulate protein synthesis to impact gene expression genome-wide. uORFs are central regulators of gene expression located in the 5\u2032UTR of the mRNA and, therefore, precede the initiation codon of the main codon region [31] . When translation starts from the uORF, protein synthesis of the actual ORF is impaired [31] . Interestingly, mESCs display increased uORF translation compared with their differentiated counterparts [28] . Given that approximately, half of the human transcripts possess uORFs [31] , this process could also play an important role in the regulation of global translational rates of hESCs.Remarkably, post-transcriptional modifications of RNA modulate ESC identity and cell fate decisions. N6-methyladenosine (m 6 A), the most abundant post-transcriptional modification in RNA [32] , is involved in all aspects of RNA metabolism, including mRNA turnover [33, 34] and translation efficiency [35] . Whereas several studies propose proteins, pluripotent stem cell function requires increased expression of chaperone core machinery genes. In addition, the intrinsic chaperome network of pluripotent stem cells maintains the proper folded state of proteins from their synthesis through their degradation, resulting in decreased accumulation of damaged/misfolded proteins and aggregates. Although differentiated cells exhibit decreased translational rates, a concomitant down-regulation in the chaperone/ folding system diminishes their ability to refold damaged/misfolded proteins and restrain protein aggregation that m 6 A modifications are required to maintain ESC identity [17, 34] , other findings suggest that m 6 A determines ESC commitment to differentiated states [35, 36] . Notably, the chromatin-associated zinc finger protein 217 (ZFP217) modulates the global levels of m 6 A in ESCs. ZFP217 interacts with epigenetic modulators to activate the transcription of multiple core pluripotency factors while reduces m 6 A deposition on these pro-pluripotency transcripts to promote their translation [17] . Likewise, growing evidence indicates that distinct RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) also play central roles in hESC identity and cell fate decisions. RBPs participate in practically any step of gene expression involving RNA such as turnover and translation [18] . One of the most studied RBPs in the context of pluripotency is LIN28, which is highly expressed in ESCs to regulate the stability and translation of hundreds of mRNAs that define ESC identity [37] .Taken together, global protein synthesis rates as well as post-transcriptional co-regulation of functionally related genes determine ESC identity. However, there are still many intriguing aspects to be examined in the field. Moreover, most of the studies used mESCs as a primary model, whereas translational regulatory mechanisms remain largely unknown in human pluripotent stem cells. Thus, it will be particularly fascinating to define how human pluripotent stem cells regulate global translational rates and their changes during cell differentiation/reprogramming.", "citance": "One of the most studied RBPs in the context of pluripotency is LIN28, which is highly expressed in ESCs to regulate the stability and translation of hundreds of mRNAs that define ESC identity [37] .Taken together, global protein synthesis rates as well as post-transcriptional co-regulation of functionally related genes determine ESC identity.", "claims": [{"text": "LIN28 is highly expressed in embryonic stem cells.", "subject": "LIN28", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "LIN28 is not expressed in embryonic stem cells.", "subject": "LIN28", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "LIN28 regulates the stability and translation of mRNAs that define embryonic stem cell identity.", "subject": "LIN28 ", "is_negation": false}]}

Our results showed that elevated NEAT1 expression in human HGSOC specimens correlated with a poor prognosis. Functional experiments demonstrated that knockdown of NEAT1 significantly prohibited ovarian cancer cell proliferation and invasion in vitro and restrained tumor growth in vivo. LIN28B was identified by bioinformatics analysis along with experimental evidence as a direct actor that enhanced NEAT1 stability. A rescue functional assay confirmed that the LIN28B/NEAT1 axis contributed to oncogenic functions in ovarian cancer cells. Moreover, gene expression profile data and dual luciferase reporter assay results demonstrated that NEAT1 functioned as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR-506 to promote cell proliferation and migration. Taken together, our results showed that NEAT1, stabilized by LIN28B, promoted HGSOC progression by sponging miR-506. Thus, NEAT1 can be regarded as a vital diagnostic biomarker for HGSOC and a therapeutic target.", "citation_paragraph": "With the recent development of high-throughput techniques, a variety of systematic cancer genomics projects have been conducted to investigate different molecular pathways and to identify genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic alterations in cancers 28, 29 . These investigations have focused not only on protein-coding genes but also on long noncoding transcripts, which have been shown to be involved in the regulation of a diverse array of biological processes. This study focused on NEAT1, which is a lncRNA that has been studied as the core structural component of paraspeckles 7, 8, 10 . A great deal of effort has been expended to understand the functional role of NEAT1 in cancer progression. For example, Zhen et al. showed that NEAT1 promoted glioma pathogenesis by interacting with the miR-449b-5p/c-Met axis 30 . In addition, NEAT1 was found to promote papillary thyroid cancer through regulating ATAD2 expression by sponging miR-106b-5p 31 . In regards to chemo-resistance, NEAT1 was found to upregulate EGCG-induced CTR1 and enhance cisplatin sensitivity in lung cancer cells 32 . Moreover, NEAT1 was found to be associated with malignant progression in ovarian cancer and was reported to have clinical significance 17, 33, 34 . However, elucidating its detailed involvement in ovarian tumorigenesis requires further investigation.In our study, we found that the relative expression of NEAT1 was significantly increased in HGSOC tissues.

These results are consistent with those of the previous studies and support a role for NEAT1 as a functional oncogenic lncRNA in HGSOC. Next, we sought to identify the underlying molecular mechanisms by which NEAT1 exerts its modulatory effect on malignant EOC phenotypes. Previous studies reported that posttranscriptional regulation through specific RBPs was emerging as a critical regulatory level for nearly all biological processes 19 . Recent reports have shown that NEAT1 interacts with some RBPs. Jiang et al. found that NEAT1 bound the RBPs NONO and PSF to enhance premiRNA processing 22 . To examine whether NEAT1 could bind to other RBPs in ovarian cancer cells, we performed a bioinformatics analysis, RNA pulldown assay, and RIP assay, which revealed that NEAT1 could combine with LIN28B. The molecular mechanisms underlying the function of LIN28B, as a member of the RBP family, were initially suggested to predominantly include regulation of the let-7 miRNAs, which have essential functions in inflammation, wound healing, embryonic stem cells, and cancer [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . LIN28B expression is associated with tumor initiation, progression, resistance, and poor outcomes in several solid cancers [40] [41] [42] [43] , including ovarian cancer [44] [45] [46] . However, few reports have investigated the interactions between LIN28B and lncRNAs. Only lncRNA H19 has been found to interact with LIN28B 23 . Our results extend current knowledge on the functional role of lncRNA-LIN28 complexes. However, the longer transcript of NEAT1 has a weak binding capacity with LIN28B. There are a few reasons why the longer transcript NEAT1_2 has a much weaker binding capacity with LIN28B than does NEAT1_1. First, the two transcripts have different lengths, which may result in different secondary structures. Second, it is believed that NEAT1_2, not NEAT1_1, is indispensable for paraspeckle formation. Although they both promote tumorigenesis, these two NEAT1 isoforms are reported to be involved in different cellular activities 47 , suggesting that the binding capacity with LIN28B may differ between the two transcripts. Third, recent reports have shown that NEAT1_2 interacts with some RBPs 48 . It is possible that other RBPs may affect the combination of LIN28B and NEAT1_2. Fourth, primers are responsible for different binding capacities. In the present study, we designed two primers named NEAT1 (which can detect both transcripts) and NEAT1-2 (which can only detect the long transcript), so the abundance of NEAT1 in cells differed between the two primers used for detection. The present study identified LIN28B as an important player in the regulation of NEAT1 expression by enhancing its stability. Rescue assays confirmed the function of the LIN28B/NEAT1 axis in ovarian cancer cells.Additional findings of the present study involve the identification of downstream molecules associated with NEAT1 functions. The data obtained from the GEO database (GEO accession: GSE45158) indicated that NEAT1 influences multiple biological processes, including cell-cell adhesion. Cell adhesion plays a pivotal role in tumorigenesis and is regarded as an important component of the EMT. Emerging evidence suggests that lncRNAs may function as ceRNAs or molecular sponges to modulate the activities of miRNAs. To further elaborate the relationship between NEAT1 and EMT, we investigated whether NEAT1 could act as a ceRNA. As a recognized EMT-associated molecule, miR-506 has been reported to be expressed in many types of cancer and to regulate EMT-associated genes, such as Snail2, Vimentin, and ETS-1 27, 49, 50 . Luciferase assays and Western blotting showed that NEAT1 might sponge miR-506 to promote tumorigenesis. Future work is needed to elucidate the detailed mechanism by which NEAT1 regulates miR-506 and to further delineate the network controlled by NEAT1 during HGSOC progression.In summary, this study is the first report to investigate a potential interaction between NEAT1 and LIN28B during HGSOC progression. We found that NEAT1 was overexpressed and was associated with poor patient survival. NEAT1 promoted EOC cell proliferation, tumor invasion and metastasis in vitro, and cell proliferation in vivo. Moreover, we observed that NEAT1 might promote tumorigenesis by sponging miR-506. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular details of HGSOC and potential therapeutic targets to combat this disease.", "citance": "LIN28B expression is associated with tumor initiation, progression, resistance, and poor outcomes in several solid cancers [40] [41] [42] [43] , including ovarian cancer [44] [45] [46] .", "claims": [{"text": "LIN28B expression is associated with better outcomes in neuroblastoma.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "LIN28B expression is associated with poor outcomes in neuroblastoma.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1/NR5A2) might be a good candidate. We performed in vitro studies for the interplay between SF-1, LRH-1 and DAX-1, expression profiles in human steroidogenic tissues, and NR5A2 genetic studies in a cohort (11 patients, 8 relatives, 11 families) harboring heterozygote NR5A1/SF-1 mutations. LRH-1 isoforms transactivate the CYP17A1 and HSD3B2 promoters similarly to SF-1 and compensate for SF-1 deficiency. DAX-1 inhibits SF-1- and LRH-1-mediated transactivation. LRH-1 is found expressed in human adult and fetal adrenals and testes. However, no NR5A2/LRH-1 mutations were detected in 14 individuals with heterozygote NR5A1/SF-1 mutations. These findings demonstrate that in vitro LRH-1 can act like SF-1 and compensate for its deficiency. Expression of LRH-1 in fetal testis suggests a role in male gonadal development.

Interestingly, we found that DAX-1 is a strong repressor of LRH-1-induced transactivation of the CYP17A1 and a moderate repressor of the HSD3B2 promoter ( fig. 3 ) . Differences on the effect of DAX-1 may be explained again by the number of effective DNA-binding sites in the regulated promoters [Hanley et al., 2001 ]. In addition, it has been shown that the binding affinity between the cofactors may modulate the transactivation effect, as stronger binding and effect was demonstrated between DAX-1 and SF-1 than for DAX-1 and LRH-1 .LRH-1 and SF-1 can only collaborate in tissues where they have overlapping expression profiles.

Overall, LRH-1 is expressed in all human adult and fetal adrenals and testes with the highest expression for LRH-1 isoform 1 when compared to SF-1 and DAX-1. Isoform 1 was lowest in adult testis and isoforms 2, 3 and 4 were low expressed in all examined tissues. Control HepG2 cells expressed LRH-1 only, but no SF-1 and DAX-1. SF-1 is not expressed in adult rat liver [Falender et al., 2003 ], whereas DAX-1 has shown mixed results in mouse liver [Kawabe et al., 1999; Niakan and McCabe, 2005; Nedumaran et al., 2009] . The expression profile of LRH-1 and its isoforms for different organs, cells and species has been described in previous studies with variable results [Li et al., 1998; Wang et al., 2001; Sirianni et al., 2002; Peng et al., 2003; Fayard et al., 2004; Pezzi et al., 2004; Gao et al., 2006 Gao et al., , 2007 Dub\u00e9 et al., 2009; Yazawa et al., 2009; Sierens et al., 2010; Kawabe et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013] . This might be due to the fact that some isoforms are only expressed at very low levels, and for technical reasons, it is not easy to find a PCR strategy for the specific isoforms. In our hands, the most challenging was isoform 2. Previous studies showed that LRH-1 is expressed in human adult adrenals [Wang et al., 2001; Sirianni et al., 2002; Yazawa et al., 2009] , fetal adrenals [Wang et al., 2001 ] as well as human adult testes [Sirianni et al., 2002; Yazawa et al., 2009] and ovaries [Peng et al., 2003; Yazawa et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2013] . LRH-1 expression in human fetal testis is reported in our study for the first time; its expression in the developing testis has been only shown in rats so far [Guo et al., 2007; Sierens et al., 2010] . Human LRH-1 isoform 4 has only been reported recently [Kawabe et al., 2013] . It is described in ovarian tissue and cells as a granulosa cell-specific isoform (gc-LRH-1) which is not found in HepG2 liver cells [Kawabe et al., 2013] . We detected LRH-1 isoform 4 in adrenal, testis and liver (HepG2) demonstrating that it is not ovary specific. In granulosa cells, isoform 4 was also shown to be controlled by an alternate promoter which is located upstream of exon 2 and is under the control of both SF-1 and gc-LRH-1/isoform 4 [Kawabe et al., 2013] . Thus, alternate promoter usage may prompt variable expression of LRH-1 isoforms.Human mutations for NR5A2 /LRH-1 are not known. We searched for LRH-1 mutations in our cohort (11 families, 19 individuals) for subjects harboring heterozygote NR5A1 /SF-1 mutations for explained reasons. We did not find disease-causing mutations, but some sequence variations which qualify for SNPs when comparing and analyzing with genetic data available for the normal population in several data bases ( table 1 ) . However, our genetic analysis which focused on exons and boundaries may miss (intronic) mutations.Several studies have shown that LRH-1 plays an important role in female sexual and reproductive function [Zhang et al., 2013] . LRH-1 is differentially expressed in the female reproductive system [Falender et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2013] and differentially expressed when compared to SF-1 [Falender et al., 2003; Fayard et al., 2004] . Heterozygote NR5A1 mutations may cause ovarian insufficiency [Louren\u00e7o et al., 2009; Camats et al., 2012] . We thought that phenotypical variability in disease state may be explained by variable compensation through LRH-1. This hypothesis appears supported by our in vitro findings, but not by the genetic analysis of our patients. Similarly, LRH-1 seems to play a role in male sex development and function as it is expressed in fetal and adult testis and it regulates gene expression of CYP17A1 and HSD3B2, which are essential for androgen production. Compared to SF-1, LRH-1 seems to have a partially overlapping expression profile in the testis regarding development [Pezzi et al., 2004; Guo et al., 2007; Yazawa et al., 2009; Sierens et al., 2010] and cell specificity [Pezzi et al., 2004; Sierens et al., 2010] , but the exact interplay of both transcription factors is not known. Additionally, our study clearly shows that LRH-1 cannot compensate fully for heterozygote NR5A1 mutations in humans, although this seems possible in vitro. Together with the finding that heterozygosity for mutant NR5A1/ SF-1 in humans is able to cause disease while all tested in vitro systems cannot reflect this state, we still think that a second hit in yet another gene could explain the broad phenotype of NR5A1/ SF-1 mutations. Therefore, in the era of next generation sequencing, we are now conducting exome sequencing analyses on several patients with identified NR5A1 /SF-1 mutations in search for other candidate genes which may solve the conundrum of the broad phenotype in these DSD patients.", "citance": "Several studies have shown that LRH-1 plays an important role in female sexual and reproductive function [Zhang et al., 2013] .", "claims": [{"text": "LRH-1 plays an important role in female sexual and reproductive function.", "subject": "LRH-1", "is_negation": false}]}

Emerging evidence shows a strong correlation between circulating FGF21 levels and the incidence and severity of atherosclerosis. Animal studies have demonstrated a beneficial role of FGF21 in protecting against aberrant lipid profile, while recent development in FGF21 mimetics has provided further insight into the lipid-lowering effects of FGF21 signaling.

It is also predictive of cardiovascular events and mortality in type 2 diabetic patients [27] . Moreover, FGF21 strongly correlated with a number of independent risk factors for atherosclerosis, including obesity [28] , type 2 diabetes [29, 30] , hypertension [31] , non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [32] [33] [34] , diabetic nephropathy [35] , chronic kidney disease [36] , and dyslipidemia [22, 37] . In particular, serum FGF21 correlated positively with total cholesterol and triglyceride [37] , and negatively with high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1) [22] .

The lipid-lowering properties of FGF21 in atherosclerosis have been demonstrated in atherosclerosis-prone apoE -/-mice [39] . Lack of FGF21 in these mice led to marked exacerbation of atherosclerotic plaque formation and reduced lifespan [39] . Mechanistic studies showed that, in addition to acting through adiponectin-dependent mechanisms which inhibit local vascular inflammation and neointima formation [39] , FGF21 attenuates hypercholesterolemia by suppressing the activity of hepatic sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 and reducing cholesterol synthesis [39] . Hepatic deficiency of \u03b2-klotho largely compromised the cholesterol-lowering effects of FGF21, for which FGFR2 was responsible [39] . In line with this, FGF21 suppresses the expression of stearoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) denaturase 1 and 3-hydroxy-3methylglutaryl-CoA reductase in the liver in mice, which are involved in lipogenesis and cholesterol synthesis respectively [40] . Therefore, the liver appears to be a major target of FGF21 in suppressing cholesterol and lipid levels. The lipid-lowering effects of FGF21 have been consistently demonstrated in mice [18, 41] .

Similar presence of p16 in all groups of patients and no p21 detection was observed.

Because of its impact on physical and psychological health of patients [3, 4] and of its socioeconomic impact [5] , endometriosis can be considered a public health problem and deserves further investigation [1, [6] [7] [8] [9] . It is characterized by implantation and growth of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity [10] , and it is often associated with dysmenorrhea, deep dyspareunia, acyclic pelvic pain, infertility and alterations of the intestinal and urinary habits [11, 12] .There seems to be a similarity between endometriosis and cancer [13] [14] [15] [16] , particularly deep infiltrating endometriotic lesions, shares features with neoplastic processes, such as self-sufficiency in growth signals, insensitivity to anti-proliferative signals, resistance to apoptosis, sustained Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:https ://doi.org/10.1007/s0040 4-018-4691-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.angiogenesis, tissue invasion, and genomic instability [17, 18] . Additionally, endometriosis and some types of cancer have alterations in the expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes [19, 20] that are related to features that are commonly observed in both diseases, such as proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle arrest [21, 22] .There is a correlation of a few oncogenes involved in cell cycle regulation, cell repair mechanism, replication and DNA repair and programmed cell death [23] [24] [25] [26] such as cyclins p16INK4a (p16) and p21 WAF1 (p21), with the progression of tumors [27] . Some studies suggest the involvement of increased p16 in tumor proliferation, invasiveness and angiogenesis by inhibiting cellular proliferation thus protecting cells from malignant transformation [28, 29] . Increased p21 and p16 expression have been described in endometrioma and endometrial polyps, respectively, suggesting a role of cyclins in some endometrial disorders [30] [31] [32] . Even though the involvement of p21 and of p16 in the more invasive types of endometriosis should be expected, none study has yet described an altered expression of such cell cycle biomarkers in deep infiltrating endometriosis.Other proteins involved with cell cycle regulation in tumorigenesis are lamins. Lamins (A, B and C) are a group of proteins found inside the inner layer of the nuclear membrane of all cells [33] and are associated with the nuclear membrane structure maintenance. Lamin B1 is particularly involved with proliferation [34] . Moreover, higher lamin B1 seems to be associated with prostate and liver cancer, whereas lower lamin B1 was seen in breast, pancreas, and others types of cancer [35] [36] [37] [38] , commonly connected to an increased proliferative capacity and apoptosis instability of tumors, as that protein is able to prevent or delay apoptosis depending on the amount of lamin present [39] .Although there is a robust amount of evidence showing the role of p16, p21 and lamins in cancer and other diseases, there are hitherto no reports of their involvement on the development and maintenance of endometriosis, particularly in the deep infiltrating phenotype. Due to the clear involvement of cell cycle regulation in proliferative, invasiveness and apoptotic processes, the present study aims to test the hypothesis that p16, and p21 are higher and lamin B1 is lower in endometriotic lesions as compared to the eutopic endometrium, suggesting the presence of a higher number of senescence cell in endometriotic tissue.

The nucleoplasm is heterogeneous, owing to the preferential localization of specific metabolic factors, which lead to the definition of nuclear compartments or bodies. The genome is organized into chromosome territories, as well as heterochromatin and euchromatin domains. Recent observations have indicated that nuclear organization is important for maintaining genomic stability. For example, nuclear organization has been implicated in stabilizing damaged DNA, repair-pathway choice, and in preventing chromosomal rearrangements. Over the past decade, several studies have revealed that dynamic changes in the nuclear architecture are important during double-strand break repair. Stemming from work in yeast, relocation of a damaged site prior to repair appears to be at least partially conserved in multicellular eukaryotes. In this review, we will discuss genome and nucleoplasm architecture, particularly the importance of the nuclear periphery in genome stability. We will also discuss how the site of relocation regulates repair-pathway choice.", "citation_paragraph": "Damage from laser micro-irradiation at any sub-nuclear region of the nucleus, revealed a pan-nuclear signaling mechanism that resulted in rRNA transcriptional silencing (Larsen et al. 2014 ). This silencing is associated with transient recruitment ofNijmegen breakage syndrome protein 1 (NBS1) into the nucleoli, which interacts with Treacle (referred to as TCOF1) (Larsen et al. 2014; Ciccia et al. 2014) . Recent studyshowed that NBS1 accumulation in the nucleoli occurs in an MRE11 independent manner (Lafrance-Vanasse, Williams, and Tainer 2015), and indicates that one function of NBS1 might be in regulating RNA Pol II transcribed genes upon damage. Previous to this, NBS1 functions in response to DNA damage were only described in association with MRE11 and RAD50.A very important question remained which was how DSBs that are generated between the rDNA repeats are most commonly repaired. A recent report, based on inducing DSBs inside the rDNA using I-Ppol, which has a 15 base-pair recognition site in the 28S coding sequence of each rDNA, suggested that non-homologous en-joining (NHEJ) is the privileged repair pathway of DSBs in rDNA (Harding, Boiarsky, and Greenberg 2015) . The nucleoplasm is organized into nuclear compartments. This organization is important for maintaining a smooth cellular metabolism and division. The organization is dynamic and is known to change during metabolic processes. Several studies have and are revealing the functional importance of the nuclear organization. The nuclear envelope and the nuclear pore complexes are implicated in the repair of heterochromatic regions.The lamina is known to be a gene poor compartment with a limited number of Lamina associated domains (LADs). The nucleoli, which appear as dark spheres using DAPI staining are the sites transcription of the rDNA genes into rRNA and are known to be non-permissive for recombination events. Other nuclear compartments such as the Cajal bodies, nuclear speckles and paraspeckles are implicated in metabolic processes.The chromosomes are organized into territories, with limited inter-chromosomal interactions and favored intra-chromosomal. Silent regions of the chromosome can be organized as the stiff heterochromatin (red oval), DSBs induced inside the heterochromatin are repaired by homologous recombination which initiates inside the heterochromatic domain by the recruitment of ATRIP/TopBP1, Nse2, SMC5/6 and dPIAS. Repair by HR is blocked once the single stranded Rad51 filament is exposed. In Drosophila, the product is relocated to the nuclear periphery where the HR proceeds.This relocation of the highly \"recombinable\" Rad51 filament is to prevent unlawful recombination inside the heterochromatin and prevent genomic instability. In mouse D r a f t cells, the damage site relocates to the periphery of the heterochromatic domain. DSBs inside euchromatic domains (green oval) are most commonly repaired by NHEJ.

Establishing a diagnosis is important because traditional heart failure treatment regimens can worsen left ventricular failure in this disease. Endomyocardial biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis; however, scintigraphy with radiolabeled phosphate derivatives and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging have been shown to have high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing cardiac amyloidosis. Furthermore, cardiac scintigraphy can reliably differentiate amyloid subtypes. We present a case of transthyretin-related cardiac amyloidosis with a negative endomyocardial biopsy but positive 99m-technetium pyrophosphate single photon emission computed tomography scan and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. We discuss the utility of 99m-technetium pyrophosphate imaging in cardiac amyloidosis and the role of single photon emission computed tomography. Finally, we review the several forms of cardiac amyloidosis and how they pertain to cardiac scintigraphy.", "citation_paragraph": "Cardiac amyloidosis, often considered as a single clinical entity, is better characterized as a group of diseases caused by the extracellular deposition of fibrillary proteins in the heart [1] . There are three main types defined by different pathological substrates and clinical courses. Cardiac amyloid light-chain (AL) is due to clonal proliferation of immunoglobulin lightchains in the bone marrow leading to protein aggregation and fibrillary deposits. Transthyretin-related cardiac amyloidosis is due to misfolding of the transthyretin protein (TTR) with resulting aggregation into fibrillary deposits. It can be due to mutations in TTR, in which case it is called the ATTRm form of cardiac amyloidosis, or due to wild-type, nonmutant TTR, in which case it is called ATTRwt and mainly affects older men [2] . Differentiating between AL and ATTR variants is important because AL portends a worse prognosis and is typically treated with chemotherapy targeting plasma cells. Treatment of ATTR subtypes of cardiac amyloidosis involves liver and/or heart transplantation in select individuals, and conventional heart failure management, with numerous potentially disease-modifying strategies emerging over the past several years [3] .The gold standard for diagnosing cardiac amyloidosis is endomyocardial biopsy. However, non-invasive imaging methods are being increasingly used to allow safer and earlier detection [4] . In a study of 33 patients with endomyocardial biopsy proven cardiac amyloidosis, MRI was shown to have a sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 80% in diagnosing cardiac amyloidosis [5] . Late gadolinium enhancement has also been shown to precede left ventricular morphologic alterations in many cases [6] . However, cardiac MRI is unable to reliably differentiate between AL and ATTR subtypes of cardiac amyloidosis, an important distinction that dictates treatment and prognosis [7] .Over the recent years, there is increasing interest in the use of cardiac scintigraphy for the early detection and differentiation of cardiac amyloidosis [8] . Radiolabeled bisphosphonates were first shown to detect cardiac amyloidosis and distinguish AL from ATTR subtypes with the use of 99m-technetium-3,3-diphosphonate-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid [9] ; however, this isotope is not Food and Drug Administrationapproved and not available in the United States. More recently, the widely available isotope 99mTc-PYP has been shown to be able to distinguish cardiac amyloid subtypes. Using the quantitative measure H/CL with a cutoff value > 1.5, ATTR subtype amyloidosis can be detected with a 97% sensitivity and 100% specificity [2] . Other quantitative methods have also been proposed, including the \"pyrophosphate score,\" which is the Fig. 2 -Thoracic scan in the anterior view performed 1 hour after administration of 99m-technetium pyrophosphate. (A) There is intense radiotracer accumulation in the myocardium. (B) Region of interest markers placed over the myocardium and contralateral right lung for quantification of radiotracer activity. The total counts within the myocardial region of interest divided by the contralateral counts were used to calculate the heart-to-contralateral ratio. ratio of the myocardial mean counts to ventricular cavity mean counts. This method has a reported sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 95% for diagnosing cardiac amyloidosis without differentiating amyloid subtypes [10] . The use of SPECT has also been investigated to improve anatomic radiotracer localization [11] . However, it is currently difficult to quantify radiotracer activity on SPECT, which makes it difficult to assess disease burden and response to therapy [12] . Interestingly, once a diagnosis of ATTR is made, follow-up 99mTc-PYP scintigraphy does not show significant changes despite obvious clinical disease progression [13] .Negative endomyocardial biopsy in the setting of highly suspected cardiac amyloidosis is rare. Biopsies positive for cardiac amyloidosis will demonstrate Congo red staining with apple-green birefringence under polarized light microscopy. In false-negative cases, electron microscopy has been shown to demonstrate the presence of rigid, non-branching fibrils [14] . Under-sampling has also been shown to decrease the diagnostic yield from endomyocardial biopsy with a 45% accurate pathologic diagnosis with 5 or more samples compared to only 20% with 1-3 samples [15] . In our case, electron microscopy was not performed and only three samples were obtained from the right ventricle.Our case illustrates the value of 99mTc-PYP cardiac scintigraphy in diagnosing cardiac amyloidosis and specifically its use in subtyping the disease in the setting of a negative endomyocardial biopsy.

Profound hypovolemia is common in these patients and has the potential to exacerbate the acidosis and acute kidney injury that are independent predictors of death. However, new microvascular imaging techniques have shown that disease severity correlates more strongly with obstruction of the microcirculation by parasitized erythrocytes--a process termed sequestration. Fluid loading has little effect on sequestration and increases the risk of complications, particularly pulmonary edema, a condition that can develop suddenly and unpredictably and that is frequently fatal in this population. Accordingly, even if a patient is clinically hypovolemic, if there is an adequate blood pressure and urine output, there may be little advantage in infusing intravenous fluid beyond a maintenance rate of 1 to 2 mL/kg per hour. The optimal agent for fluid resuscitation remains uncertain; significant anemia requires blood transfusion, but colloid solutions may be associated with harm and should be avoided. The preferred crystalloid is unclear, although the use of balanced solutions requires investigation. There are fewer data to guide the fluid management of severe vivax and knowlesi malaria, although a similar conservative strategy would appear prudent.", "citation_paragraph": "Although there is a tendency to categorize adults with SFM as either 'dry' and at increased risk of acidosis and AKI or 'wet' and at increased risk of APO, this appears too simplistic an approach. Multi-organ involvement is the rule in the patients with the most severe disease. Fluid management is challenging in these patients, although again a more conservative approach is more likely to be beneficial [42] .In one Indian SFM series, 69% of adults with both AKI and APO died, the case-fatality rate was 14% if APO occurred in isolation, and there were no deaths in patients with only AKI [43] . In another Indian study, the risk of death increased with both renal failure and respiratory failure, but all patients with AKI alone survived and no patient in the series had APO in isolation [34] . In a South African series, 7 out of 8 deaths occurred in patients with concomitant AKI and APO [40] , whereas in a French series, most patients with APO had multiorgan involvement (83% had AKI) and were more likely to die [44] . In a Portuguese series, over three quarters of the deaths occurred in patients with concurrent AKI and APO [45] , and in PRISM all of the patients who died had APO while anuric [25] . In a British series, the only patient whose death was directly attributable to malaria died of multi-organ failure with concomitant AKI and APO [39] .Lessons from pediatric malaria SFM has a different clinical spectrum in adults and children: in adults, coma duration is longer, severe anemia is less frequent, and AKI and APO are much more common [46] . However, there are important similarities in pathophysiology in the two populations, particularly the fundamental role of sequestration. In studies examining the fluid resuscitation of adults and children with SFM, there are many comparable findings.Although hypovolemia is present in children with SFM, it is relatively mild when assessed by using standardized measures and is not commensurate with the degree of end-organ pathology. Gabonese children with SFM were only mildly dehydrated when assessed isotopically; despite this, over half had a plasma lactate of more than 5 mmol/L [47] . Retinal changes consistent with sequestration have been documented in children with SFM and correlate with outcome and sequestration seen at autopsy [48] [49] [50] . These findings suggest that, as in adults, sequestration and endothelial dysfunction can explain the clinical manifestations of disease in children without hypovolemia being invoked.The fluid resuscitation of children with SFM has been explored on a larger scale than in adults, culminating in the landmark FEAST (Fluid Expansion as Supportive Therapy) study [51] . Here, febrile African children with clinical evidence of hypoperfusion (57% with P. falciparum parasitemia) were randomly assigned on admission to the hospital to receive boluses of either 20 to 40 mL/kg of 5% albumin or 0.9% saline or to receive no boluses; standard care was otherwise provided. The mortality was increased to a similar degree in the children receiving an albumin or saline bolus (relative risk of death: 1.59) compared with the control group.A retrospective analysis suggested that the increased mortality resulted from cardiovascular collapse rather than fluid overload per se, although this conclusion was somewhat hampered by limited data regarding the participants' deaths. The mechanism for this cardiovascular collapse was unclear, although a rapid reduction in sympathetically mediated compensatory mechanisms and treatment-induced hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis were suggested. Although APO and increased intracranial pressure were suspected in some patients, neither was identified frequently [52] .", "citance": "Gabonese children with SFM were only mildly dehydrated when assessed isotopically; despite this, over half had a plasma lactate of more than 5 mmol/L [47] .", "claims": [{"text": "Less than 10% of the gabonese children with Schimmelpenning-Feuerstein-Mims syndrome (SFM) had a plasma lactate of more than 5mmol/L.", "subject": "plasma lactate", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Over half of the gabonese children with Schimmelpenning-Feuerstein-Mims syndrome (SFM) had a plasma lactate of more than 5mmol/L.", "subject": "plasma lactate", "is_negation": false}]}

DESIGN The process included a modified Delphi method, a consensus conference, several subsequent smaller meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee.   METHODS The modified Delphi methodology used for grading recommendations built on a 2001 publication sponsored by the International Sepsis Forum. We undertook a systematic review of the literature graded along five levels to create recommendation grades from A to E, with A being the highest grade. Pediatric considerations to contrast adult and pediatric management are in the article by Parker et al. on p. S591.   CONCLUSION Fluid resuscitation of severe sepsis may consist of natural or artificial colloids or crystalloids. Fluid challenge should be administered and repeated based on response (increase in blood pressure and urine output) and tolerance (evidence of intravascular volume overload).", "citation_paragraph": "The optimal hemoglobin and hematocrit for patients with septic shock is unclear, and recent years have seen several changes in attitudes toward blood transfusions in critically ill patients. First, optimal transfusion triggers have been rethought, with studies suggesting that with the possible exception of patients with acute myocardial disease (21) , patients can tolerate and may even benefit from hemoglobin levels lower than the traditional 10 g/dL (22) . Anemia in critically ill patients is associated with a worse outcome, but blood transfusions have also been associated with increased mortality (23) , and the challenge is to decide who should receive a transfusion and when. Interestingly, recent epidemiologic evidence suggests that red blood cell transfusions may no longer be associated with increased mortality. This apparent change may be related to the widespread introduction of leuko-reduction in recent years. The use of leuko-reduced blood has been associated with fewer infectious complications, and in a retrospective, before/after cohort study, Hebert et al. (24) showed that leuko-reduction was associated with reduced mortality rates.

Evidence in support of potential benefit includes findings that fish oil supplementation during pregnancy results in higher n\u22123 LCPUFA levels in infants that are associated with beneficial changes in immune responses 9 ; in addition, several studies have shown a lower incidence of allergic sensitization among infants born to mothers who supplemented with fish oil than among infants born to mothers who did not, as well as a lower prevalence of allergic disorders, including food allergies, atopic dermatitis, and wheezing illnesses in the first year of life, 8 with possible persistence until later in life. 10 A negative trial failed to show protection, 11 but it is important to note that it was not associated with clinically significant adverse outcomes. In this issue of the Journal, Bisgaard et al. 12 provide new data that support the use of n\u22123 LCPUFAs during pregnancy. They show that the offspring of women who received 2.4 g per day of n\u22123 LCPUFAs from 24 weeks of gestation until 1 week after delivery had a lower risk of asthmatic symptoms and fewer respiratory infections than the offspring of women who were assigned to placebo. The number of women who would need to be treated to prevent one case of persistent wheezing or asthma was 14.6 among women in the entire cohort and 5.6 among women in the lower third of preintervention EPA and DHA levels. Thus, there is benefit and little risk associated with n\u22123 LCPUFA supplementation. Even though we do not know Ms. Franklin's EPA and DHA levels, there is likely to be a benefit for her child, at little risk, cost, or inconvenience. She should start taking n\u22123 LCPUFA supplements.Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. Ms. Franklin should not start prenatal fish oil supplements on the basis of the results of a single study. Clinical practice decisions are best made in accordance with practice guidelines based on well-conducted systematic reviews, preferably of several randomized, controlled trials. In the area of marine oil supplementation during pregnancy, there have been in excess of 50 randomized, controlled trials assessing the effects of the bioactive n\u22123 LCPUFAs on outcomes as diverse as pregnancy duration, the risk of prematurity, infant birth weight, maternal depression, and childhood neurobehavioral outcomes, as well as allergy and asthma outcomes.The trials assessing the effect of prenatal n\u22123 LCPUFA supplementation on childhood allergy and asthma outcomes have been driven largely by the plausible hypothesis that diets high in n\u22123 LCPUFAs may modulate the development of immunoglobulin E-associated allergic disease. There is some supportive evidence from a Cochrane systematic review that showed that at least 1 g of n\u22123 LCPUFA supplementation daily during pregnancy resulted in rates of atopic eczema in the first 3 years of life and of sensitization to allergens during the first year of life among children with a higher-than-normal risk of allergic dis- ease that were lower than the rates among children whose mothers did not receive n\u22123 LCPUFA supplementation. 13 The review showed no clear effects on asthma or wheezing outcomes. 13 The two largest and highest-quality trials show contrasting results. Bisgaard et al. 12 found a 31% lower rate of persistent wheezing or asthma at 3 to 5 years among infants whose mothers received n\u22123 LCPUFA supplementation than among infants whose mothers did not receive the supplementation, with no significant effects on eczema or allergic sensitization; in contrast, Palmer et al. 14 found lower rates of allergic sensitization and atopic eczema at 1 year that were no longer evident at 3 or 6 years; there were no significant effects of n\u22123 LCPUFA supplementation on wheezing or asthma at 3 and 6 years. 11, 15 These inconsistencies are perplexing and may be related to differences in the populations studied or in the definitions used to diagnose asthma. Asthma can be difficult to diagnose accurately in early childhood, and not all persistent wheezing is asthma. 16 Children may have 10 or more virusrelated colds in a year, and respiratory symptoms may last for 2 or more weeks. 16 An unexpected finding reported by Bisgaard et al. 12 was that prenatal n\u22123 LCPUFA supplementation was also associated with a lower risk of lower respiratory tract infections in children. How the symptoms of persistent wheezing or asthma were related to the occurrence of respiratory tract infections and whether the frequency of respiratory tract infections was also related to the higher-than-anticipated rate of persistent wheezing or asthma are not clear.In considering outcomes beyond allergy and asthma, there is consistent evidence that prenatal n\u22123 LCPUFA supplementation extends the length of pregnancy, which is associated with a lower rate of early preterm birth (<34 weeks of gestation) as well as a higher rate of obstetrical intervention because of prolonged gestation. 17 While we work to reconcile all relevant data for fish oil supplementation in pregnancy in a way that is useful for clinical decision making, it seems prudent to advise Ms. Franklin to follow standard-of-care surveillance for persistent wheezing and asthma in her child after birth.Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.From the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, North Adelaide, SA, Australia.", "citance": "Bisgaard et al. 12 found a 31% lower rate of persistent wheezing or asthma at 3 to 5 years among infants whose mothers received n\u22123 LCPUFA supplementation than among infants whose mothers did not receive the supplementation, with no significant effects on eczema or allergic sensitization; in contrast, Palmer et al. 14 found lower rates of allergic sensitization and atopic eczema at 1 year that were no longer evident at 3 or 6 years; there were no significant effects of n\u22123 LCPUFA supplementation on wheezing or asthma at 3 and 6 years.", "claims": [{"text": "Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids supplementation has no significant effects on wheezing or asthma at 3 and 6 years.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids supplementation reduces wheezing and asthma.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}
{"s2orc_id": 3379755, "title": "Sutures Possess Strong Regenerative Capacity for Calvarial Bone Injury.", "abstract": "Repair of calvarial bony defects remains challenging for craniofacial surgeons. Injury experiments on animal calvarial bones are widely used to study healing mechanisms and test tissue engineering approaches. Previously, we identified Gli1+ cells within the calvarial sutures as stem cells supporting calvarial bone turnover and injury repair. In this study, we tested the regenerative capacity of the suture region compared with other areas of calvarial bone. Injuries were made to mouse sagittal sutures or other areas of the calvarial bone at varying distances from the suture. Samples were collected at different time points after injury for evaluation. MicroCT and histological analyses were conducted. EdU incorporation analysis was performed to assay cell proliferation. Gli1-CreERT2;Tdtomatoflox mice were used to trace the fate of Gli1+ stem cells after injury. Calvarial sutures possess much stronger regeneration capability than the nonsuture bony areas of the calvaria. The healing rate of the calvarial bone is inversely proportional to the distance between the suture and injury site: injuries closer to the suture heal faster. After complete removal of the sagittal suture, regeneration and restoration of normal organization occur within 6 weeks. Gli1+ cells within the suture mesenchyme are the cellular source for injury repair and bone regeneration. These results demonstrate that calvarial bone healing is not an evenly distributed event on the calvarial surface. Sutures contain stem cells and are the origin of calvarial bone tissue regeneration. Therefore, current practice in calvarial surgery needs to be reevaluated and modified. These findings also necessitate the design of new approaches for repairing calvarial bony defects.", "citation_paragraph": "In our current study, we have found that calvarial sutures possess stronger regeneration capacity than other regions of the calvarial bone and that the regenerative capacity of the calvarial bone diminishes with increasing distance from the suture. Our findings support and extend our previous findings that Gli1+ cells within the suture mesenchyme are mesenchymal stem cells supporting craniofacial bone turnover and injury repair [18] . The healing of a calvarial bone injury is not an evenly distributed process on the calvaria bone. The regenerative capacity of calvarial bone diminishes with increasing distance from the suture. The presence of resident stem cells within the suture is likely the reason for the stronger regeneration capability of the suture. These stem cells can be immediately activated into proliferation upon injury and migrate to support the injury repair of non-suture regions of the calvaria.Our study provides a reasonable explanation for the presence of critical-size defects (CSD). A CSD is defined as a large bony defect that cannot heal without the assistance from a reparative material [13] . Critical-size calvarial defects are typically managed through reconstruction with metal implants or other materials [20] . Because the majority of the stem cell population of the calvarial bone resides within the suture, the ability of these mesenchymal stem cells to respond and migrate into an injury area in sufficient numbers for repair is dependent upon the distance of the injury site from the suture.Strikingly, we found that the sagittal suture can regenerate after complete removal. The newly regenerated suture was restored to its normal configuration and the Gli1+ population returned to a normal level within two months after injury, suggesting the maintenance of the stem cell population after regeneration. The cellular source for these stem cells could be other neighboring sutures, including the coronal and lambdoid sutures. This model is based on our observation that the closure of the suture wound was initiated from both ends. Furthermore, our recent study has shown that loss of Gli1+ stem cells within the suture leads to compromised healing of calvarial bone injury [18] . The regenerative property of the suture makes it a potential donor tissue for transplantation. In the future, we may be able to utilize autologous suture as seeds for the repair of large calvarial bony defects.Calvarial bone injuries have been widely used as models for analyzing the bone repair process and for evaluating tissue engineering approaches due to their accessibility and amenability to direct visualization. Injuries of different sizes or types are made to the calvarial bones and various materials or medications are applied to the injured area for comparison and evaluation [19] . Previous studies showed that the frontal bone and parietal bone possess differential regeneration capability due to their different developmental origins or endogenous FGF levels [16, 21, 22] . Our current study suggests that the suture responds to injury in a manner distinct from that of other areas of the calvarial bone. Therefore, the injury location on the calvarial bone is an important factor to be considered when designing experiments.Surgical removal of the suture followed by re-shaping of the calvarial bones is currently the standard approach for treating patients with craniosynostosis. The purpose of the surgery is to form artificial space between the calvarial bones to allow for future brain growth and expansion.Surprisingly, the natural suture tissue is routinely discarded as surgical waste during these procedures [23, 24] . Our results strongly suggest that this surgical practice should be reevaluated due to the essential roles of sutures in calvarial bone tissue homeostasis and regeneration.

{"s2orc_id": 13202357, "title": "Loss of microRNA-7a2 induces hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and infertility", "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are negative modulators of gene expression that fine-tune numerous biological processes. miRNA loss-of-function rarely results in highly penetrant phenotypes, but rather, influences cellular responses to physiologic and pathophysiologic stresses. Here, we have reported that a single member of the evolutionarily conserved miR-7 family, miR-7a2, is essential for normal pituitary development and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) function in adulthood. Genetic deletion of mir-7a2 causes infertility, with low levels of gonadotropic and sex steroid hormones, small testes or ovaries, impaired spermatogenesis, and lack of ovulation in male and female mice, respectively. We found that miR-7a2 is highly expressed in the pituitary, where it suppresses golgi glycoprotein 1 (GLG1) expression and downstream bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) signaling and also reduces expression of the prostaglandin F2a receptor negative regulator (PTGFRN), an inhibitor of prostaglandin signaling and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion. Our results reveal that miR-7a2 critically regulates sexual maturation and reproductive function by interconnecting miR-7 genomic circuits that regulate FSH and LH synthesis and secretion through their effects on pituitary prostaglandin and BMP4 signaling.", "citation_paragraph": "Genetic ablation of mir-7a2, but not mir-7a1 or mir-7b, leads to hypogonadism and infertility in mice. To investigate the physiological role of miR-7, we generated mice constitutively lacking mir-7a1 (referred to as mir-7a1 KO), mir-7a2 (referred to as mir-7a2 KO), or mir-7b (referred to as mir-7b KO) (Supplemental Figure 1 , A-D; supplemental material available online with this article; https:// doi.org/10.1172/JCI90031DS1). Heterozygous breedings of all 3 mouse strains were viable, had unaltered body weight and body length, and were born at normal Mendelian ratios (Supplemental Figure 1 , E-H). Interestingly, homozygous mir-7a2 KO male and female mice were infertile, while homozygous mir-7a1 KO or mir7b KO mice remained fertile, with unaltered reproductive rates (Supplemental Table 1 ).Homozygous mir-7a2 KO male mice failed to undergo sexual maturation and exhibited microphallus and hypogonadism with were enriched in pituitary as compared with hypothalamus (10-fold less), adrenal gland (50-fold less), or gonads (up to 500-fold less) and that miR-7a was 2.5-fold more abundant than miR-7b in pituitary (Supplemental Figure 2 , A and B). Given the low expression of miR-7a in male and female gonads, it is unlikely that miR7a would repress target genes and exert a biological function in testis and ovary (32) .As pre-miR-7a1 and pre-miR-7a2 are processed into an identical mature miR-7a sequence, the TaqMan probe of the miRNA assay cannot distinguish between the 2 miRNA gene products and thus measures combined miR-7a1 and miR-7a2 levels. To assess the contribution of miR-7a1 and miR-7a2 to the total pool of miR-7a in the pituitary, we analyzed expression levels of miR7a in mice lacking either mir-7a1 or mir-7a2. Interestingly, total miR-7a expression was reduced by approximately 80% in mir-7a2-deficient mice, while miR-7a levels appeared to be unchanged in mice lacking mir-7a1 when compared with WT littermate animals (Supplemental Figure 2 , C-F). Expression of miR-7b was unchanged in mir-7a1-and mir-7a2-deficient mice compared with WT animals, thereby confirming the specificity of the TaqMan assay.In conclusion, miR-7a2 is highly enriched in pituitary compared with other neuroendocrine tissues; furthermore, it accounts for the large majority of total pituitary miR-7 copies, and miR-7a1 and miR-7b cannot compensate for loss of miR-7a2 expression.miR-7a2 ablation causes hypopituitarism and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. To test whether the hypogonadism observed in mir-7a2 KO mice was caused by altered gene expression of essential pituitary genes, we performed RNA sequencing (RNASeq) of pituitaries from 6-week-old WT and mir-7a2 KO mice. We measured a dramatic decrease of gonadotropin expression with a reduction of Fshb mRNA by 86% (FDR = 5.94 \u00d7 10 ) in mir-7a2-deficient pituitaries that was already apparent in 2-week-old mice ( Figure 3A and Supplemental Figure 3A ). In addition, expression of the glycoprotein hormone \u03b1 subunit (Cga) and prolactin (Prl) mRNAs was reduced, while the expression of the GnRH receptor (Gnrhr) and other hormones of the anterior pituitary, including thyroid stimulating hormone \u03b2 (Tshb), growth hormone (Gh), and pro-opiomelanocortin -\u03b1 (Pomc), remained unchanged. Since lack of Prl does not lead to hypogonadism (33), we focused our investigation on the characterization of gonadotroph cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of pituitary sections revealed reduced numbers of FSH-expressing (-66%) and LH-expressing (-60%) cells in mir-7a2 KO mice (Figure 3 , B-E). We also observed that pituitary weights were reduced impaired and that the defect in mir-7a2 KO mice is primarily at the level of the pituitary (Supplemental Figure 3 , B and C). We then tested whether the hypopituitarism observed in mir-7a2 KO mice was responsible for the impaired gonadal function and anovulation by subjecting female mice to a standard superovulation treatment using pregnant mare serum. Ovulation was induced in hormone-treated mir-7a2 KO mice, indicating that ovaries were in both male and female mir-7a2 KO mice (Figure 3 , F and G). Importantly, the observed alterations of gene expression resulted in strongly decreased plasma concentrations of FSH and LH in male and female mir-7a2 KO mice ( Figure 3 , H-K). Furthermore, a GnRH stimulation test with buserelin revealed an increase of plasma FSH and LH levels in WT, but not mir-7a2 KO mice, further confirming that the response of gonadotropic cells to GnRH is principally functional and that hypophyseal-pituitary dysfunction was the primary cause for the hypogonadism in mir-7a2-ablated mice ( Figure 3L ). We can exclude that the relatively low expression of miR-7a in the hypothalamus affects GnRH-expressing neurons, as Gnrh mRNA levels, morphology, and expected projections of GnRH-expressing neurons were unaltered in mir-7a2 KO mice (Supplemental Figure 3 , D-F). Furthermore, transcript levels of neuropeptides and genes involved in the development and migration of GnRH neurons and expression of genes controlling GnRH secretion and action were similar in hypothalami of mir-7a2 KO and control littermates (Supplemental Figure 3 , G and H). Interestingly, the neuropeptides kisspeptin 1 (Kiss1) and tachykinin 2 (Tac2) were significantly increased in hypothalami of mir-7a2 KO mice, which corroborates findings that Kiss1 and Tac2 expression are under inhibitory modulation from circulating gonadal hormones (34, 35) . In addition, olfactory bulbs appeared to have normal size and architecture and no difference was detected in behavioral olfactory testing of male and female mice lacking mir-7a2 compared with littermate controls (data not shown, Supplemental Figure 3I ), suggesting that the hypogonadotropic phenotype was not due to defective GnRH neuron migration from the olfactory placode into the correct hypothalamic location during development. Collectively, these data demonstrate that mir-7a2 deficiency causes pituitary dysfunction and mirrors the disease pathology of human hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.Acute genetic ablation of miR-7a2 in adult mice recapitulates hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. To circumvent potential developmental effects caused by constitutive mir-7a2 ablation, we bred mice carrying a floxed mir-7a2 allele (referred to as mir7a2 fl/fl ) with transgenic mice expressing Cre-recombinase fused to a mutant form of the estrogen receptor ERT2 under the transcriptional control of the human ubiquitin C promoter (UBC- further validated by quantitative PCR (qPCR) that the mRNA transcripts of Ptgfrn and golgi glycoprotein 1 (Glg1), a member of the cysteine-rich fibroblast growth factor receptor family (40) , were increased in the pituitaries of mir-7a2 KO mice ( Figure 5E ). To test whether predicted mir-7 targets were repressed by increased miR-7 levels, we overexpressed miR-7a2 using a recombinant adenovirus (Ad-miR-7a2) in 2 gonadotroph cell lines, aT3 and LbT2, and observed significant repression of several predicted miR-7 target candidates (Supplemental Figure 4, C and D) . Together, these results reveal a tissue-specific regulation of direct and secondary miR-7 targets in the pituitary, with strong effects on upstream regulators of prostaglandin and BMP4 signaling.", "citance": "Given the low expression of miR-7a in male and female gonads, it is unlikely that miR7a would repress target genes and exert a biological function in testis and ovary (32) .As pre-miR-7a1 and pre-miR-7a2 are processed into an identical mature miR-7a sequence, the TaqMan probe of the miRNA assay cannot distinguish between the 2 miRNA gene products and thus measures combined miR-7a1 and miR-7a2 levels.", "claims": [{"text": "Low expression of miR7a does not repress target genes or exert a biological function in ovaries.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Low expression of miR7a does not repress target genes or exert a biological function in testis.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Low expression of miR7a does represses target genes and exerts a biological function in ovaries.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Low expression of miR7a exerts a biological function in testis.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}

During inflammation, neutrophils extravasate across the endothelium that lines the blood vessel wall through a multistep process [1, 2], which includes rolling on and subsequent firm adhesion to endothelial cells.", "citation_paragraph": "Neutrophils (also known as polymorphonuclear leukocytes or PMN), the first line of defense against intruding microorganisms, are produced in the bone marrow from stem cells that in turn proliferate and differentiate into mature neutrophils. They play an important role in host defense and contribute to inflammation-related tissue injuries. During inflammation, neutrophils extravasate across the endothelium that lines the blood vessel wall through a multistep process [1, 2] , which includes rolling on and subsequent firm adhesion to endothelial cells.Neutrophil migration through the vascular endothelial layer into lymphoid or inflamed tissues involves a dynamic regulation of cell adhesion in which new adhesions are formed at the cell's leading edge, [3] while filipodia and lamellipodia are generated as exploratory and motile projections and, coordinately, adhesions are released from the trailing edge [4] .For these events, the supply of adhesion molecules to the site of pseudopodial protrusion must be necessarily replenished in order to enable the cell to move forward. There is evidence that the membrane trafficking pathways that recycle adhesion receptors contribute to cell migration [5] , which is crucial for polarization and migration in various cell types [6] . Preferential targeting of proteins to the leading or lagging edge of migrating cells is important for polarity and chemotaxis. Asymmetric distribution of proteins has implications beyond polarity and chemotaxis because these same proteins display characteristic localization patterns when cells undergo morphological changes in general. Several proteins have been identified as contributing to cell polarity organization and subsequent inflammatory-cell migration by regulating membrane trafficking. Ly49Q directs the organization of neutrophil polarization as well as neutrophil migration to inflammation sites by regulating membrane raft functions, reorganizing neutrophils in the presence of inflammatory signals, and maintaining neutrophil homeostasis in the absence of such signals [7] . In addition, regulated exocytosis plays a crucial role in conversion of inactive, circulating neutrophils into fully activated cells capable of chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and bacterial killing [8] .Polarity gives cells morphologically and functionally distinct spatial restriction to leading and/or lagging edges by relocating certain proteins or their activities selectively to the www.intechopen.com poles. Polarization provides cells with morphological, functional, and sensitivity differences to the chemoattractant, altering the way the cell responds to a gradient. Thus, polarization generates a bipolar mechanosensory state with a dynamic leading edge for acquiring new contacts and signals, a stiff mid-body, and a sticky uropod that is dragged along the substrate and stabilizes the cell position in complex environments [9, 10] . Hence, integration of signals generated in both cellular poles leads to a coordinated movement of the leukocyte.Chemotaxis is conceptually divided into motility, directional sensing, and polarity; however, chemotaxis typically incorporates these features. Many molecules involved in chemotaxis include both lipids and proteins and are localized on the membrane or in the cortex, specifically at either the leading or the lagging edge of polarized cells.Freely diffusing chemoattractant or soluble molecular cues, known as Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMP), are liberated from damaged tissue in high abundance. DAMP include Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), bacterial peptides, heat-shock proteins, chromatin, and galectins [11] , providing short-lived or pulsatile directional information, in addition to longer-lived cues provided by constitutive or induced tissue-bound chemoattractants [11] . Beyond adhesive migration arrest, local reduction of promigratory signals is achieved by down-modulation of chemoattractant receptors, receptor desensitization, and ligand competition, whereas termination of chemoattractant activity occurs through uptake by neutralizing chemoattractant receptors and/or proteolytic degradation. After ligation, chemoattractant receptors become internalized and are either recycled to the leading edge or stored in vesicles in the uropod, thus limiting the availability of both the chemoattractant and its receptor [12] . The end result is a cascade of activation and adhesion events designed to uptake leukocytes along vessel walls, activate these for them to make stable adhesions, allow them to locomote along the endothelial surface, and to transmigrate across endothelial junctions and through the subendothelial basal lamina, guiding them onto the damage site ( Figure 1 ) [13] .

DCs move through tissues, including lymphoid organs, capturing self Ags and environmental proteins. It has been demonstrated that Ag-loaded resting/immature DCs suppress T cell activation in vivo, either via promotion of T cell deletion or by causing expansion of the regulatory T cell pool (6 -16) . Therefore, it is thought that the immune system overcomes some of the risk of developing autoimmunity and chronic inflammation by using resting/immature DCs carrying self and environmental Ags.When microbial invasion and tissue destruction occur, resting/ immature DCs that have diverse recognition systems for monitoring danger signals become activated and undergo maturation (17) (18) (19) . Activated/Mature DCs lose their Ag-capturing ability, but they acquire an Ag-presenting ability, and these DCs then migrate to the lymph nodes, where they stimulate T cells (20) . Activated/ Mature DCs also express high levels of MHC class II; costimulatory molecules such as CD86, CD80, and CD40; and cytokines such as IL-12 and TNF-\u2423 (4, 21, 22) . Understanding what controls the in vivo differentiation from resting/immature DCs to activated/ mature DCs is an important goal for vaccine development and for the prevention of unwanted immune responses, such as organ-specific autoimmune diseases.Some evidence has suggested IL-10 as a candidate factor for controlling DC differentiation in vivo, because it inhibits the activation/maturation of DCs in vitro and its overexpression suppresses DC function in vivo (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) . However, no report describes the IL-10-mediated suppression of DC maturation; such information is needed to substantiate this idea, especially for the regulation of DCs in the steady state in wild-type (WT) animals.Originally identified as a B cell differentiation factor (31, 32) , IL-6 is now known to have pleiotropic effects on cell growth, differentiation, survival, and migration during immune responses, hemopoiesis, and inflammation (33) . In addition, IL-6 affects the differentiation of myeloid lineages, including the macrophage and DC lineages, in vitro (34, 35) . Moreover, a functional defect in DCs from a myeloma patient was traced to an overproduction of IL-6 (36) . However, the effect of IL-6 on the transition between resting/immature and activated/mature DCs in vivo is currently unknown. The IL-6R consists of an \u2423-chain and gp130, which is shared among the receptors for the other IL-6 family cytokines: LIF, ciliary neurotrophic factor, oncostatin M, IL-11, and cardiotrophin-1 (33) . Binding of the IL-6 family cytokines to their receptors activates Janus kinases (JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2), leading to the recruitment of signal-transducing molecules such as Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase 2 (SHP2) (protein tyrosine phosphatase 2) and STAT3. gp130 contains six tyrosines in its cytoplasmic region. Tyr 759 is required for the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP2, and any one of four tyrosines in the C terminus (Tyr  767 , Tyr  814 , Tyr  905 , and Tyr  915 ) , which have a glutamine at position \u03e93 of the tyrosine motif (YXXQ), is required for the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 (33) . Although Tyr 759 is required for the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2 and the activation of ERK MAPK (33) , it is also suggested to have a negative role in STAT3-mediated biological actions. We previously established a series of knockin mice that lack SHP-2 MAPK, the STAT3-dependent pathway, or both. We observed that a knockin mouse lacking the SHP-2 MAPK pathway (named the gp130 F759/F759 mouse) has splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy from an early age (37) .In this study, we analyzed the role of IL-6 on DC activation/ maturation in vivo, using several mutant mice, including the IL-6 knockout (IL-6 KO) and gp130 knockin mice. We demonstrate that the DC differentiation process in vivo was affected by the activity of the IL-6 signaling pathway. IL-6 signaling increased the number of resting/immature DCs and decreased the number of activated/mature DCs in the lymph nodes; it also decreased the number of activated/mature DCs in the spleen, following LPS stimulation. In addition, we found that STAT3 was required for the IL-6-mediated suppression of LPS-induced DC activation/maturation. DC-dependent T cell activation was enhanced in IL-6 KO, but suppressed in gp130 F759/F759 mice, in which gp130-mediated STAT3 activation is enhanced.

Pneumococcal infection is initiated by bacterial adherence to lung epithelial cells. The exact transcriptional changes occurring in both host and microbe during infection are unknown. Here, we developed a time-resolved infection model of human lung alveolar epithelial cells by S. pneumoniae and assess the resulting transcriptome changes in both organisms simultaneously by using dual RNA-seq.   RESULTS Functional analysis of the time-resolved dual RNA-seq data identifies several features of pneumococcal infection. For instance, we show that the glutathione-dependent reactive oxygen detoxification pathway in epithelial cells is activated by reactive oxygen species produced by S. pneumoniae. Addition of the antioxidant resveratrol during infection abates this response. At the same time, pneumococci activate the competence regulon during co-incubation with lung epithelial cells. By comparing transcriptional changes between wild-type encapsulated and mutant unencapsulated pneumococci, we demonstrate that adherent pneumococci, but not free-floating bacteria, repress innate immune responses in epithelial cells including expression of the chemokine IL-8 and the production of antimicrobial peptides. We also show that pneumococci activate several sugar transporters in response to adherence to epithelial cells and demonstrate that this activation depends on host-derived mucins.   CONCLUSIONS We provide a dual-transcriptomics overview of early pneumococcal infection in a time-resolved manner, providing new insights into host-microbe interactions. To allow easy access to the data by the community, a web-based platform was developed ( http://dualrnaseq.molgenrug.nl ). Further database exploration may expand our understanding of epithelial-pneumococcal interaction, leading to novel antimicrobial strategies.", "citation_paragraph": "The model used here could be expanded further by incorporating relevant LRTI agents. For example, alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells together form the epithelium lining the lower respiratory tract. The cells reciprocally influence cellular phenotypes and behaviors [66] , highly relevant to infection. Moreover, pneumococcal coinfection and secondary infection with, for instance, influenza virus or H. influenzae are not unheard of [67] [68] [69] . Incorporation of other agents into the model and exploiting dual (or triple and quadruple) RNA-seq approaches may provide novel insights into respiratory infection.Besides its relevance in communicable diseases, gained insights into pneumococcal infection are also applicable to understanding several non-communicable respiratory diseases. Asthma, the most common chronic respiratory disease, is a major risk factor for pneumococcal infection [70] . Additionally, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [71] and cigarette smoking [72] have been reported to increase the risk of pneumococcal LRTI. Here, we report the first study to show simultaneous transcriptomic changes of the pathogen S. pneumoniae and human lung alveolar epithelial cells during early infection, which might aid in identifying new biomarkers and drug targets to combat infection.Though transcriptome rewiring is a focal point during interspecies interaction [22, 23] , non-transcriptional regulation plays an important part during early infection. Capsule shedding, a hallmark of pneumococcal infection, is regulated by autolysin-A (LytA). LytA is activated when the bacterium encounters alveolar cathelicidin [17] , which is independent of transcriptional regulation. Heterogeneity of cellular responses is another confounding factor [73] . Recently, dual RNA-seq combined with cell sorting was used to identify heterogeneous activity of Salmonella virulence factors that, in turn, drives a heterogeneous interferon response in macrophages [74] . This highlights the relevance of noise in gene expression and cell-to-cell variability in host-pathogen interactions. Furthermore, whole organism infection models offer a more systemic perspective. For instance, the dual RNA-seq approach has been used to monitor infection of wheat by bacteria [75] and mosquitoes by filaria [76] .

Although archaea are as bacteria prokaryotes, they form a distinct domain having unique features such as different cell wall structures and membrane lipids. So far, no microbe-associated molecular patterns of archaea which activate innate immune receptors have been identified. By stimulating human myeloid cells with M. stadtmanae and purified archaeal nucleic acids, we identified both the microorganism and its RNA as potent stimuli for the innate immune system. To dissect the recognition and activation pathways induced by M. stadtmanae, human monocytic BLaER1 knockout cells were generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system targeting components of TLR and inflammasome signaling. While the recognition of M. stadtmanae is mediated by TLR7 and TLR8, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome depends solely on TLR8 engagement. Notably, this process resembles hallmarks of both the canonical and the recently described alternative inflammasome activation. Thus, we have demonstrated for the first time the specific recognition of and response to an archaeon by human cells at the molecular level.", "citation_paragraph": "Only recently have researchers begun to appreciate the full diversity of our microbiome and to include genetic data from other domains (17) . Due to methodological challenges (36) , the function and influence of archaea on the human immune system have yet to be determined and, the exact mechanism by which M. stadtmanae induces inflammation remains unknown. Although much is known of the molecular interactions involved in bacterial-induced inflammation, these findings are not immediately applicable to the detection of archaea by immune cells: bacteria and archaea are genetically and structurally different. In particular, the various archaeal cell wall structures and membrane lipids are very different from those of bacteria [e.g., the methanoarchaea M. stadtmanae and Methanobrevibacter smithii do not engage NOD2, TLR2, or TLR4 (19)], and their translation and transcription machineries resemble eukaryotic processes (26) . Here, we describe for the first time the key archaeal MAMP, in the form of M. stadtmanae RNA which is recognized by human immune cells through TLR8 and, to a lesser extent, through TLR7.We consider activation of human myeloid cells by M. stadtmanae to be reminiscent of antiviral characteristics, as it induces the gene expression of type-I and type-III IFNs and the translocation of IRF1 and IRF5 into the nucleus. The cytokine response is completely dependent on MyD88 and UNC93B1 but not on TRIF-these findings indicate the involvement of nucleic acids, specifically ssRNA, in the recognition process.

Both receptors concurrently recognize single nucleotides and short oligonucleotides (2-3mers), which should be present in all fractions of RNA from M. stadtmanae. This mechanism appears to be promiscuous and capable of recognizing a wide range of organisms; thus, it is not restricted to bacteria but likely involved in the recognition of viruses, and presumably other archaeal species besides M. stadtmanae. In BLaER1 monocytes, the recognition of M. stadtmanae is mediated primarily by TLR8 and to a lesser extent by TLR7. Notably, the induction of IFN-\u03b114 and IFN-\u03bb1 as well as the secretion of IL-1\u03b2 is fully dependent on TLR8. This difference in receptor involvement might be due to the unequal expression of the two receptors, as TLR8 rather than TLR7 seems to be the predominant receptor in human monocytes (44) . Additionally, TLR8 and TLR9 seem to outperform TLR7 in terms of UNC93B1-mediated trafficking to the endosomes (45) , which may explain the stronger influence of TLR8 on M. stadtmanae-induced secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6. We demonstrated that in addition to inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and IFNs, M. stadtmanae also potently activates the NLRP3 inflammasome. As secretion of IL-1\u03b2 is completely lost in NLRP3 \u2212/\u2212 cells, it clearly indicates that the NLRP3 inflammasome is the essential executor activated by M. stadtmanae. The contribution of other inflammasome complexes (e.g., in priming steps), however, cannot be completely ruled out. With the use of inhibitors and BLaER1 KO monocytes, we revealed that inflammasome activation is TLR8-dependent and RNA-mediated. This process is most likely related to the activation process induced by bacterial RNA, which was also shown to trigger the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to caspase-1 activation and the conversion of pro-IL-1\u03b2 into its active form (46, 47) . However, the process of M. stadtmanae-induced inflammasome activation differs from classical activation pathways, namely, canonical and non-canonical activation, which both lead to the formation of ASC specks and cell death after short stimulation times (48) . In the case of M. stadtmanae, inflammasome activation is delayed compared with classical NLRP3 activation (e.g., by LPS/nigericin stimulation). Furthermore, M. stadtmanae did not induce ASC speck formation in BLaER1 monocytes, although IL-1\u03b2 was clearly present in the supernatant after 18 h. This activation resembles the recently described process of alternative inflammasome activation (29) . However, in contrast to this TLR4-and TRIF-dependent alternative activation, M. stadtmanae induces TLR8-dependent inflammasome activation and TLR8-and NLRP3-dependent cell death, known as pyroptosis, independently of TRIF. Furthermore, we detected LDH release after stimulation with LPS alone. One possible explanation is that this mechanism is caspase-4-mediated, as Gaidt et al. used caspase-4 \u2212/\u2212 BLaER1 monocytes as control cells. Given that TLR8, but not TLR7, is involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by the NADPH oxidase NOX2 complex in human neutrophils (49) and a relationship between the NLRP3 inflammasome and NOX2 was previously demonstrated in relation to phagosomal acidification (50), we hypothesize that M. stadtmanae-induced TLR8-dependent NLRP3 activation is associated with the production of ROS (51) . ROS production might provide a necessary signal for inflammasome activation, especially as these reactive intermediates can serve as an NEK7-mediated activation signal of the NLRP3 inflammasome (52) . Thus, ROS may provide a feasible mechanism promoting M. stadtmanae-induced NLRP3 activation. Using BLaER1 NEK7\u2212/\u2212 monocytes, we were able to confirm the involvement of NEK7 in M. stadtmanae-induced cytokine production, although this phenotypic loss was not as strong as that observed in cells lacking ASC, Caspase-1, NLRP3, or TLR8. As a result, the detailed mechanism of how NEK and ROS influence NLRP3 activation will require further clarification.The findings regarding the interaction between the methanogenic archaeon M. stadtmanae and human immune cells indicate that archaea represent an important part of our microbiota. There is a great need for further investigation of human-associated archaea, if one considers that many inflammatory diseases are associated with both the inflammasome (53, 54) and the composition of the microbiota (3). As we identified M. stadtmanae as a strong activator of pro-inflammatory immune responses in vitro, it is conceivable that it could also contribute to an over-activation of the inflammasome in vivo. Therefore, future studies should adapt their experimental design to consider these important components of our microbiota and better understand the involvement of archaea in the development of inflammatory diseases such as IBD and lung hypersensitivity, and thus shape possible treatment approaches.", "citance": "Furthermore, M. stadtmanae did not induce ASC speck formation in BLaER1 monocytes, although IL-1\u03b2 was clearly present in the supernatant after 18 h.

{"s2orc_id": 8444307, "title": "NAMPT-Mediated Salvage Synthesis of NAD+ Controls Morphofunctional Changes of Macrophages", "abstract": "Functional morphodynamic behavior of differentiated macrophages is strongly controlled by actin cytoskeleton rearrangements, a process in which also metabolic cofactors ATP and NAD(H) (i.e. NAD+ and NADH) and NADP(H) (i.e. NADP+ and NADPH) play an essential role. Whereas the link to intracellular ATP availability has been studied extensively, much less is known about the relationship between actin cytoskeleton dynamics and intracellular redox state and NAD+-supply. Here, we focus on the role of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), found in extracellular form as a cytokine and growth factor, and in intracellular form as one of the key enzymes for the production of NAD+ in macrophages. Inhibition of NAD+ salvage synthesis by the NAMPT-specific drug FK866 caused a decrease in cytosolic NAD+ levels in RAW 264.7 and Maf-DKO macrophages and led to significant downregulation of the glycolytic flux without directly affecting cell viability, proliferation, ATP production capacity or mitochondrial respiratory activity. Concomitant with these differential metabolic changes, the capacity for phagocytic ingestion of particles and also substrate adhesion of macrophages were altered. Depletion of cytoplasmic NAD+ induced cell-morphological changes and impaired early adhesion in phagocytosis of zymosan particles as well as spreading performance. Restoration of NAD+ levels by NAD+, NMN, or NADP+ supplementation reversed the inhibitory effects of FK866. We conclude that direct coupling to local, actin-based, cytoskeletal dynamics is an important aspect of NAD+'s cytosolic role in the regulation of morphofunctional characteristics of macrophages.", "citation_paragraph": "Macrophage function involves efficient migration into tissues, adhesion to the extracellular matrix, probing or sampling of their extracellular environment via filopodia, and -most importantlyphagocytosis of the pathogens and foreign particles they encounter. These processes rely on proper regulation of polymerization and depolymerization, branching and debranching of the actin cytoskeleton and on adequate cellular ATP supply, but the precise metabolic requirements and mechanisms involved are not yet fully understood. The NAD + biosynthetic enzyme NAMPT has been implicated in linking NAD + metabolism and the inflammatory cytokine response of monocytes and macrophages and to play a regulatory role in cancer cell motility [30] [31] [32] [33] . Here we have investigated the importance of NAMPT dependent NAD + synthesis for the actin driven processes of adhesion and spreading and phagocytosis in macrophages. As a novel finding we report that these morphofunctional activities depended heavily on NAD + availability, even under metabolic conditions whereby cell growth and viability and intracellular ATP levels appeared not (yet!) affected. How these metabolic and morphodynamic activities are mechanistically controlled remains to be further investigated, but possibilities are discussed further below and graphically summarized in Figure 8 .Although the biosynthetic pathways involved in the synthesis of NAD(H) and NADP(H) are generally quite well conserved in mammalian cells, their synthetic capacity and also the intracellular levels of NAD(H) and NADP(H) may differ dramatically between cell types [21, 61] . NAD + can be produced via de novo synthesis from tryptophan or via three salvage pathways. It also serves as precursor for the other three pyridine nucleotides, NADH, NADP + , and NADPH. Its reduced form, NADH, is produced in reactions catalyzed by dehydrogenases (mainly by LDH and in the TCA cycle) while NADP + is synthesized through the phosphorylation of NAD + by NAD kinase (NADK). NADP + is subsequently and very quickly reduced, so that cellular NADP(H) occurs mostly as NADPH [62] . In contrast, cellular NAD(H) occurs mainly in the oxidized form, i.e. NAD + . Our measurements shown in Figure 1 confirm that this general picture also holds for RAW 264.7 and Maf-DKO macrophages. However, one striking observation was that RAW 264.7 cells contain remarkably high levels of NADP(H) and appear to maintain these levels during and NADH were totally depleted while 40% of the cellular NADPH still remained. That cellular NAD(H) is more sensitive to NAMPT inhibition by FK866 was also observed for the Maf-DKO cell line and for U251 glioma cells and activated T cells in previous studies [33, 63] . Although the mitochondrial NAD(P)(H)-pool was not left completely untouched, it was clearly less sensitive to NAMPT inhibition. More importantly, FK866-mediated NAMPT inhibition did not noticeably affect mitochondrial respiration. Multiple divergent explanations are possible for these combined observations. Firstly, mitochondria may not be solely dependent on NAMPT activity to build up a pool of NAD + . Some studies show that these organelles do not even contain NAMPT themselves, although this is an issue of some controversy [49, 64] . According to Nikiforov et al. [50] , NMNAT3 is the only enzyme of NAD + synthesis in mitochondria of human cells. This enzyme uses NMN, formed by cleavage of cytosolic NAD + , as substrate for intramitochondrial synthesis of NAD + . However, a more recent study by Felici et al. [51] contradicts these assertions showing that cytosolic NAD + maintains the mitochondrial NAD + pool and that neither NMNAT3v1 nor its splice variant FKSG76 is detectable in human cells. Moreover, upon of transfection of NMNAT3v1, FKSG76 was the isoform found to be localized to the mitochondria but to be involved in NAD + splicing rather than synthesis. What remains, is that the mitochondrial NAD(P)(H) pool in our macrophage model cells reacts differently, but appears not to be completely separated from the cytosolic pool. Therefore, the reduction in mitochondrial autofluorescence signal ( Figure 2D ) can be best explained as an effect of a drop in cytosolic NAD + . The global NAD + depletion after 24 hours resulted in a reduced glycolytic rate but the cells nevertheless managed to maintain cellular ATP production. How this is accomplished is currently not completely clear to us. Recently Tan et al. [65] , showed that FK866 treatment of cancer cells led to an attenuation of glycolysis at the GAPDH reaction resulting in a carbon overflow into the pentose phosphate pathway, a reduced carbon flow into the TCA cycle, and eventually a reduction in cellular ATP. They also showed that the inhibitory effect on the TCA cycle was less when glutamine was not limiting in the culture medium. Since our cells were cultured in the presence of glutamine and glycolysis was clearly inhibited, glutamine consumption may have been upregulated in the presence of FK866. Upon glutaminolysis, glutamine is converted into pyruvate and, finally, lactate via the formation of TCA-cycle intermediates a-ketogluterate, succinate, fumarate, and malate, yielding NADH and FADH 2 for ATP production via OXPHOS. This could also explain the minor increase in lactate formation from 1.5 to 1.8 moles of lactate per mole of glucose consumed (ratio of bars, Figure 2A , B). We did not observe any increase in basal mitochondrial OXPHOS activity ( Figure 2E ), however, indicating that ATP production was not significantly upregulated via this route. Thus, any increase in glutaminolysis probably only matched the reduced carbon flow from glycolysis into the TCA cycle but did not contribute to ATP homeostasis.Can we thus rule out limited availability of ATP, due to lack of NAD + , as the cause of morphofunctional change in FK866 treated macrophages? Earlier we showed that microcompartmentation of ATP-supply plays a role in the control of cell migratory activity of cells [66] . It remains therefore possible that FK866-mediated NAD + reduction is associated with a local change in ATP supply capacity, which may be not sufficient to meet the highly variable and transient demand for cytoskeletal remodeling and phagocytosis. Under these conditions global cellular ATP concentrations may not be overtly affected. Interestingly, after 3 hours of NAMPT inhibition still no inhibitory effect was observed on either + is required to sustain high glycolytic activity in macrophages. Metabolism of glucose yields cellular ATP which is loaded onto Gactin monomers by profilin before incorporation into an actin filament, or used to activate the Arp2/3 complex. ATP also binds to Rho GTPase Rho A, which in turn also stimulates actin polymerization (pink arrows). LPS stimulation induces the expression of the NAD + synthesizing enzyme NAMPT (turquoise arrows). NAMPT-mediated NAD + synthesis may regulate actin dynamics by activating Cdc42 (green arrows) or by influencing cellular metabolism and, thereby, intracellular pH and cofilin activity (purple arrows). Alternatively, NAMPT may control redox regulation of the actin cytoskeleton via mical or NADPH oxidase by regulating NADPH levels (orange arrows).

In addition, the accumulated glucose consumption and lactate production over the entire 24 hour incubation period was not significantly different for control and FK866 treated cells (results not shown). The decrease in glycolytic flux only became substantial towards the end of the 24 hour treatment (Figure 2A, B) . Thus, if metabolic coupling of NAD + concentration to local or global ATP supply is not the primary mechanism that accounts for FK866 effects on macrophage morphodynamics, what other mechanisms could be involved?Apart from limiting the ATP supply, NAD + -depletion may have other metabolic consequences that could (directly or indirectly) interfere with actin dependent morphodynamics. For example, the production of lactate in the last step of glycolysis, together with release of protons from the conversion of NADH to NAD + , influences global intracellular pH (pHi). Locally, the lactate molecules, when transported out of the cell by the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT1) together with the H + [67, 68] , form a pH gradient across the membrane, which is thought to induce cytoskeletal rearrangement via actin-binding proteins gelsolin, cofilin, and talin [69] . By inhibiting the glycolytic flux to lactate, NAD + -depletion may thus exert direct effects on global and local pH homeostasis. In line with this, we have recently shown that both the pHi and the pericellular pH (pHe) of FK866 treated and NAMPT knockdown U251 cells were elevated compared to control cells and that the addition of lactic acid to culture media restored the inhibitory effect of FK866 on U251-shNAMPT cell migration [33] . Whether [NAD + ] changes also cause shifts in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in macrophages, and thereby affect the remodeling of the acto-myosin cytoskeleton in the micro-environment of phagocytic cup formation remains a topic for further study.Upon stimulation with LPS, macrophages undergo dynamic morphological changes and reorganization of their actin cytoskeleton [8, 9] . LPS forms a complex with LPS binding protein (LBP) present in serum, binds to CD14, and finally to the TLR4/MD-2 complex on the macrophage cell membrane [70, 71] . LPS signaling via TLR4 induces Src family kinase mediated phosphorylation of Pyk2 and paxillin [8, 9, 72] as well as phosphorylation of the PI3K/AKT pathway [73] . These are molecules acting upstream of the small GTPases Rho, Rac and Cdc42 which regulate stress fiber, lamellipodia and membrane ruffle, and filopodia formation, respectively [74] [75] [76] . As a consequence, LPS stimulation induces cell spreading and the formation of protrusive membrane structures. In addition, LPS is responsible for the activation of the complement receptor (CR3) that is involved in the recognition of serum opsonized particles via Rap1 and RhoA [77, 78] . Together, this enhances the phagocytic capacity of macrophages. We observed here that NAD + -depletion upon NAMPT inhibition markedly reduced the phagocytic capacity of RAW 264.7 and Maf-DKO cells, even though they were still able to internalize particles once these were bound. Recently, NAMPT was shown to regulate directionally persistent migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs), mediated by Cdc42 activation [79] . Although Cdc42 has been implicated in IgGmediated and not CR3-mediated phagocytosis [80] , it is also involved in filopodia formation, the assembly of multimolecular focal complexes [76] , and in integrin-mediated adhesion and spreading [81] by regulating actin network reorganization via LIMK2-mediated phosphorylation/inactivation of cofilin [82] . This, in combination with the knowledge that phagocytosis is an area-restricted form of cell adhesion and spreading [57] , suggests that our findings can also be explained by direct NAMPT activity effects on the Cdc42-mediated probing, particle capturing, and adhesion activity of macrophages.Finally, yet another determinant of proper actin cytoskeletal remodeling is cellular redox state [53, 54] , in which NAD + /NADH and NADP + /NADPH play an important role. In macrophages, cellular NADPH may influence redox regulation of actin remodeling in several ways. Professional phagocytes express NADPH oxidases (NOX) which use NADPH to transfer an electron to molecular oxygen during the respiratory burst. This gives rise to superoxide which can further be converted into hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) and other reactive oxygen species (ROS), both intra-and extracellularly. Extracellularly and in the phagosomal lumen, these ROS serve a microbicidal function, thereby offering protection against pathogens. Intracellularly, the ROS is involved in redox signaling, mediating the production of cytokines via NFkb-dependent mechanisms [83] but also regulating the activity of cofilin [84] which increases the recycling of actin monomers at the pointed end of actin filaments. At the same time, NADPH is also responsible for the regeneration of antioxidant molecules such as glutathione (GSH) and thioredoxin (Trx), thereby offering protection against oxidative stress, which may affect the redox state of actin itself [85] . NADPH may also regulate the balance between ROS-mediated activation/deactivation of signaling molecules (GTPases) that control the actin cytoskeleton [54] . Furthermore, NADPH is required for the disassembly of actin filaments by MICAL redox enzymes [86] which have been shown to regulate actin dynamics in many cell types [87] [88] [89] [90] , including macrophages [91] . Our findings suggest that NADP(H) may even be a principal pyridine nucleotide in coupling NAD + -metabolism to actin-based morphodynamics, based on the following arguments: i) RAW 264.7 cells have a relatively high level of cellular NADPH, ii) NADP(H) levels were relatively spared during the initial phases of FK866 inhibition and -in associationmorpho-functional changes became only apparent at later time points when cellular NADPH reached critical levels, i.e. after 6, 15, or 24 hours of NAMPT inhibition, and finally, iii) supplementation with NADP + quite effectively rescued phagocytosis in FK866 treated cells (Figure 7) .Studies during the last decade have identified FK866 as a promising drug against many different cancers. Currently, this compound is being tested in phase two clinical trials [92] [93] [94] . Tumor cells are more sensitive to inhibition of NAD + synthesis than normal cells since they are metabolically highly glycolytic and, therefore, FK866 is an effective inhibitor of tumor cell growth. Earlier we have shown in glioma cells [33] , and here now also in macrophages, that morphodynamic behavior (motility, phagocytosis, spreading) is significantly inhibited at moderately effective FK866 concentrations, during treatment periods wherein proliferation and viability were not yet affected. When extrapolating these findings to the in vivo situation, we expect that the magnitude of effects of FK866 will be dependent on a tumor-cell's nutrient state and its capacity for NAD + synthesis via different metabolic pathways (i.e. via de novo or salvage pathways, via NAPRT or NAMPT). Treatment with FK866 may thus have broad consequences, particularly also for normal glycolytic cells in tumors such as macrophages. For example, our findings thus leave open the possibility that FK866 could affect the morphodynamics of tumor associated macrophages (TAMs), which have a promoting role in tumor cell migration [95] , tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis [96] . From a treatment perspective, this could help to further enhance FK866's anti-cancer effect. On the other hand, FK866 treatment could have adverse effects and lead to an overall repression of macrophage migratory and phagocytic function, with less clearance of apoptotic cells and debris from dying tumors. These effects -even in a more broader sense -are also a point of concern for use of FK866 as antiinflammatory drug for the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, or Crohn's disease. Further study in patients and animal models in vivo is, therefore, necessary to fully understand all possible consequences of FK866 treatment regimes.In summary, we report here that FK866 mediated inhibition of NAMPT causes NAD + -depletion and down regulation of glycolysis in macrophage model cells. Inhibition of NAD + salvage synthesis did not affect cell viability, proliferative capacity, or ATP levels but significantly impaired morphofunctional changes involved in phagocytosis and spreading. Future research should elucidate how NAD + production and these processes are exactly linked.

The tau pathology burden correlates with neurodegeneration and dementia observed in these diseases. The microtubule binding domain of tau is essential for its physiological functions in promoting neuronal cytoskeletal stability, however it is also required for tau to assemble into an amyloid structure that comprises pathological inclusions. A series of novel monoclonal antibodies were generated which recognize the second and fourth microtubule-binding repeat domain of tau, thus enabling the identification specifically of 4-repeat tau versus 3-/4-repeat tau, respectively. These antibodies are highly specific for tau and recognize pathological tau inclusions in human tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy and in transgenic mouse models of tauopathies. These new antibodies will be useful for identifying and characterizing different tauopathies and as tools to target tau pathology in these diseases.", "citation_paragraph": "Tauopathies are a group of neurodegenerative diseases predominantly identifiable by inclusions composed of aggregated, highly phosphorylated and cleaved microtubule (MT)-associated protein tau (MAPT) [1] . This burden of tau inclusion pathology has been shown to correlate with the cognitive decline observed in these diseases, as well as, neurodegeneration [2] [3] [4] . Indeed, cognitive decline associates more with the tau burden compared to the amyloid-\u03b2 load in Alzheimer's disease (AD) [5] . Tauopathies are pathologically and symptomatically heterogeneous and include AD, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), Pick's disease, and frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome [1, 6] .In brain, tau exists as six different isoforms, ranging from 352 to 441 amino acids in length as a result of alternative splicing of exons 2, 3 and 10 [7] [8] [9] and is natively unfolded [10] . a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111Specifically, alternative splicing of exon 10 leads to the exclusion or inclusion of the second MT binding repeat (R2), producing tau isoforms with either 3 (3R) or 4 (4R) MT repeats, respectively [1, 6, 11] . Inclusion of exons 2 and 3 results in tau isoforms with N-terminal inserts termed N1 and N2, respectively [11, 12] . Tau expression is developmentally regulated; human fetal brain expresses only the shortest tau isoform (0N3R) whereas in healthy adult brain equal amounts of 3R and 4R tau are expressed [12, 13] . In disease, differences between 3R and 4R tau amounts can exist. Some FTDP-17 mutations increase the ratio of 4R to 3R tau and insoluble tau purified from these cases are largely 4R tau [1, 6, 13] , similar to findings observed in PSP and CBD [14] . PiD, on the other hand shows increased 3R to 4R tau ratio [14] and in AD, equivalent amounts of both isoforms are found [15] .The MT binding domain (MTBD) of tau enables it to bind, assemble and stabilize MTs, promoting neuronal stability [1, 6, 11, [16] [17] [18] . The number of MT repeats (3R or 4R) in tau can affect the speed of axonal transport [19] , and the presence of 4 MTBDs increases the propensity of tau to form \u03b2-sheets and aggregate [20] . The MTBD is the core domain required to drive amyloid structure formation and aggregation [21] . Phosphorylation in the MTBD decreases the affinity of tau for MTs [22] and may contribute to the accumulation of unbound tau in pathological inclusions.Identifying 3R and 4R tau is relevant as pathological markers to distinguish between tauopathies and targeting the MT-binding repeat domain of tau is of interest for immunotherapy.

{"s2orc_id": 25885954, "title": "Antibiotics active against Chlamydia do not reduce the risk of myocardial infarction", "abstract": "There is evidence that Chlamydia pneumoniae (CP) is involved in the aetiology of myocardial infarction (MI). Randomised trials do not support a beneficial effect of antibiotics in secondary prevention of MI, but the evidence for an effect on primary prevention is conflicting. We investigated if past use of antibiotics active against CP is associated with a decreased risk of developing MI. We conducted a population-based case-control study of 4166 patients hospitalised due to MI from 1 January 1994 to 1 September 1999 in the County of Funen, Denmark. Controls (n=16,664) were a random sample of inhabitants, matched for age and sex. Confounders controlled for in the analysis were gender, age, obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, previous MI and known atherosclerotic antecedents. Previous use of antibiotics active against CP (macrolides, tetracyclines and quinolones) and of antibiotics not active against CP (penicillins) was analysed among the cases and controls. The risk of MI was not associated with previous exposure to macrolides (OR: 1.0; CI: 0.9\u20131.1), tetracyclines (OR: 1.0; CI: 0.9\u20131.2) or quinolones (OR: 1.0; CI: 0.9\u20131.2) or combinations of the three drugs (OR: 1.0; CI: 0.9\u20131.1). There was no sign of a protective effect in subgroups defined by high cumulative doses of antibiotics, various time-windows of exposure, risk factors of MI or other co-morbidity. OR was 1.1 (0.9\u20131.3) in persons with no atherosclerotic antecedents. The study does not support the hypothesis of a decreased risk of MI in patients exposed to antibiotics active against CP.", "citation_paragraph": "This study does not support the hypothesis of a decreased risk of MI in patients exposed to antibiotics active against Chlamydia. No protective effect was found for macrolides, tetracyclines or quinolones or for the three agents combined. The absence of association was found across a very broad range of subgroups defined by earlier MI, ischaemic heart disease, atherosclerosis, diabetes, various antibiotic doses, different time-windows for exposure, various definitions of antibiotic exposure and for CP non-active antibiotics. It is thus unlikely that a positive effect in certain subgroups would be concealed by an overall null-effect.A strength of using OPED is that it is based on the whole population, covering all inhabitants of the County of Funen, which corresponds to about 10% of the Danish population. It is unlikely that a true protective effect has been missed due to a lack of statistical power. With a total of more than 4000 cases, a case-control ratio of 1:4 and a prevalence of exposure to antibiotics active against Chlamydia among the controls of more than 10%, the power of the analysis was more than 90% (at a 95% confidence interval) to detect a 20% reduction in risk associated with antibiotic use. Among studies published to date, this study has included the largest number of MI cases and, accordingly, we can present narrow confidence intervals.Information about hospital discharge diagnoses were obtained from a HDR. The quality of hospital discharge diagnoses may vary, and for some diagnoses, e.g. hypertension, Danish studies have found a considerable misclassification bias [29] . However, when focusing on the diagnosis MI, Danish studies have shown a high validity of the Danish HDR [30] . We examined discharge reports in a random sample of 500 cases and found that the computerrecorded diagnosis was confirmed in 94% of the cases. Information about exposure to antibiotics was obtained from a prescription database (OPED) covering all subsidised prescriptions. The exposure may have been overestimated if the patients did not take antibiotics according to the prescription issued. In Denmark, the use of quinolones and tetracyclines in the primary health care is very limited and, in addition, data on these drugs were incomplete because they were not subsidised during the entire study period [25] . This may have introduced a nondifferential misclassification of exposure, leading to a bias towards the null hypothesis. A slightly or moderately reduced sensitivity of the exposure measure, as in our case, will only produce a small bias towards the null [31] . Since most of our point estimates were above unity, this source of error cannot have masked a true protective effect.5 Risk of MI related to the cumulated defined daily dose (DDD) of antibiotics active against Chlamydia (macrolide, tetracycline and quinoloneSmoking would be expected to exert a confounding effect on the association between antibiotics active against CP and MI, since smoking is a risk factor for both MI and COPD, and patients with COPD have more frequent respiratory tract infections than others [32] . This bias would increase the OR, thereby masking a possible protective effect of antibiotics active against CP. Unfortunately, we did not have data on the smoking habits of our subjects. On the other hand, smoking not complicated by COPD is unlikely to substantially increase the use of antibiotics. Thus, by using COPD as a proxy for smoking, we have essentially captured the confounding effect of smoking. Another potential confounder not accounted for in our data is low socio-economic status, which is a risk factor for MI [33, 34] and may also be related to antibiotic consumption [35] . However, if a true protective effect of antibiotics active against CP had been masked by smoking and low socio-economic status, we would have found a higher OR for penicillin than for antibiotics active against CP. Both of these confounders would also be expected to operate in the association between penicillin and MI.Our study was based on patients admitted to hospital for MI, and it did not include patients that did not reach hospital. Extrapolation of our results to patients outside the hospital should be done with caution. However, it seems unlikely that Chlamydia active antibiotics would reduce the risk of MI only for patients outside hospital. Another limitation is the lack of information about levels of antibody against CP. Our study population is assumed to include both subjects with and without previous infection with CP. If cases and controls were characterised by their antibody titres, it would have been possible to stratify the analysis and thereby focus on the potential effect of antibiotics active against Chlamydia in patients with Chlamydia infection.Our findings are consistent with the results from a casecontrol study by Jackson et al. [21] who compared 1796 cases of MI with 4882 controls and found no association between the use of erythromycin, tetracycline or doxycycline and the risk of MI. Our findings are also consistent with results from the population-based cohort study of 354,258 individuals by Luchsinger et al. [22] who found that use of antibiotics active against Chlamydia did not reduce the risk of MI in the general population. Furthermore, our results are consistent with the report from Meier et al. [17] who compared 3315 cases of MI with 13,315 controls and found no protective effect of macrolides. Contrary to our findings, Meier et al. found a protective effect for tetracycline and quinolones. Our results are consistent with the report from Herings et al. [23] who compared 628 cases of MI with 1615 controls and found no protective effect for tetracyclines and macrolides, even if given these were administered in high doses or multiple courses.A Danish cohort study compared the risk of hospitalisation for cardiovascular diseases in a group of 60-to 69-year-old individuals exposed to macrolides or penicillin [36] . In the first 3 months after exposure users of macrolide had a lower risk of admittance compared with users of penicillin, but the difference disappeared after 3 months. Only 49 episodes of MI were recorded, and there was no significant difference in the risk of MI among users of penicillin and macrolide.In conclusion, our results did not support the hypothesis that use of antibiotics active against Chlamydia reduces the risk of MI. However, it should be emphasised that C. pneumoniae may play a causal role in the atherosclerotic process but that the risk of MI may not be modified by the type and doses of antibiotics used in this study. Only 3% of the patients were prescribed a cumulated dose of more than 30 DDD of antibiotics active against Chlamydia in the 3-year period immediately preceding index date. The exposure to antibiotics active against Chlamydia in daily practice may thus be insufficient for a risk reduction of MI. Furthermore, some of the antibiotics prescribed may not have been consumed as prescribed.Our study indicates that treatment with antibiotics active against Chlamydia in doses and duration commonly prescribed in Denmark does not reduce the risk of MI.", "citance": "Furthermore, our results are consistent with the report from Meier et al.

Here we demonstrate that the microRNA-103/107(miR-103/107) family, which is preferentially expressed in the stem cell-enriched limbal epithelium, coordinately regulates aspects of both these activities. Loss of miR-103/107 causes dysregulation of macropinocytosis with the formation of large vacuoles, primarily through up-regulation of Src, Ras, and Ankfy1.

We found in a yeast two-hybrid screen that c-Maf can interact with Ubc9 and PIAS1, two key enzymes of the SUMOylation pathway. In this study, we report that c-Maf co-localized with these two SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) ligases in the nucleus and that c-Maf can be SUMOylated in vitro and also in primary Th2 cells. We also demonstrated that lysine-33 is the dominant, if not the only, SUMO acceptor site of c-Maf. SUMOylation of c-Maf attenuated its transcriptional activity. Reciprocally, a SUMOylation resistant c-Maf was more potent than WT-c-Maf in driving IL-4 production in c-Maf-deficient Th2 cells. Furthermore, we showed that ablation of the SUMO site did not alter the subcellular localization or the stability of c-Maf protein but instead enhanced its recruitment to the Il4-promoter. We conclude that SUMOylation at lysine-33 is a functionally critical post-translational modification event of c-Maf in Th cells.", "citation_paragraph": "In this report, we show that c-Maf is post-translationally modified by SUMO molecules. We also identify K33 as the dominant, if not the only, acceptor site for SUMO and demonstrate that conjugating with SUMO suppresses the transcription activity of c-Maf. Moreover, SUMOylation-resistant c-Maf is more easily recruited to the Il4-promoter. Therefore, SUMOylation of c-Maf interferes with its recruitment to the Il4-promoter, thereby negatively regulating the production of IL-4.Our data also lend support to the notion that the function of large Maf proteins is tightly regulated by post-translational modifications. It has been shown that phosphorylation of v-Maf by GSK3 kinase enhances its transforming activity. MafA and MafB, two large Maf proteins, can be phosphorylated by P38 MAP kinase [23, 24] . Phosphorylation of MafA enhances its ubiquitination and increases the recruitment of coactivator P/CAF by MafA [9] . Prior to this report, MafB and MafA have been shown to be modified by SUMO [22] . MafA can be SUMOylated by SUMO-1 and SUMO-2 on lysine 32 residue, and SUMO modification is triggered by hypoglycemia or by oxidative stress. MafB is reported to be SUMOylated by SUMO-1 on lysine 32 and 297 residues via v-myb signaling. It is intriguing that these three Maf proteins use a consensus site in the AD for their SUMOylation, i.e. the lysine 33 residue of c-Maf, and the lysine 32 residue of MafA and MafB. In addition, the effects of SUMOylation on these three Maf proteins are all negative. SUMOylation of MafA decreases its transcriptional activity on the insulin promoter and intensifies the suppression of CHOP10 expression [23] . SUMO modification suppresses MafB to promote macrophage differentiation and inhibits cell cycle procession [22] . Thus, SUMO modification is a conserved regulatory mechanism for this family of transcription factors.Some SUMO acceptor sites, such as those of HIC1 and C/EBPd, overlap with the cKXEP motif, where the lysine residue can also be acetylated [25, 26] . The SUMO site of MEF2D (myocyte enhancer factor 2D) lies within CKXEPXSP motif that can undergo much more complicated switching among acetylation, SUMOylation, and phosphorylation [27, 28] . It is worth mentioning that the amino acid sequences neighboring K33 of c-Maf (and K32 of MafA and MafB) match to the CKXEP motif ( Fig. 3C) . Whether K33 of c-Maf can also undergo acetylation/ SUMOylation switch is an interesting topic.SUMO modification does not alter the degradation or the subcellular localization of c-Maf. But how does SUMO modification attenuate the recruitment of c-Maf to the IL-4 gene? NRL, also a large Maf protein, can interact with TBP through the minimal transactivation domain) inside the AD region [29] . The K33 locates just right before the minimal transactivation domain (amino acid 47-110 residues) of c-Maf. Thus, the addition of SUMO may physically block the interaction between c-Maf and TBP. SUMO is known to interact with proteins bearing a SUMO interacting motif (SIM) [30] . SUMOylated-c-Maf may be sequestered from the IL-4 promoter by yet-to-be-determined SIM-containing proteins. The dominant SUMO site (K33) is located at the N-terminus, far away from the C-terminal DNA binding region. Thus it is unlikely that SUMO molecules directly block the binding of c-Maf to the half MARE site of the Il4-promoter. However, SUMOylation may result in intra-molecular conformational changes of c-Maf, leading to the seclusion of its DNA binding domain. These scenarios are nonmutually exclusive and remain to be clarified.Other transcription factors, besides c-Maf, can also induce IL-4 production by binding to its promoter. Some of these transcription factors have been reported to be SUMO-modified, but the impact of each of these SUMOylation events on IL-4 production is quite different. For example, JunB, an AP-1 family member, has been shown to be SUMOylated on lysine 237 residue in T cells. Blocking JunB SUMOylation diminishes JunBmediated IL-2 and IL-4 gene expression [31] . The CCAAT/ enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPb) has been reported to transactivate IL-4 gene expression in murine T cells and facilitates Th2 cell responses. SUMO-modification inhibits C/EBPb-mediated repression of c-myc expression but has little effect on IL-4 gene expression [32] . The Th2 master regulator GATA3 can also interact with Ubc9 and PIAS1. Overexpression of PIAS1 enhances GATA3 driven IL-13 expression but does not affect IL-4 production [33] . NFAT and YY1 have also been documented to be SUMO-modified, but the effect of SUMO modification on their IL-4 induction abilities has not yet addressed [34, 35] . As these transcription factors are often simultaneously induced during the differentiation of Th2 cells, these SUMOylation events have to be coordinated in a way to achieve the optimal production of IL-4. A recent publication reported that the binding of c-Maf to the IL-4 promoter was impaired in Th cells obtained from NOD mice [36] . They concluded that the impaired binding was due to enhanced SUMOylation of c-Maf at K33. As NOD Th cells display a defect in IL-4 production, it will be of great interest to examine the status of post-translational modifications, including SUMOylation, of the relevant transcription factors in NOD Th cells.In addition to transactivating the Il4 gene, c-Maf also plays important roles in both adaptive and innate immunity via IL-4-independent mechanisms. c-Maf is required for the optimal induction of CD25 in developing Th2 cells [37] . Recently, ICOS signal has been found to induce c-Maf expression on interleukin-17 (IL-17)-producing Th cells (Th17 cells) and follicular Th cells. Deficient c-Maf results in a decrease in the production of IL-21 and expansion of Th-17 and follicular Th cells [38] . c-Maf also regulates the expression of IL-10 and IL-12 receptor gene expressions in monocytes and macrophages [39, 40] . Furthermore, aberrant expression of c-Maf can be detected in myeloma and lymphoma cells, in which it controls the expression of cyclin D2 [41, 42] . Outside the immune system, c-Maf is indispensable for the transcription of crystallin genes and the development of lens [43] . Elucidating the impact of SUMOylation of c-Maf on the expression of c-Maf target genes within or outside the immune system will greatly advance our understanding of the role and mechanism of action of this important transcription factor.

However, the molecular mechanism of CD28 transmembrane signaling remains elusive. Here we show that the conformation and signaling of CD28 are regulated by two counteractive charged factors, acidic phospholipids and Ca2+ ions. NMR spectroscopy analyses showed that acidic phospholipids can sequester CD28 signaling motifs within the membrane, thereby limiting CD28 basal signaling. T cell receptor (TCR) activation induced an increase in the local Ca2+ concentration around CD28, and Ca2+ directly disrupted CD28-lipid interaction, leading to opening and signaling of CD28. We observed that the TCR, Ca2+, and CD28 together form a dual-positive-feedback circuit that substantially amplifies T cell signaling and thus increases antigen sensitivity. This work unravels a new regulatory mechanism for CD28 signaling and thus contributes to the understanding of the dependence of costimulation signaling on TCR signaling and the high sensitivity of T cells.", "citation_paragraph": "T cells are central players in immune responses to exogenous pathogens and endogenous cancers. T cell activation requires two signals: a major antigen-induced signal from the TCR, and a secondary signal from costimulatory receptors 1, 2 . The most studied costimulatory receptor is CD28, which has a crucial function in T cell activation. Without CD28 signaling, TCR signaling alone induces T cells to enter an anergic state in which they lose responsiveness to further antigen stimulation 3, 4 . Signaling from CD28 can increase T cell sensitivity, cytokine production, and cell survival. Moreover, CD28 signaling regulates T cell development, differentiation, and trafficking [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . CD28's important roles in the regulation of T cell activation have been exploited for therapeutic purposes. For example, CTLA4-Ig, a CTLA4-antibody fusion protein that acts as a high-affinity competitor of CD28 for ligand binding, has been used clinically to treat rheumatoid arthritis and to extend graft survival after kidney transplantation 12, 13 . The signaling domain of CD28 is also routinely incorporated into chimeric antigen receptor therapies to treat hematological cancers 14 . More recently, scientists have found that CD28 function is crucial in anti-PD-1 cancer immunotherapy 15, 16 .CD28 signaling relies on the protein's conserved 41-residue cytoplasmic domain, which has multiple signaling motifs but lacks catalytic activity 17 . YxxM and PYAP are dominant motifs localized at the N-and C-terminal regions 1, 3, 4, 18 . The YxxM motif recruits the p85 subunit of PI3K, GRB2 and GADS through phosphor-Tyr-dependent interaction with SH2 domains. The PYAP motif interacts with signaling proteins, such as Lck and GRB2, through phosphorylation-independent interaction with their SH3 domains. The phosphorylated PYAP motif can interact with the Lck SH2 domain and in turn recruit PKC-\u03b8 (ref. 19 ). These molecular interactions eventually lead to the activation of transcription factors NFAT1, NF-\u03baB, and AP-1 to regulate T cell activation and function. Besides the YxxM and PYAP motifs, the highly conserved polybasic region in the CD28 cytoplasmic domain is also required for Lck recruitment 20 .Several key aspects of CD28 signaling remain obscure. First, how is CD28 activity restrained in resting T cells? If the cytoplasmic domain of CD28 were aspects of freely exposed in the cytosol, it would be difficult to avoid phosphorylation-independent interactions with downstream signaling molecules. Second, why is CD28 signaling dependent on TCR signaling? Engagement of CD28 with its native ligands (CD80 and CD86), in the absence of ligands to the TCR, leads to transient transcription of only a few genes and does not result in T cell activation 21, 22 . However, in the presence of TCR ligands, CD28 can considerably augment TCR signaling to fully activate T cells. The molecular mechanism underlying this signaling hierarchy is not entirely understood. Third, how does CD28 signaling contribute to the high antigen sensitivity of T cells?In this study, we found that CD28 activity is regulated by negatively charged acidic phospholipids and positively charged Ca 2+ ions.", "citance": "T cell activation requires two signals: a major antigen-induced signal from the TCR, and a secondary signal from costimulatory receptors 1, 2 .", "claims": [{"text": "Major antigen-induced signals from the T cell receptor and secondary signals from costimulatory receptors are required for T cell activation.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Moreover, appropriate representation of both sexes as participants in clinical studies is still critically needed. Academic and governmental organizations must continue to articulate strong policy in order to ensure inclusion and analysis of sex as a critical variable.

Such observations have dire consequences on the utility of biomarkers, which may need to be used selectively based on the sex of the patient. The same is true of therapeutics, if the disease is manifested differently in females and is therefore improperly targeted with an inappropriate t reatment method.Sex should be a prominent consideration not only when defining the therapeutic target, but also the therapeutic mechanism; for example, drug efficacy is influenced by the number of factors including body weight, body composition, and metabolism.

However, the mechanism of macrophages promoting tumor progression is largely unknown.   METHODS The differentially secreted proteins of M1 and M2 macrophages were analyzed by mass spectrometry. We performed GST pull-down assay for the identification of cell-membrane receptors that interact with chitinase 3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1) protein. The mouse model was used to validate the function of CHI3L1 in cancer metastasis in vivo. Protein phosphorylation and gene expression were performed to study the signaling pathway activation of cancer cells after CHI3L1 treatment.   RESULTS M2 macrophage-secreted CHI3L1 promoted the metastasis of gastric and breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. The CHI3L1 protein functioned by interacting with interleukin-13 receptor \u03b12 chain (IL-13R\u03b12) molecules on the plasma membranes of cancer cells. Activation of IL-13R\u03b12 by CHI3L1 triggered the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, leading to the upregulated expression of matrix metalloproteinase genes, which promoted tumor metastasis. The results of this study indicated that the level of CHI3L1 protein in the sera of patients with gastric or breast cancer was significantly elevated compared with those of healthy donors.   CONCLUSIONS Our study revealed a novel aspect of macrophages with respect to cancer metastasis and showed that CHI3L1 could be a marker of metastatic gastric and breast cancer in patients.", "citation_paragraph": "Cell migration is an essential process for the development and maintenance of multicellular organisms and is defined as the orchestrated movement of cells in a particular direction to a specific location [1] . To migrate, a cell must modify its shape to be able to interact with the surrounding tissue structures. Therefore, the extracellular matrix (ECM) serves as a substrate as well as a barrier for an advancing cell body [2] . Cell migration is an integrated, multistep process that contributes to tissue repair and regeneration, orchestrates embryonic morphogenesis and drives disease progression. During cell migration, the moving cell first becomes polarized and elongated. A pseudopod is then formed, which attaches to the ECM substrate. Subsequently, regions of the leading edge contract, thereby generating a traction force that leads to the gradual forward gliding of the cell body and its trailing edge. Metastasis, which involves the migration of cancer cells from the primary tumor to a distant organ or tissue, is the most frequent cause of death for patients with cancer. Cancer cells utilize cell migration mechanisms that are similar to those exhibited by non-neoplastic cells during physiological processes [2] . The steps of metastasis include tumor cell adhesion to and invasion of basement membranes and the surrounding tissue, intravasation into blood vessels, survival in the bloodstream, extravasation, and growth at different organ sites [2] . Only a small proportion of tumor cells invade and disseminate. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying metastasis are still poorly understood because of their apparent complexity.Tumor progression is controlled by crosstalk between cancer cells and other cell types within the tumor microenvironment. The tumor microenvironment includes proliferating tumor cells, blood vessels, the tumor stroma, inflammatory cells, and a variety of associated tissue-type cells. This unique environment forms over the course of tumor progression due to the interactions of tumor cells with the host. This microenvironment is shaped and dominated by the tumor, which orchestrates molecular and cellular events occurring in the surrounding tissues. Although various immune effector cells are recruited to the tumor site, their anti-tumor functions are downregulated, largely in response to tumor-derived signals. Immune effector cells in the tumor microenvironment not only fail to perform anti-tumor functions but are co-opted to promote tumor growth [3] . Macrophages are a key component of the tumor microenvironment that act as facilitators of tumor cell migration and invasion, matrix degradation, and angiogenesis. The density of macrophages in the tumor microenvironment has been found to be a prognostic marker of poor outcome for a variety of carcinomas. Evidence from clinical and experimental studies has indicated that tumorassociated macrophages (TAMs) promote solid-tumor metastasis by releasing a variety of cytokines, including chemokines, inflammatory factors, and growth factors [4] [5] [6] . For example, macrophages can promote angiogenesis by secreting IL-1, VEGF, and MMP-2 [7] . Growth factors and proteases produced by macrophages can initiate tumorigenesis and enhance tumor progression [8] . However, many cytokines that are produced by cancer cells themselves also contribute to carcinogenesis [9] . Elevated cytokine expression may be a diagnostic cancer marker. Currently, TAM cytokine profiles are largely unknown. It is unclear whether there are some exclusively TAM-derived cytokines that are functionally essential to tumor progression.There are different types of macrophages, such as M1 and M2 macrophages [10] . Phagocytosis mediated by macrophages (M1 macrophages) is essential to the immune response of animals, as revealed in our previous studies [11] [12] [13] [14] . M2 macrophages can suppress inflammatory responses as well as promote angiogenesis and tissue remodeling and repair [10] . Our previous studies indicated that inhibition of microRNA-100 triggered apoptosis of breast and cancer cells by inhibiting ubiquitinationmediated p53 degradation [15, 16] , revealing a vital role of microRNAs in tumor progression. To further explore the role of macrophages in tumor progression, the proteins secreted by macrophages were characterized in this study. The results indicated that M2 macrophages are recruited by tumor cells. The M2-secreted chitinase 3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1) promoted the metastasis of gastric and breast cancer cells by triggering the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway.

Although various natural dietary compounds have anti-lipogenic effects, their effects on the acetylation status and lipid metabolism in the liver have not been thoroughly investigated.   MATERIALS/METHODS Following oleic-palmitic acid (OPA)-induced lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells, the acetylation status of histone and non-histone proteins, HAT activity, and mRNA expression of representative lipogenic genes, including PPAR\u03b3, SREBP-1c, ACLY, and FASN, were evaluated. Furthermore, correlations between lipid accumulation and HAT activity for 22 representative natural food extracts (NExs) were evaluated.   RESULTS Non-histone protein acetylation increased following OPA treatment and the acetylation of histones H3K9, H4K8, and H4K16 was accelerated, accompanied by an increase in HAT activity. OPA-induced increases in the mRNA expression of lipogenic genes were down-regulated by C-646, a p300/CBP-specific inhibitor. Finally, we detected a positive correlation between HAT activity and lipid accumulation (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.604) using 22 NExs.   CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that NExs have novel applications as nutraceutical agents with HAT inhibitor activity for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD.", "citation_paragraph": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) associated with excessive lipid accumulation in the liver is the most common cause of chronic liver diseases, including obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, insulin resistance, and diabetes [1] . At the molecular level, NAFLD involves epigenetic alterations in the liver [2] . Lysine (Lys) acetylation is a crucial post-translational modification for the epigenetic regulation of genes. At least 2000 proteins in human cells can be post-translationally modified at lysine residues via acetylation [3, 4] . Nearly 65 percent of these Lys-acetylated proteins are correlated with metabolism [5] [6] [7] . Thus, the dysfunction of Lys acetylation is major cause of metabolic syndrome, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dementia, cancer, and NAFLD [8, 9] .Two important families of enzymes, histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), coordinate the steady state of acetylation [10] . HATs add acetyl groups to the Lys \u03b5 -amino residues of histones besides other non-histone proteins; in contrast, HDACs remove acetyl groups [11, 12] . To respond to changes in metabolic demands and energy flux, metabolic enzymes (non-histone proteins) alters their catalytic activity or stability through the acetylation [13, 14] . With respect to the regulation of metabolic enzymes in the liver, the balance of histone acetylation/deacetylation by HATs and HDACs is important.NAFLD is conventionally explained by a \"two-hit\" model. Hepatic lipid accumulation is the first hit, causing insulin resistance, and excess inflammation by inflammatory cytokine interactions acts as the second hit [2] . However, recently, a new model in which multiple parallel hits are responsible for the development of NAFLD has been described [15] . The p300 HAT enzyme, which functions as a transcriptional coactivator, is involved in the first hit and second hit. It is co-recruited with nuclear factor-\u03baB to regulate various inflammatory signaling pathways [16] and increases the transcriptional activity of carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP), which is a coactivator of lipogenic genes via the acetylation of Lys-672 in the development of NAFLD [17] [18] . Additionally, these epigenetic factors are closely associated with the phenotype and determine progression of NAFLD [19] . In this study, we investigated the correlation between HAT activity and protein acetylation in NAFLD and identified natural extracts (NExs) that attenuate lipid accumulation by modulating HAT activity in an NAFLD model of HepG2 cells.", "citance": "At least 2000 proteins in human cells can be post-translationally modified at lysine residues via acetylation [3, 4] .", "claims": [{"text": "Many proteins in human cells can be post-translationally modified at lysine residues via acetylation.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 1503307, "title": "Communication between the AAA+ ring and microtubule-binding domain of dynein.", "abstract": "Dyneins are microtubule motors, the core of which consists of a ring of AAA+ domains. ATP-driven conformational changes of the AAA+ ring are used to drive the movement of a mechanical element (termed the linker domain) that provides the motor's powerstroke and to change the affinity of the motor for microtubules (strong binding during the power stroke and weak binding to allow stepping and recocking of the linker domain). Dynein's microtubule-binding domain (MTBD) is located at the end of a 10 nm long anti-parallel coiled coil (the stalk) and conformational changes that alter the affinity for microtubules must propagate through this coiled coil. A recent crystal structure of dynein's MTBD sheds new light on how this long-range communication along a coiled coil might occur.", "citation_paragraph": "Our current model for communication along the stalk is a sliding of the helices relative to each other (Fig. 4) by a half heptad. The proposal is that the line of hydrophobic residues in CC1 would slide in the grooves formed between the core residues in CC2. The movement would correspond to a transition between the weak binding +b registry observed in the crystal structure and the strong binding a registry trapped by SRS fusion experiments. While capable of explaining the experimental observations, there is as yet no direct proof that such a sliding occurs, nor any calculations showing that it is energetically feasible. It is perhaps useful therefore to discuss other possible mechanisms.A more extreme possibility than sliding is that the coiled coil undergoes a general melting (Gee and Vallee 1998) . Such a large conformational change is reminiscent of the coiled-coil transitions occurring during the pH-dependant conformational changes observed in influenza hemagglutinin (Skehel and Wiley 2000) . The best evidence against such a model comes from electron microscopy of dynein molecules in various nucleotide states (Sale et al. 1985; Burgess 1995; Burgess et al. 2003; Ueno et al. 2008; Roberts et al. 2009 ), which suggest there are no large changes in the structure of the stalk. Although the flexibility of the stalk has been observed to increase going from the apo (high affinity) to the ATP vanadate-bound (low-affinity) state (Burgess et al. 2003) , its overall dimensions remain fairly constant and consistent with that of a coiled coil (Burgess et al. 2003; Roberts et al. 2009 ). The other issue that must be addressed with a melting of the stalk is the entropic cost of unburying the hydrophobic residues in the stalk core.It is also worth considering whether larger movements between the stalk helices should be considered in analogy to the intermolecular sliding observed between dimers of the nuclear pore protein Nup58/45 (Melc\u00e1k et al. 2007 ). In that case, sliding movements of~11 \u00c5 were observed, corresponding to a whole heptad movement. However, the contacts between the a helices are entirely mediated by hydrophilic residues. The crystal structures suggested that contacts between these residues were made and broken as the helices slide past each other. These contacts appear very different from that in the dynein stalk, where the primary contribution is from hydrophobic residues. However, assum- Fig. 3 . Structural evidence for conformational changes occurring in the dynein stalk coiled coil. (a) Contacts of stalk coiled-coil helices (CC1 and CC2) with other elements in the MTBD. CC1 makes a small number of contacts with H4, whereas CC2 makes extensive contacts with the rest of the domain. (b) Pattern of hydrophobic residues in the core of the coiled coil. Left panel shows the model of the mouse cytoplasmic dynein stalk produced by extending the coiled coil from the known structure. Core residues are colored green (hydrophobic) and orange (hydrophilic). The right panel shows the separation of CC1 and CC2 with the two lines of residues in the core marked by arrows. In CC2, both sides are predominantly hydrophobic; in CC1, the left side is hydrophobic, whereas the right is hydrophilic. The fullcolour version of this Figure is available from http://bcb.nrc.ca.ing that the half-heptad model is correct, it is porbable that the hydrophilic residues in CC1 would have to make and break contacts as CC1 and CC2 slide past each other.Perhaps the most likely alternative to the half-heptad model is some more subtle rearrangement of the coiled coil, such as a small rotation of CC1 and CC2 with respect to each other. The best evidence for such a mechanism comes from the field of transmembrane receptors, many of which are thought to transmit signals by long-range conformational changes in the association of a helices across the plasma membrane (Matthews et al. 2006) . Hulko et al. (2006) determined the structure of a 4-helix coiled coil called the HAMP domain that sits directly under the membrane portion of many bacterial transmembrane receptors and transmits the transmembrane signal to the cytoplasmic enzymatic domain (e.g., histidine kinase). This HAMP structure showed an unusual (knobs-to-knobs) packing that led the authors to suggest that the mechanism of signaling is the transition from this packing to the more normal knobs-in-holes variety. Such a conformational change would result in a~288 rotation of each of the 4 helices with respect to each other. It is possible that a similar sort of rotation could occur along the length of the dynein stalk coiled coil, caused by relatively small shifts in the knobs-in-holes packing (Walshaw and Woolfson 2001) .One important question is whether such relatively small changes are consistent with the SRS-fusion and crosslinking data. In the case of the SRS experiments, a large number of different registries were tested and almost all of them gave a low affinity for microtubules (with the exception of the a registry). We interpreted this to mean that if the registry was not exactly that required to produce a high affinity (a) form, then there would be a break in the registry around the fusion site and the rest of the stalk and MTBD would default to the more stable +b registry observed in the crystal structure. Such a break in a coiled coil is actually observed in an artificially shortened form of Ndc80 whose structure was recently determined (Ciferri et al. 2008 ). This same explanation could clearly also be applied to smaller conformational changes, where the default conformation is favored in most constructs, whereas the high-affinity conformation is only favored in the fusions predicted to be in the a registry. In the case of the cross-linking studies , it may be possible to explain the effects in terms of small conformational changes, if one assumes that the cysteines can form disulphide bonds even when they are not directly across the coiled coil from one another. Formation of diagonal cysteine crosslinks could favor one conformation of the stalk, whereas a crosslink between directly opposing cysteines would favor an alternate conformation.In summary, in the absence of direct structural information, it is not possible to totally rule out one model of communication over another. However, one issue that is of interest is whether small conformational changes would provide a suitable mechanism for communication in dynein whose stalk, unlike the helices in transmembrane proteins, may have to bend in response to force. It may be that a half-heptad sliding mechanism provides enough of an energy barrier to prevent dynein spontaneously changing its affinity in response to force. On the other hand, given that dynein's affinity for microtubules depends on the direction in which force is being applied (Gennerich et al. 2007) , it may be that distortion of the stalk plays a direct role in controlling dynein's affinity for microtubules.In all of the models for communication discussed so far, the conformational changes have occurred as a concerted movement along the whole length of the stalk. However, it is also possible that they could propagate sequentially (Carter et al. 2008) . Such a wave of rearrangements (either small rotations or larger sliding movements) may lower the Removal of 4 residues marked in light blue produces a construct with a 10-fold higher affinity for microtubules. This suggests the left hand helix will slide so that its residues colored in yellow and green will pair up with the equivalently colored residues in the right hand helix. The large arrow shows the proposed direction of sliding of CC1 and small arrows, in the side view, show the potential movement of individiual residues. The full-colour version of this Figure is available from http://bcb.nrc.ca.overall energy barrier for the conformational change. An interesting analogy to this suggestion comes in the form of voltage sensitive ion channels, where the relative movement of the S4 helix is responsible for gating. Crystal structures of these channels show that part of S4 is in the more extended 3 10 helix form. This led the authors to speculate that this zone of 3 10 helix propagates along the S4 helix (Long et al. 2007 ).", "citance": "The best evidence for such a mechanism comes from the field of transmembrane receptors, many of which are thought to transmit signals by long-range conformational changes in the association of a helices across the plasma membrane (Matthews et al. 2006) .", "claims": [{"text": "Many transmembrane receptors transmit signals by long-range conformational changes in the association of alpha-helices across the plasma membrane.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small non-human primate which exhibits high reproductive efficiency, is a widely used animal model in biomedical research. Developing genome editing techniques in the common marmoset will further enhance its utility. Here, we report the successful establishment of a knock-in (KI) method for marmoset embryonic stem cells (ESCs), which is based on the CRISPR-Cas9 system. The use of CRISPR-Cas9, mediated by homologous recombination (HR), enhanced the KI efficiency in marmoset ESCs. Furthermore, we succeeded in performing KI in early-stage marmoset embryos. In the course of the experiments, we found that HR in the marmoset ESCs is innately highly efficient. This suggested that the marmoset possesses a repair mechanism for DNA double-strand breaks. The current study will facilitate the generation of genetically modified marmosets and gene function analysis in the marmoset.", "citation_paragraph": "In the current study, we established a gene targeting method for cjESCs and early-stage embryos, using CRISPR-Cas9 for directed DSB. This method dramatically increased the number of colonies that survived positive selection, and enabled bi-allelic homologous recombination. Furthermore, this method is robust, since KI of several genetic loci, including genes that are normally not expressed in undifferentiated cjESCs, was obtained with efficiencies similar or even higher than that of ACTB. Although the KI efficiency among total transfected cjESCs were low, experimentally shown to be between 1.8-8.3% with Cas9-gRNA (Supplementary Figs S3b and S11b), the percentage of KI clones among cjESC clones that survived positive selection was over 80% in most cases (Figs 2e, 3f and Supplementary Fig. S7h ), which is higher than that of previous studies recently reported using a similar strategy in human ESCs and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] and in macaque monkey ESCs (less than 50%) 34 . Additionally, in our method, we succeeded in obtaining over 10% of homozygous-KI clones in most cases (Figs 2e, 3f and Supplementary Fig. S7h ). This was surprising, as homozygous KIs has been considered to be difficult to obtain using the conventional KI system in human iPSCs 33 . We also observed an innate high HR activity of cjESCs, which may have also contributed to the extremely high KI efficiency revealed in this study. In the course of the current study, we observed a high KI ratio when targeting PLP1 exon 1, even in the absence of site-directed DSB with Cas9-gRNA. We were able to obtain KI clones with 88.6% (31/35 clones) efficiency without negative selection, one of which was a homozygous KI clone ( Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. S4 ). Since gene targeting efficiency of PLP1 exon 1 in mouse ESCs was 2% using a similar construct 13 , we consider our result in cjESCs to be extraordinary. Although this high efficiency was not observed at other loci without Cas9-gRNA, an HR bias may have occurred in cjESCs. Further studies to explore the mechanism of HR in cjESCs will be useful for improving the KI efficiency in other species.Since the PLP1 gene is crucial for the stability of myelin which are formed by OLs 35 , its mutation, deletion, or duplication leads to a functional impairment of the central nervous system 14 . Some PLP1 missense mutations cause severe phenotypes, yet null mutations or genetic deletions of the gene causes mild phenotypes 36 . Furthermore, the PLP1 gene is thought to be associated with schizophrenia in mice and human 37, 38 . Therefore, enabling genetic modification such as KO or introduction of missense mutation(s) in the PLP1 gene in non-human primates, as performed in the current study, would help to generate new disease models for analysing motor functions and higher brain functions, which could be used for testing drug candidates and cell implantation in a preclinical setting.FOXP2 was originally identified as the gene responsible for hereditary language disorder 19 . As such, the gene is likely associated with the language acquisition of human beings during evolution, since two amino acid residues (N303 and S325) are specific to human FOXP2. Humanized Foxp2 mice exhibit neuroanatomical changes of the striata and enhanced memory learning 39, 40 . Since some groups suggested the existence of homologues of the Broca's area in non-human primates, including marmosets [41] [42] [43] , FOXP2 would be an interesting candidate for gene modification in the marmoset.In addition, we also established KI technology in early-stage embryos of the common marmoset, which are based on both microinjection and electroporation methods. We succeeded in obtaining KI embryos with around 30% efficiency. In the future, this technology could be utilized for the generation of KI marmosets.In conclusion, we developed an efficient KI method for marmoset ESCs and early-stage embryos. The method may be used to generate KI animals and for analyzing gene functions in vitro using a non-human primate model. In addition, the HR bias, which occurs after DSB in cjESCs and was observed in several experiments presented herein, should be studied thoroughly for future development of the KI technology. The findings in the current study would facilitate the use of non-human primate species (marmosets) as bridging models to fill the gap between mouse and human.Scientific RepoRts | (2019) 9:1528 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-37990-w", "citance": "Since some groups suggested the existence of homologues of the Broca's area in non-human primates, including marmosets [41] [42] [43] , FOXP2 would be an interesting candidate for gene modification in the marmoset.", "claims": [{"text": "Marmosets have a brain region homologous to Broca's area.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 17455340, "title": "Artemisinin-based combination therapy does not measurably reduce human infectiousness to vectors in a setting of intense malaria transmission", "abstract": "BACKGROUND Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for treating malaria has activity against immature gametocytes. In theory, this property may complement the effect of terminating otherwise lengthy malaria infections and reducing the parasite reservoir in the human population that can infect vector mosquitoes. However, this has never been verified at a population level in a setting with intense transmission, where chronically infectious asymptomatic carriers are common and cured patients are rapidly and repeatedly re-infected.   METHODS From 2001 to 2004, malaria vector densities were monitored using light traps in three Tanzanian districts. Mosquitoes were dissected to determine parous and oocyst rates. Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite rates were determined by ELISA. Sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) monotherapy was used for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in the contiguous districts of Kilombero and Ulanga throughout this period. In Rufiji district, the standard drug was changed to artesunate co-administered with SP (AS + SP) in March 2003. The effects of this change in case management on malaria parasite infection in the vectors were analysed.   RESULTS Plasmodium falciparum entomological inoculation rates exceeded 300 infective bites per person per year at both sites over the whole period. The introduction of AS + SP in Rufiji was associated with increased oocyst prevalence (OR [95%CI] = 3.9 [2.9-5.3], p < 0.001), but had no consistent effect on sporozoite prevalence (OR [95%CI] = 0.9 [0.7-1.2], p = 0.5). The estimated infectiousness of the human population in Rufiji was very low prior to the change in drug policy. Emergence rates and parous rates of the vectors varied substantially throughout the study period, which affected estimates of infectiousness. The latter consequently cannot be explained by the change in drug policy.   CONCLUSIONS In high perennial transmission settings, only a small proportion of infections in humans are symptomatic or treated, so case management with ACT may have little impact on overall infectiousness of the human population. Variations in infection levels in vectors largely depend on the age distribution of the mosquito population. Benefits of ACT in suppressing transmission are more likely to be evident where transmission is already low or effective vector control is widely implemented.", "citation_paragraph": "Despite numerous clinical studies demonstrating high cure rates and gametocytocidal effect of artemisinin derivatives [9, 10, 40, 41] , there is no evidence that this translates into any measurable impact on malaria transmission intensity at the population level in these Tanzanian sites. Although, the potential to reduce malaria transmission is widely cited, some mathematical models predict only a modest incremental impact of the routine use of ACT over nongametocytocidal drugs in high transmission settings [19] . This observational study of the impact of routine delivery of ACT via health facilities provides some empirical support for this. Although, the parasitological study found a significant reduction in asexual parasitaemia prevalence following ACT introduction, this reduction was very modest (five percentage-points) and was not reflected in a measurable reduction of gametocytaemia prevalence in the human population [25] . In the present study, the most direct indicator of human-to-mosquito transmission, namely oocyst prevalence, was substantially higher after ACT introduction. It is unclear what caused this increase, particularly since the sporozoite prevalence did not increase at the same time (Table 2) the two periods. Because environmental conditions and availability of mosquitoes for analysis varied erratically throughout the study period, it is not possible to formally separate inter-annual and seasonal variation from effects of the policy change, but the overall conclusion is that any ACT-related reductions in human-to-mosquito or mosquito-to-human transmission in the mosquito population were small.Overall, these two large-scale, complementary studies of malaria parasite prevalence in both humans and mosquitoes did not detect any epidemiologically meaningful suppression of human population infectiousness following ACT introduction. However, mosquito population dynamics in Rufiji were clearly profoundly affected by variations in rainfall during the study period. Rainfall affects both the emergence rates of vectors, and probably (via effects on humidity) the survival of adult mosquitoes. This does not directly affect the infectiousness of the human population to mosquitoes, but has profound effects on malaria transmission as measured either by the EIR or the 95% CI = 95% confidence interval. SP = Sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine. AS + SP = Artesunate co-administered with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine.oocyst prevalence. The large variations in emergence rates and survival of mosquitoes very likely account for most of the variation in oocyst prevalence, though this cannot explain why infectiousness was so low during the first half of the study (prior to ACT) in Rufiji, or why the oocyst prevalence increased after ACT introduction, while sporozoite prevalence did not. Far fewer mosquitoes were examined for oocysts than sporozoites, and sampling variation thus contributes more to the oocyst data. The increase in oocyst prevalence thus seems very unlikely to be related to the change in drug policy. Nor is it likely that any substantive change in coverage of bed nets could have contributed to the observed difference in oocyst rates because net ownership and use remained relatively low and stable in Rufiji District until late 2005. There were no major changes in availability of nets in Kilombero-Ulanga during the study period [30] .Although an efficacious ACT with known gametocytocidal properties was deployed and achieved reasonable population level coverage with an estimated 0.6 to 2.2 AS + SP treatments per person per year, the majority of persons receiving treatment with ACT were symptomatic children. Thus, the asymptomatic, chronically infected, semi-immune older children and adults who likely constituted the bulk of the reservoir of gametocytes [23] were relatively untouched by the introduction of ACT for case management. There have even been suggestions of higher infectivity of gametocytes in asymptomatic carriers in comparison to symptomatic cases due to the large quantity of gametocytes in the former group [42] . In areas where the initial level of malaria transmission is relatively low, the ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic infections is higher, and larger proportionate reductions in transmission may be likely following introduction of ACT [6, 39, 43] . Conversely, in areas of high transmission such as investigated here, ACT may have little impact on prevalence, human population infectiousness and consequent mosquito-to-human transmission because a greater proportion of infections are only mildly symptomatic. Furthermore, even in settings such as these where artemisinins are combined with complementary partner drugs, such as SP which have long-lasting prophylactic effects [19] , ACT use may have little impact on overall transmission where it occurs at high intensities simply because individuals often become re-infected within weeks of treatment [1] .ACT might only have a substantial effect on the infectious reservoir if most of the infections are actually being treated with this drug class. The delivery of ACT through public sector outlets in Rufiji rose steadily from 2003 to 2005 with a total of 450,000 doses being deployed for distribution to all registered health facilities by that time [44] , corresponding to a mean consumption rate of 2.22 doses per person per year. Adherence among recipients has been estimated at 75% [45] , which implies that this drug was delivered reasonably effectively. The proportion of careseeking visits made to the health facilities that were feverrelated rose from 31.8% in 2001 to 54.7% in 2004 [46] , perhaps due to improved community perceptions, availability and affordability. Recent calls for accurately targeting ACT only to those with patent parasitaemia [47] may, paradoxically, further undercut the potential for case management alone to contribute to transmission reduction in highly endemic settings.While much emphasis has been placed upon the importance of the gametocytocidal properties of ACT, their most important contribution to lowering human population infectiousness is to terminate otherwise long-lasting infections with asexual stages, which intermittently but persistently generate gametocytes and can infect mosquitoes for over a year [19] . This is comparable to the effect of non-gametocytocidal blood schizonticides. Similarly, the impact of curative drugs upon onward transmission is probably primarily determined by the length of time successfully treated patients remain uninfected and consequently non-infectious, rather than whether that drug kills the relatively short-lived gametocytes already present at the time of administration. Therefore, while an effective cure may reduce human population infectiousness in an area with little transmission, in parts of Africa where it is common to become re-infected within weeks or even days, even regular treatment of symptomatic infections [48, 49] will likely have only a modest effect upon ", "citance": "Although, the potential to reduce malaria transmission is widely cited, some mathematical models predict only a modest incremental impact of the routine use of ACT over nongametocytocidal drugs in high transmission settings [19] .", "claims": [{"text": "Mathematical models predict that using Artemisinin-based combination therapy over nongametocytocidal drugs have a dramatic impact in reducing malaria transmission.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Mathematical models predict that using Artemisinin-based combination therapy over nongametocytocidal drugs have only a modest impact in reducing malaria transmission.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Mutations in the MeCP2 gene have been linked to Rett syndrome, a severe X-linked progressive neurodevelopmental disorder, and one of the most common causes of mental retardation in females. MeCP2 duplication and triplication have also been found to affect brain development, indicating that both loss of function and gain in MeCP2 dosage lead to similar neurological phenotypes. Here, we used the Xenopus laevis visual system as an in vivo model to examine the consequence of increased MeCP2 expression during the morphological maturation of individual central neurons in an otherwise intact brain. Single-cell overexpression of wild-type human MeCP2 was combined with time-lapse confocal microscopy imaging to study dynamic mechanisms by which MeCP2 influences tectal neuron dendritic arborization. Analysis of neurons co-expressing DsRed2 demonstrates that MeCP2 overexpression specifically interfered with dendritic elaboration, decreasing the rates of branch addition and elimination over a 48 hour observation period. Moreover, dynamic analysis of neurons co-expressing wt-hMeCP2 and PSD95-GFP revealed that even though neurons expressing wt-hMeCP2 possessed significantly fewer dendrites and simpler morphologies than control neurons at the same developmental stage, postsynaptic site density in wt-hMeCP2-expressing neurons was similar to controls and increased at a rate higher than controls. Together, our in vivo studies support an early, cell-autonomous role for MeCP2 during the morphological differentiation of neurons and indicate that perturbations in MeCP2 gene dosage result in deficits in dendritic arborization that can be compensated, at least in part, by synaptic connectivity changes.", "citation_paragraph": "In this study, we used the developing Xenopus retinotectal system as an in vivo model to examine cell autonomous effects of MeCP2 expression during the morphological maturation of individual central neurons in an otherwise intact brain.

These changes in dendritic arbor elaboration and postsynaptic differentiation occurred at the time when neurons begin to branch and differentiate, and were sustained throughout the imaging period. Therefore, cell-specific alterations in MeCP2 expression are sufficient to impact the connectivity and function of neurons in the developing, living brain.Mutations in the MeCP2 gene, loss of gene function, as well as increased MeCP2 gene copy number have been associated with neurodevelopmental defects that lead to Rett syndrome and mental retardation [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . Anatomical post-mortem data in humans reveal that alterations in MeCP2 expression lead to changes in synaptic number and in neuronal morphology in affected brains [8, 37] . Both transgenic and knockout mouse models have provided important information for understanding how MeCP2 miss-expression affects brain development and function [16, 17, 18, 19] . However, confounding or opposing results have been obtained amongst some studies that seem to depend on the particular mutation or analysis performed [11, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28] . For example, studies have reported a decrease in dendritic branch complexity upon MeCP2 downregulation in vivo and in culture [11, 23, 28, 38] while others show no effect of decreased MeCP2 expression on neuronal complexity [21, 25] . Interestingly, both downregulation and overexpression of MeCP2 in knockout and transgenic mice have Figure 5 . Overexpression of MeCP2 decreases new branch formation in developing tectal neurons but does not interfere with the stability of existing branches. The absolute (A) and relative (B) number of stabilized and newly added branches in MeCP2 overexpressing neurons compared to controls are shown by the bar graphs. hMeCP2-expressing neurons added significantly fewer new branches than controls during every 24 imaging period (0-24 h and 24-48 h, combined). As percentage, the number of dendritic branches stabilized over a 24 h period is significantly higher in hMeCP2-expressing neurons than controls (B), although hMeCP2-expressing neurons had fewer dendritic branches overall (A, absolute values; see also Fig. 3 ). Significance * p#0.05; ** p#0.005, ***p#0.001. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0033153.g005 been shown to impact dendritic morphology of hippocampal neurons in similar ways, suggesting that threshold levels of MeCP2 expression are required for the maintenance of dendritic arbor structure [28] . Here, by examining the early, dynamic effects of MeCP2 overexpression in single Xenopus central neurons in vivo we demonstrate that MeCP2 regulates different aspects of neuronal maturation and of synaptogenesis in a cell autonomous way. The observation that individual Xenopus tectal neurons overexpressing MeCP2 are morphologically less mature at the time of active dendritic elaboration than control neurons at the same developmental stage is consistent with observations that MeCP2 overexpression negatively influences the branching of mouse hippocampal neurons in culture [28] . Tectal neurons expressing wt-hMeCP2 had significantly less branches than controls and remained simple over the course of 48 hours of imaging. However, even though neurons overexpressing MeCP2 failed to increase dendritic branch complexity over time, the extended dendrites retained the ability to elongate. Thus, in the developing Xenopus visual system, altered level of MeCP2 expression and function impact the morphological maturation of tectal neurons by interfering with dendrite branching but not dendrite growth.Effects of altered MeCP2 expression on synapse density and function have been described for multiple neuronal populations in animal model systems [15, 39, 40] . Observations of altered synaptic connectivity in models of Rett syndrome correlate with observations of decreased dendritic spine number and loss of spines in the cortex in brains of subjects with RTT [8, 37, 41, 42] . In our study, we also examined the effects of MeCP2 overexpression on the ability of central neurons to form synaptic specializations on their dendrites. Our results demonstrate that even though dendritic arbors in individual neurons expressing hMeCP2 were less branched, the density of postsynaptic specializations, as visualized by the punctate accumulation of PSD-95-GFP, remained similar to those observed for control neurons in the intact brain. Importantly, time-lapse imaging revealed that neurons overexpressing MeCP2 increased the rate at which postsynaptic specializations continued to form. These results therefore indicate that gain of MeCP2 function interferes with dendrite initiation and branching, thus resulting in deficits in overall dendritic growth, but that these deficits in connectivity can be compensated, at least in part, by an increase in synapse number on the stunted dendrites.In agreement with our observation that synapse density is gradually increased in tectal neurons overexpressing MeCP2 are studies demonstrating that in hippocampal neurons of transgenic mice in which MeCP2 dosage is doubled, the density of glutamatergic synapses is increased even though dendritic branching and length are unchanged [21] . Thus, consistent with observations in mammals [21] , MeCP2 influences the synaptic maturation of neurons independent of its effects on dendritic arbor morphology and growth, allowing for compensatory mechanisms that adjust synaptic inputs to dendrite arbor geometry to maintain structural homeostasis [43] .In the Xenopus visual system, MeCP2 is expressed in both the retina and the optic tectum at the time of active retinotectal circuit formation and at the time when functional synaptic connections are formed. The observation that MeCP2 is expressed in the retinotectal system of this species is consistent with previous findings demonstrating high MeCP2 expression in early Xenopus embryos [6] and in the embryonic and adult zebrafish brain [7] . Hence, MeCP2 can play multiple roles during the formation and/ or maturation of neuronal circuits in the vertebrate nervous system. In Xenopus, MeCP2 can regulate neuronal precursor cell number by modulating transcription of the neuronal repressor xHairy in the differentiating neuroectoderm early during embryogenesis [6] . MeCP2 is also considered to be a regulator of global chromatin architecture in the cell, where it acts as both positive and negative transcriptional regulator of hundreds of target genes [44, 45, 46] . The genes putatively activated by MeCP2 code for proteins involved in neuronal development, synaptic transmission and neurotransmitter transport. Moreover, neuronal activity can further modulate MeCP2 binding affinity to the DNA [47] . One of the well established downstream targets of MeCP2 is the BDNF gene [28, 48, 49] . BDNF expression can be upregulated by overexpression of MeCP2 and down-regulated in MeCP2-null animals [44, 50] . BDNF knockout mice share many overlapping phenotypes with MeCP2 knockout mice, including smaller brain size, reduced dendritic arbor complexity and impaired synaptic plasticity. Moreover, BDNF overexpression in the MeCP2 mutant brain reverses some deficits observed in MeCP2 mutants [51, 52] , suggesting that MeCP2 affects neuronal functions in part through a BDNF dependent mechanism. Our previous studies show that BDNF plays crucial roles during Xenopus retinotectal circuit development, promoting synaptogenesis and retinal ganglion cell axon arbor branching and maintenance [31, 53, 54] . Here, we demonstrate that MeCP2 participates in morphological and synaptic development of tectal neurons in a cell autonomous way. While manipulations in BDNF levels or BDNF receptor signaling do not directly influence dendritic arborization of tectal neurons [30, 31] , it is possible that MeCP2 influences tectal neurons and retinotectal circuit development, at least in part, through a BDNF-mediated mechanism as tectal neurons express BDNF [55] . Consistent with this possibility, morpholino antisense oligonucleotide downregulation of MeCP2 expression resulted in altered BDNF expression in the Xenopus eye and midbrain, but did not influence the expression of the BDNF receptor TrkB (A.H.K. and S.C-C, unpublished).Our finding that MeCP2 impacts neuronal cytoarchitecture and connectivity in the amphibian brain indicates that MeCP2 function during neuronal development is conserved. How MeCP2 dysfunction impacts the morphological development of neurons, however, seems to depend on the type of neuron that is affected, the developmental stage at which MeCP2 expression and function are altered, and the particular brain region and species analyzed [15] . A large body of evidence also indicates that MeCP2 gene copy number, the type and penetrance of the identified mutations (partial or complete loss-of function), and whether MeCP2 acts cell-or non-cell-autonomously, are important determinants for MeCP2 function [56] . Observations that overexpression of wild type MeCP2 in cultured cortical neurons increases dendrite branching and dendritic processes length while expression of a mutant form of MeCP2 results in highly branched dendrites that are short in length [24] indicate that the gain and loss of MeCP2 function may produce similar phenotypes, and support the notion that the precise levels of MeCP2 are key determinants during the morphological development of neurons. Our observation that expression of a mutant form of human MeCP2 (MeCP2 R168X mutation lacking the transcription repression domain of the protein) above endogenous Xenopus MeCP2 levels did not influence tectal neuron dendritic morphology or growth (S. Marshak, data not shown) while overexpression of wild-type hMeCP2 significantly impacted dendritic morphology, is also consistent with the idea that the levels of functional MeCP2 protein within a neuron are important for proper development and function, and that nonfunctional mutations cannot substitute for endogenous MeCP2 during dendritogenesis. Increased MeCP2 expression can therefore have significant functional consequences for the morphological and functional development of Xenopus central neurons as in other vertebrate species. Indeed, increased MeCP2 copy number caused by duplication and triplication of part of the Xq28 chromosome carrying the MeCP2 gene causes a neurodevelopmental disorder in boys that is characterized by severe mental retardation. [4, 5] .That MeCP2 can exert both cell-autonomous and non-cellautonomous effects on neurons has recently been suggested by studies that analyzed mouse models of RTT with targeted mutations of MeCP2 [57, 58, 59] . Consistent with a cell-autonomous role for MeCP2 is also evidence that Mecp2-null neurons develop dendritic arborization defects when transplanted to a wildtype cortex [60] . Evidence demonstrating that mosaic expression of MeCP2 in brains of heterozygote female mutant mice results in wild-type neurons with dendrites that are less branched also supports non-cell autonomous effects of the MeCP2 mutation [61] . Moreover, evidence that astrocytes and microglia also express MeCP2 and that in the absence of MeCP2 expression glia can influence the morphological development of neurons point to a glial-mediated mechanism by which MeCP2 influences neuronal development [62] . Collectively, our in vivo imaging studies reveal a novel cell-autonomous effect of MeCP2, where increased expression of MeCP2 significantly impacts the morphological differentiation of affected central neurons and in turn influences their synaptic connectivity. It is also possible, however, that MeCP2 expression in the Xenopus central nervous system may affect neuronal development and function in both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous ways as is the case in the mammalian brain [61] . Potential non-cell autonomous roles for MeCP2, and the mechanisms and interactions between MeCP2 function and BDNF during retinotectal circuit formation are intriguing possibilities that remain open for investigation.In conclusion, by using an in vivo model system in which manipulations can be spatially and temporally controlled to examine the consequence of altered MeCP2 gene expression our studies demonstrate that MeCP2 exerts direct, cell-autonomous effects during the morphological and synaptic differentiation of Xenopus central neurons. These studies support the idea that MeCP2 gene dosage is important for proper neuronal differentiation and maintenance, as alterations in MeCP2 expression can lead to significant early defects in the growth and differentiation of individual neurons, thus impacting their connectivity in an otherwise intact brain.", "citance": "Thus, consistent with observations in mammals [21] , MeCP2 influences the synaptic maturation of neurons independent of its effects on dendritic arbor morphology and growth, allowing for compensatory mechanisms that adjust synaptic inputs to dendrite arbor geometry to maintain structural homeostasis [43] .In the Xenopus visual system, MeCP2 is expressed in both the retina and the optic tectum at the time of active retinotectal circuit formation and at the time when functional synaptic connections are formed.", "claims": [{"text": "MeCP2 influences the synaptic maturation of neurons.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

The therapeutic management of obesity includes lifestyle changes, medications, and surgery. However, the treatment of obesity is challenging because of diverse patient conditions, prolonged and chronic nature of disease, difficulty of maintaining dieting and physical exercise frequently [3] [4] [5] , limited effectiveness and side effects of the medication [6] , and high cost and risk of complications of surgery [7] . Other efforts are focused in the development of novel therapeutics, yet the effectiveness requires to be tested and confirmed [8] [9] [10] and the safety requires to be assessed [11] . Therefore, for the purpose of identifying new diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets and developing novel therapeutic strategies which not only produce sufficient weight loss but also lack side effects, further elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying obesity development is necessary and urgent.Recently, gene expression profiling analysis has yielded insights into the measurement of alterations in genetic expression patterns, and has facilitated the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) being crucial to obesity. In a study conducted by Roque DR, et al., obesity related genes, such as LPL, IRS-1, IGFBP4, and IGFBP7, etc., were found to be upregulated with increasing BMI among endometrial cancer patients [12] . The study of Gruchala-Niedoszytko, M, et al. also found a series of genes (PI3, LOC100008589, RPS6KA3, LOC441763, IFIT1, and LOC100133565) with a different expression that may be related to an increased BMI [13] . And genes of PGC1-\u03b1, FNCD5, and FGF, which play roles in adipose tissue development and function, were abundantly expressed in subcutaneous, visceral, and epigastric adipose tissues of extreme obesity patients based on gene expression profiling [14] . However, due to the gene expression profiling analysis merely focused on the effect of individual genes and transcripts, without regard to their correlated patterns of expression and the effect of networks of genes, it may fail to detect important biological pathways or gene-gene interactions related to obesity.Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) is a systems biology method for analyzing the correlation patterns of large and high-dimensional gene expression data sets [15] . It can be used to find modules of highly correlated genes, correlate module eigengenes (MEs) to external sample traits, calculate module membership (MM) and gene significance (GS), and find intramodular hub genes, etc. WGCNA has yielded novel insights into the molecular aspects to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. At present, it has been increasingly applied to analyze various gene expression profiles of hepatocellular carcinoma [16] , pneumocyte senescence induced by thoracic irradiation [17] , psoriasis [18] , severe asthma [19] , coronary artery disease [20] , and lung cancer [21] , etc. Although widely being employed, the WGCNA has, to our knowledge, not yet been applied to analyze the expression profiles of BMI-discordant monozygotic twin pairs.While monozygotic twins are characteristic of the genetic similarity and rearing-environment sharing, they show phenotypic discordance for certain complex traits and diseases. Thus, the discordant monozygotic model is becoming a popular and powerful tool for identifying non-genetic contributions to a phenotype variation including subtle difference in gene expression not mediated by cis-or trans-eQTL effects, and for linking environmental exposure to differential epigenetic regulation while controlling for individual genetic make-up [22] [23] [24] . Therefore, to reveal the potential molecular mechanisms of obesity, we performed both differential gene expression analysis and WGCNA to analyze the expression profiles of BMI-discordant monozygotic twin pairs.

We calculated the (1) time required for adjusted rehospitalization/mortality risks to decline 50% from maximum values after discharge, (2) time required for the adjusted readmission risk to approach plateau periods of minimal day-to-day change, and (3) extent to which adjusted risks are greater among recently hospitalized patients versus Medicare patients. We identified 1 392 289, 530 771, and 1 125 231 hospitalizations for heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, and pneumonia, respectively. The adjusted daily risk of rehospitalization varied by admitting condition (hazard rate ratio for women versus men, 1.10 for acute myocardial infarction; hazard rate ratio, 1.04 for heart failure; and hazard rate ratio, 0.98 for pneumonia). However, for all conditions, the adjusted daily risk of death was higher among men versus women (hazard rate ratio women versus with men, <1). For both sexes, there was a similar timing of peak daily risk, half daily risk, and reaching plateau. Conclusions\u2014 Although the association of sex with daily risk of rehospitalization varies across conditions, women are at highest risk after discharge for acute myocardial infarction. Future studies should focus on understanding the determinants of sex differences in rehospitalization risk among conditions.", "citation_paragraph": "This study demonstrates that there is considerable heterogeneity in the association of sex with rehospitalization risk in the full year after discharge across admitting conditions, with women demonstrating a modest but significantly higher risk for rehospitalization after AMI compared with similarly aged men. In contrast, men are consistently at higher risk of death across all studied conditions in the year after discharge. Results from this study suggest that vulnerability after hospitalization has complex relationships with sex and that this phenomenon seems to be condition specific.This study extends the literature in several important ways. First, this is the largest study with the most comprehensive ascertainment of outcomes to investigate sex differences in patterns of daily risk for rehospitalization. Second, findings extend knowledge beyond single disease states, predominately AMI, and simple event rates over discrete time periods (eg, 30-day readmission) by calculating dynamic risk trajectories after hospitalization for 3 common conditions. [1] [2] [3] 5 The focus on multiple conditions is a major strength because this provides insight into understanding sex differences in patterns that persist and do not persist-and is not about a single predictor or outcome-which could only be demonstrated by comparing across conditions. Results extend our previous findings showing that younger women (<65 years) are more susceptible than men to rehospitalization at 30 days after AMI despite adjustment for a range of extensive confounders. 1 This study builds on these results by demonstrating that this excess risk in older women, compared with men, extends to the full year after hospital discharge even after adjusting for age, race, income, and comorbidities, suggesting that other factors may be contributing to this risk. Third, we have also demonstrated important AMI indicates acute myocardial infarction; HF, heart failure; and HRR, hazard rate ratio. Sex Differences in Rehospitalization Risk differences by age. For example, women are at higher risk for rehospitalization compared with men at each age stratum for HF and AMI but have a lower risk for pneumonia. In contrast, for mortality, men seem to be at higher risk than women at each age stratum across all admitting conditions. These data are also supported by our previous work. For example, we have shown previously that regardless of age, women have a higher risk of rehospitalization compared with men over the first year after AMI. Although this increased risk persisted after adjustment for clinical factors, the poorer health and psychosocial state of women attenuated the difference. 6 Last, we also extend the literature by providing information on sex differences in patterns of rehospitalization risk on HF and pneumonia, which have been less extensively investigated than AMI.We observed significant heterogeneity in the adjusted sex differences in the risk of rehospitalization by condition, with Daily risks of first rehospitalization and death by sex after hospitalization for heart failure (HF), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), or pneumonia. Daily risk is described using hazard rates. We show daily risks for 1 y after hospitalization for HF, AMI, or pneumonia in (A), (B), and (C), respectively. Sex Differences in Rehospitalization Risk women having a higher rehospitalization risk than men after AMI in contrast with HF or pneumonia. Although the mechanism for this pattern of rehospitalization in women is unknown, there are a variety of biological and behavioral hypotheses which merit further discussion. For example, women are more susceptible to post-AMI complications (ie, bleeding events and longer lengths of stay) 22, 25 and have more unfavorable psychosocial risk profiles than men, which may hinder their recovery over the full year. Women also have a higher burden of stress, poorer health status and quality of life, 23,26 more depression, 5, 27 and fewer social supports post-AMI. 28 The lack of social support is one hypothesis because women in this study were older and may be widowed and more likely to be living alone. [29] [30] [31] The effect of sex on rehospitalization for patients with HF is less understood. However, this may be explained by women's increasing age and improved systolic function when compared with men. 32 In addition, women are known to have a poorer quality of life after HF, with more functional impairment, as well as more depression. 32 In contrast to AMI and HF, women may have a lower risk of rehospitalization for pneumonia because of a higher level of preexisting complications in men. For example, men are more likely to smoke than women and have a lower immune response. 33, 34 In addition, men have also been shown to have more chronic mucus hypersecretion, which may worsen prognosis and increase likelihood of death. 35, 36 Last, behavioral factors may also play a role because women may be more proactive than men about receiving further treatments after hospital discharge. 37 Further research is required to disentangle the determinants of rehospitalization risk, particularly how it varies across conditions. In contrast to the heterogeneity across conditions for rehospitalization, men are consistently at higher risk for mortality across studied conditions for the entire year after discharge. These findings merit further discussion on how they advance the field. For example, in terms of AMI, although women (particularly younger women) have been shown to be at increased risk for mortality after AMI in unadjusted analyses, 22, 25 much of this disparity has been attributed to differences in age and a clustering of attendant comorbidities (ie, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and previous coronary artery disease). 8 In fact, after adjustment for these differences, previous data suggest that women actually show an increased survival rate compared with men. 9, 38 Our findings support this concept, as although women had a significantly higher crude risk for mortality after AMI than men, this risk was reversed after adjustment for socioeconomic status and comorbidities in our present analysis. This suggests that the relative contribution of these factors may be accounting for the observed sex differences in the risk for mortality. About HF, the majority of studies suggest that women have better age-adjusted survival rates after HF than men, 39, 40 mainly because of a preserved ejection fraction, but have a poorer health status, and increased HF hospital stays. 32 Although the data on risk of mortality for pneumonia are mixed, 41, 42 men are generally more susceptible to mortality from pneumonia than women.", "citance": "32 Although the data on risk of mortality for pneumonia are mixed, 41, 42 men are generally more susceptible to mortality from pneumonia than women.", "claims": [{"text": "Men are more susceptible to death due to pneumonia when compared to women.", "subject": "pneumonia", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Women are more susceptible to death due to pneumonia when compared to men.", "subject": "pneumonia", "is_negation": true}]}

Recent studies identified germline NUDT15 variation as another critical determinant of thiopurine intolerance, but the underlying molecular mechanisms and the clinical implications of this pharmacogenetic association remain unknown. In 270 children enrolled in clinical trials for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Guatemala, Singapore and Japan, we identified four NUDT15 coding variants (p.Arg139Cys, p.Arg139His, p.Val18Ile and p.Val18_Val19insGlyVal) that resulted in 74.4\u2013100% loss of nucleotide diphosphatase activity. Loss-of-function NUDT15 diplotypes were consistently associated with thiopurine intolerance across the three cohorts (P = 0.021, 2.1 \u00d7 10\u22125 and 0.0054, respectively; meta-analysis P = 4.45 \u00d7 10\u22128, allelic effect size = \u221211.5). Mechanistically, NUDT15 inactivated thiopurine metabolites and decreased thiopurine cytotoxicity in vitro, and patients with defective NUDT15 alleles showed excessive levels of thiopurine active metabolites and toxicity. Taken together, these results indicate that a comprehensive pharmacogenetic model integrating NUDT15 variants may inform personalized thiopurine therapy.", "citation_paragraph": "A r t i c l e s effects: mercaptopurine can be directly anabolized by thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) to the inactive methylmercaptopurine, and thiopurine active metabolites can also be catabolized via dephosphorylation of thioguanine nucleotides (TGN) 32, 33 . Therefore, thiopurine cytotoxicity is determined by competition between the activation and inactivation pathways, the components of which are affected by genetic variations. In particular, SNPs in the TPMT gene have been shown to cause loss of TPMT enzymatic activity and excessive levels of TGN and to predispose patients to thiopurinerelated hematopoietic toxicity across multiple diseases 23, [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] . In fact, TPMT-guided preemptive thiopurine dose adjustment has been shown to substantially reduce the risk of adverse effects without compromising therapeutic efficacy [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] and is a prototype of precision medicine approaches to individualize drug therapy based on pharmacogenetics. However, substantial toxicity still occurs in some patients with normal TPMT activity, suggesting that additional variables, including other genetic variants, may contribute to the between-patient variability in thiopurine metabolism.Recent genome-wide association studies described a missense variant in the NUDT15 gene (rs116855232, referred to as c. 415C>T or p.Arg139Cys hereafter) that is strongly associated with thiopurine-related myelosuppression in patients with IBD 46 and in children with ALL 47 . Individuals homozygous for the risk allele encoding p.Arg139Cys were exquisitely sensitive to mercaptopurine and tolerated only 8% of the standard dose, and this NUDT15 variant alone explained 22% of variance in mercaptopurine tolerance 47 . Constituting a purported purine-specific nucleotide diphosphatase, NUDT15 is hypothesized to dephosphorylate the thiopurine active metabolites TGTP and TdGTP, thus preventing their incorporation into DNA and negatively affecting the desired cytotoxic effects of thiopurines. However, the exact mechanism by which NUDT15 regulates thiopurine metabolism has not been experimentally examined, and the functional consequences of NUDT15 variants are unknown.In this study, we systematically identified NUDT15 variants associated with thiopurine disposition and host toxicity, characterized the enzymatic properties of the corresponding proteins and comprehensively investigated the molecular pathways linking NUDT15 to thiopurine toxicity.

This pilot phase II trial aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of regorafenib when administered in first-line to frail patients with advanced CRC.   METHODS Frail patients without prior advanced colorectal cancer treatment were included in the study. Definition of frailty was defined per protocol based on dependency criteria, presence of chronic comorbid pathologies and/or geriatric features.   MAIN OBJECTIVE to assess progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 6 months. Treatment consisted of 28-day cycles of orally administered regorafenib 160 mg/day (3 weeks followed by 1 week rest).   RESULTS Forty-seven patients were included in the study. Median age was 81 years (range 63-89). Frailty criteria: dependency was observed in 26 patients (55%), comorbidities in 27 (57%) and geriatric features in 18 (38%). PFS rate at 6 months was 45% (95% confidence interval [CI] 30-60]. Median PFS was 5.6 months (95%CI 2.7-8.4). Median overall survival (OS) was 16 months (95%CI 7.8-24). Complete response, partial response and stable disease were observed in one, two and 21 patients respectively (objective response rate 6.4%; disease control rate 51%). Thirty-nine patients (83%) experienced grade 3-4 adverse events (AEs). The most common grade 3-4 AEs were hypertension (15 patients; 32%), asthenia (14; 30%), hypophosphatemia (6; 13%); diarrhea (4; 8%), hand-foot-skin reaction (4; 8%). There were two toxic deaths (4.2%) (grade 5 rectal bleeding and death not further specified). Dose reduction was required in 26 patients (55%) and dose-delays in 13 patients (28%).   CONCLUSIONS The study did not meet the pre-specified boundary of 55% PFS rate at 6 months. Toxicity observed (83% patients experienced grade 3 and 4 AEs) preclude its current use in clinical practice on this setting. Disease control rate and overall survival results are interesting and might warrant further investigation to identify those who benefit from this approach.   TRIAL REGISTRATION This trial was prospectively registered at EudraCT ( 2013-000236-94 ). Date of trial registration: April 9th, 2013.", "citation_paragraph": "CRC is the third most common cancer diagnosis after lung and breast cancer [1] . About 20% of patients with CRC have metastatic disease at diagnosis [2, 3] and up to 50% will have metastases at some point of the disease [2] . Median age at diagnosis of patients with CRC is 71. Therefore, a significant percentage of these patients are elderly and may be frail, due to either their age itself or comorbid conditions, leading to special vulnerability to treatment toxicity. Thus, the group of metastatic CRC patients who are frail comprises a mixture of elderlyfrail patients, frail-non-elderly patients and very old patients who may be frail without any specific debilitating illness [4] . A chronologic transitional sequence \"pre-frail to frail\" state with a strong biological background has been advocated [5] . However, there is little consensus on the definition of frail patients and the limits between the terms elderly-frail-unfit. A few factors such as ageing, dependence for performance of daily activities, associated comorbid conditions, and presence of geriatric features (dementia, delirium, frequent falls, incontinence) are the most important to be taken into account for the definition of frailty [6] .Treatment of frail and/or elderly patients with advanced cancer is controversial. Systemic antineoplastic treatment, although well intentioned, may be too toxic leading to deterioration of frail cancer patients. These patients are commonly either totally excluded from participation or underrepresented in large pivotal clinical trials. Thus, the level of scientific evidence is generally low in this clinical setting and a more speculative approach is unavoidable for making treatment decisions. Outcomes achieved with chemotherapy in these patients with CRC have previously been addressed. Indeed, a randomized clinical trial in elderly and/or frail patients with metastatic CRC showed that treatment with single agent fluoropyrimidines resulted in similar efficacy outcomes and better quality of life, as compared with combination oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy [7] . In turn, irinotecanbased combination chemotherapy did not show advantage in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) over fluoropyrimidines alone in elderly patients [8] . Therefore, the appropriateness of polychemotherapy to treat these patients is controversial, and better tolerated regimens such as single agent regimens or new targeted drugs may be more suitable for treating frail patients.Regorafenib (BAY 73-4506, Stivarga\u00ae Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc) is an oral multitargeted multikinase inhibitor with dual antiproliferative and antiangiogenic activity. A number of receptors such as VEFGFR1/3, KIT, TIE-2, PDGFR-\u03b2, FGFR-1, RET, RAF1 and B-RAF are the main targets for regorafenib [9, 10] , which is approved for the treatment of advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (after sequential failure to front-line imatinib and secondline sunitinib) and pretreated metastatic CRC (after exposure to fluoropyrimidines, anti-VEGF therapy and anti-EGFR therapy if RAS wild type). Results from the COR-RECT randomized study [11] showed that, as compared with placebo, regorafenib prolonged OS in patients with CRC previously treated with all approved standard therapies (6.4 versus 5.0 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.77; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.64-0.94; one-sided p 0.0052). Treatment was well tolerated being hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR), fatigue and hypertension the most frequent grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs).As the CORRECT study showed activity and manageable toxicity for regorafenib single agent, it was reasonable to investigate this strategy in first-line treatment of frail patients. Based on this background, this clinical trial was designed aiming to assess the efficacy and safety of regorafenib as a single agent in patients with metastatic CRC who were frail or unfit for chemotherapy.

Recently, it has been shown that DNA polymerase mu (polmu) and DNA polymerase lambda (pollambda) are both involved in such processing during non-homologous end joining in vitro. However, no phenotype was observed in animal models defective for either polmu and/or pollambda. Such observations could result from a functional redundancy shared by the X family of DNA polymerases. To avoid such redundancy and to clarify the role of polmu in the end joining process, we generated cells over-expressing the wild type as well as an inactive form of polmu (polmuD). We observed that cell sensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR) was increased when either polmu or polmuD was over-expressed. However, the genetic instability in response to IR increased only in cells expressing polmuD. Moreover, analysis of intrachromosomal repair of the I-SceI-induced DNA DSB, did not reveal any effect of either polmu or polmuD expression on the efficiency of ligation of both cohesive and partially complementary ends. Finally, the sequences of the repaired ends were specifically affected when polmu or polmuD was over-expressed, supporting the hypothesis that polmu could be involved in the repair of a DSB subset when resolution of junctions requires some gap filling.", "citation_paragraph": "The DNA polymerase m (polm) (1) belongs to the X family of DNA polymerases comprising the long time identified and extensively studied DNA polymerase b and the recently discovered DNA polymerase l (poll) (2, 3) .

The hallmark of animals or cells defective in one of the components of the NHEJ pathway is an increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR) (6) (7) (8) . However, cells isolated from animals knocked out for poll or polm do not present differences in sensitivity to any DNA damaging agents (9) (10) (11) . Furthermore, mice defective for both poll and polm fail to reveal increased sensitivity to IR (10) .

In addition to its well-characterized effects in peripheral tissues, emerging evidence suggests that neuronal Sirt1 activity plays a role in the central regulation of energy balance and glucose metabolism. In this study, we generated mice expressing an enzymatically inactive form (N-MUT) or wild-type (WT) SIRT1 (N-OX) in mature neurons. N-OX male and female mice had impaired glucose tolerance, and N-MUT female, but not male, mice had improved glucose tolerance compared with that of WT littermates. Furthermore, glucose tolerance was improved in all mice with caloric restriction (CR) but was greater in the N-OX mice, who had better glucose tolerance than their littermates. At the reproductive level, N-OX females had impaired estrous cycles, with increased cycle length and more time in estrus. LH and progesterone surges were absent on the evening of proestrus in the N-OX mice, suggesting a defect in spontaneous ovulation, which was confirmed by the ovarian histology revealing fewer corpora lutea. Despite this defect, the mice were still fertile when mated to WT mice on the day of proestrus, indicating that the mice could respond to normal pheromonal or environmental cues. When subjected to CR, the N-OX mice went into diestrus arrest earlier than their littermates. Together, these results suggested that the overexpression of SIRT1 rendered the mice more sensitive to the metabolic improvements and suppression of reproductive cycles by CR, which was independent of circadian rhythms.", "citation_paragraph": "adrenergic stimulation, and reduced inflammation [9] [10] [11] . The global knockout (KO) is difficult to interpret because most mice die in utero or perinatally [12] [13] [14] , and those that survive on an outbred background are runted [14] . Study findings showed the global inactivation of the acetylase activity by deletion of exon 4 led to a similar phenotype with embryonic lethality, but the few surviving animals had higher triglyceride levels, higher levels of fatty acid release from adipose tissue, and greater hepatic steatosis on a high-fat diet [15, 16] . Similarly, introduction of a point mutation (H355Y) that inactivates the enzyme activity caused runting, elevated oxygen consumption, and male infertility [17] , and increased the susceptibility to high-fat diet-induced metabolic dysfunction [18] .SIRT1 has also been reported to have tissue-specific effects. Forced reduction of Sirt1 in white adipose tissue by antisense oligonucleotides or conditional KO reduced body weight and white adipose tissue weight but increased macrophage infiltration, whereas overexpression prevents these effects [19] . Loss of SIRT1 in skeletal muscle reduces insulin sensitivity during CR [20] . Deletion in hepatocytes causes increased hepatic glucose production, fasting hyperglycemia, greater fasting-induced steatosis, and the development of late-onset obesity [16, [21] [22] [23] . A transgenic overexpressing line that uses the entire Sirt1 gene did not mimic intermittent fasting, despite enhancing brown adipose tissue function and protecting against high-fat diet-induced glucose intolerance [10, 11, [24] [25] [26] .Conflicting results have been obtained at the reproductive level. One study reported that the few surviving male mice from the global KO studies were infertile, as are the majority of female mice [14] , but another study found that mice could be fertile [27, 28] . SIRT1 is expressed in spermatogonia and has been implicated in germ cell development in males [29, 30] . In the ovary, SIRT1 is expressed in large follicles, particularly in the oocyte and granulosa cells. Loss of SIRT1 causes small ovaries with early-stage follicular development but no evidence of ovulation [14, 31] . SIRT1 modulates androgen receptor and estrogen receptor-a function that may underlie some of the reproductive effects [32] [33] [34] [35] . SIRT1 thus has beneficial effects in multiple tissues that ameliorate insulin resistance and support reproduction.SIRT1 also pays a role in the central nervous system, but the results are less clear. Many studies have focused on the role of SIRT1 to prevent neuronal injury in ischemic stroke, Alzheimer's disease, brain injury, and other models of neurodegeneration, potentially by reducing neuroinflammation [36] [37] [38] . SIRT1 also modulates cognitive function, synaptic plasticity, and learning [39] . Brain-specific deletion of Sirt1 using Nestin-cre decreases monoamine oxidase activity, increases serotonin levels, and decreases anxiety and depressive-like behavior [40, 41] . As in the periphery, SIRT1 expression and activity increase in the hypothalamus under fasting conditions, to regulate food intake and energy expenditure [42] [43] [44] . Some of these effects may be mediated by different neuronal populations, because deletion of Sirt1 in Pomc neurons decreases energy expenditure and increases susceptibility to diet-induced obesity in mice [45] , but deletion of Sirt1 in Agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons has the opposite effect and decreases food intake and body weight [46, 47] . Mice lacking Sirt1 in Sf1-expressing neurons have increased susceptibility to diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance similar to the Pomc neuron KO, primarily due to decreased energy expenditure and skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity, but the mice are fertile, and transgenic overexpression prevents these effects [48] .Thus, it appears that SIRT1 may play distinctive and sometimes even opposing roles in energy balance and reproduction through different neuronal populations. Interpretation of the studies is complicated by the different approaches used to delete the gene. Some studies use deletion of exon 4, which encodes the deacetylase domain, to create a mutant protein lacking enzyme activity, but other studies delete exons 2 and 3, resulting in the introduction of a premature termination codon so no protein is produced. The widespread expression of SIRT1 in the periphery and central nervous system makes it difficult to assign a function for SIRT1 in a particular process; therefore, we have chosen to create neuron-specific genetic modifications using transgenic cre recombinase that is expressed in a wide range of mature neurons. Using this approach, we recently reported that loss of SIRT1 enzymatic activity in neurons in male mice reduced fasting and glucosestimulated insulin levels while maintaining normoglycemia, suggesting increased insulin sensitivity [37] . In the current study, we characterized male and female mice expressing this enzymatically dead SIRT1 mutant, or conversely, conditionally overexpressing the wild-type (WT) SIRT1 protein, in mature neurons using synapsin-cre to distinguish peripheral from central effects on metabolism and reproduction.", "citance": "Mice lacking Sirt1 in Sf1-expressing neurons have increased susceptibility to diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance similar to the Pomc neuron KO, primarily due to decreased energy expenditure and skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity, but the mice are fertile, and transgenic overexpression prevents these effects [48] .Thus, it appears that SIRT1 may play distinctive and sometimes even opposing roles in energy balance and reproduction through different neuronal populations.", "claims": [{"text": "Mice lacking Sirt1 in Sf1-expressing neurons are immune to diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Mice lacking Sirt1 in Sf1-expressing neurons have increased susceptibility to diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Mechanisms that counterregulate exaggerated heart-specific autoimmunity are poorly understood.   METHODS AND RESULTS Experimental autoimmune myocarditis was induced in BALB/c mice by immunization with \u03b1-myosin heavy chain peptide and complete Freund's adjuvant. Together with interferon-\u03b3, heat-killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis, an essential component of complete Freund's adjuvant, converted CD11b(hi)CD11c(-) monocytes into tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1- and nitric oxide synthase 2-producing dendritic cells (TipDCs). Heat-killed M. tuberculosis stimulated production of nitric oxide synthase 2 via Toll-like receptor 2-mediated nuclear factor-\u03baB activation. TipDCs limited antigen-specific T-cell expansion through nitric oxide synthase 2-dependent nitric oxide production. Moreover, they promoted nitric oxide synthase 2 production in hematopoietic and stromal cells in a paracrine manner. Consequently, nitric oxide synthase 2 production by both radiosensitive hematopoietic and radioresistant stromal cells prevented exacerbation of autoimmune myocarditis in vivo.   CONCLUSIONS Innate Toll-like receptor 2 stimulation promotes formation of regulatory TipDCs, which confine autoreactive T-cell responses in experimental autoimmune myocarditis via nitric oxide.

Heart-specific autoimmunity is a consequence of the lack of T-cell tolerance to heart-specific \u03b1-myosin heavy chain (\u03b1-MyHC) in mice and in humans.Interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3)-producing Th1 cells represent a major subset of CD4 + T cells that infiltrate the myocardium in EAM; however, the role of Th1 cells and IFN-\u03b3 in pathogenesis of heart-specific autoimmunity is unclear. Mice lacking IFN-\u03b3 or its receptor are highly susceptible to EAM induced with \u03b1-MyHC/CFA. [10] [11] [12] In contrast, in a transgenic mouse model of spontaneous heart-specific autoimmunity, IFN-\u03b3 deficiency results in reduced myocarditis. 2 Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) 2 represents an inducible isoform of NOS that is absent in healthy myocardium but has been clearly associated with tissue damage in patients with ischemic and nonischemic heart failure. In animal models, NOS2-producing cells have been reported to infiltrate the myocardium of \u03b1-MyHC/CFA-immunized mice 10 and on infection with Coxsackievirus 13 or Trypanosoma cruzi. 14 In EAM, NOS2 production entirely depends on IFN-\u03b3. 10 NOS2-dependent nitric oxide has been shown to functionally eliminate heart-specific infections 15, 16 ; however, its definitive role in the regulation of infection-triggered heart-specific autoimmunity remains elusive.NOS2 is produced by various cell types, including macrophages, activated monocytes, stromal fibroblastic cells, and endothelial cells. Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1)-and NOS2-producing dendritic cells (TipDCs) represent another cell subset that is capable of producing nitric oxide. 17, 18 TipDCs originate from monocytes and therefore belong to a subset of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs). In contrast to conventional DCs, monocyte-derived DCs readily accumulate during infections and inflammation. 19 Both conventional and monocyte-derived DCs express CD11c and major histocompatibility complex class II and are effective antigen presenters, but they can be distinguished by CD64 antigen expression. 19 Monocytederived TipDCs have been reported to mediate the innate immune defense against bacterial infections. 17 Their role in the regulation of adaptive immune responses remains unclear.Here, we show how TLR2 activation together with IFN-\u03b3 signaling converts monocytes into TipDCs that limit T-cell expansion and EAM development through nitric oxide. The present study reveals a novel principle of how cooperation of innate and adaptive mechanisms confines autoreactive heartspecific T-cell responses.", "citance": "[10] [11] [12] In contrast, in a transgenic mouse model of spontaneous heart-specific autoimmunity, IFN-\u03b3 deficiency results in reduced myocarditis.", "claims": [{"text": "Mice that lack Interferon-\u03b3 or its receptor are highly susceptible to experimental autoimmune myocarditis.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Mice that lack Interferon-\u03b3 or its receptor exhibit high resistance to experimental autoimmune myocarditis.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Mice without IFN-\u03b3 or its receptor are highly susceptible to EAM induced with \u03b1-MyHC/CFA.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Mice without IFN-\u03b3 or its receptor are resistant to EAM induced with \u03b1-MyHC/CFA.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}

In this review, we discussed recent advances of DNA modifications on the regulative mechanisms of neural stem cells. Among these epigenetic modifications, DNA 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) modification is emerging as an important modulator on the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells. At the same time, Ten-eleven translocation (Tet) methylcytosine dioxygenases, the rate-limiting enzyme for the 5-hydroxymethylation reaction from 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, play a critical role in the tumorigenesis and the proliferation and differentiation of stem cells. The functions of 5hmC and TET proteins on neural stem cells and their roles in neurological diseases are discussed.", "citation_paragraph": "Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are a class of RNA molecules that have no ability to translate into proteins but function as regulatory factors at transcriptional or posttranscriptional levels, including ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), and others [37] . These ncRNAs have shown to play distinct but also conserved roles in regulation of differentiation of NSCs [38] [39] [40] . Among different ncRNAs, current evidences demonstrate that miRNAs play critical roles in the regulation of differentiation of NSCs. miRNAs are a group of small RNA molecules of 20-24 nucleotides widely found in eukaryotes. They bind to target mRNAs to regulate their gene expression by promoting the degradation of target mRNAs. Similarly, microRNA is also involved in the regulation of NSC differentiation and proliferation dynamic homeostasis; for example, high levels of miR-184, which are inhibited by methyl-CpG binding protein 1, promote stem cell proliferation but inhibit adult neural stem/progenitor cell (aNSCs) differentiation [41] . MiR-145 directly regulates Nurr1 (a nuclear receptor) expression level, and overexpression of miR-145 inhibits the differentiation effect of BMP2; knockdown of miR-145 promoted the upregulation of Nurr1, resulting in the differentiation of NSCs into dopaminergic neurons [42] . Micro-RNA can regulate many factors such as CT4, SOX2, and KLF4 in embryonic stem cells that are the direct targets of miR-145. The deletion of miR-145 increases the expression of OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4 and further inhibits the differentiation of NSC [43] . Recent studies showed that aging process begin when hypothalamic stem cells that coexpress Sox2 and Bmi1 are ablated accompanying with substantial loss of hypothalamic cells; the injection of exosomal miRNA in the cerebrospinal fluid, greatly prevented the cell aging process [44] .

Cancer stem cells (CSCs), a subset of cells within the tumor with the potential for self-renewal, differentiation and tumorigenicity, are thought to be the major cause of cancer therapy failure due to their considerable chemo- and radioresistance, resulting in tumor recurrence and eventually metastasis. CSCs are situated in a specialized microenvironment termed the niche, mainly composed of fibroblasts and endothelial, mesenchymal and immune cells, which also play pivotal roles in drug resistance. These neighboring cells promote the molecular signaling pathways required for CSC maintenance and survival and also trigger endogenous drug resistance in CSCs. In addition, tumor niche components such as the extracellular matrix also physically shelter CSCs from therapeutic agents. Interestingly, CSCs contribute directly to the niche in a bilateral feedback loop manner. Here, we review the recent advances in the study of CSCs, the niche and especially their collective contribution to resistance, since increasingly studies suggest that this interaction should be considered as a target for therapeutic strategies.", "citation_paragraph": "Epigenetic factors are also known to play an important role in drug resistance acquisition. One of these epigenetic factors are microRNAs. MicroRNAs are short (20-22 nucleotide), non-coding RNA, that regulate the expression of genes by binding the 3' untranslated region (UTR) and repressing the target mRNA translation [90] . MicroRNAs have been described to participate in cancer progression, malignance, drug resistance and even in CSCs properties acquisition [91, 92] . One exemplification is the microRNA-22, which increases the hematopoietic stem cells self-renewal though the inactivation of TET2 in myelodysplastic syndrome and leukemia, where was found upregulated [93] . Furthermore, the same microRNA was shown to induce EMT through TET-micro-RNA200 axis and to promote the metastasis in breast cancer mouse model [94] .As described previously, EMT activation promotes stem-like phenotype and consequent drug resistance [54] . Likewise, microRNAs involved in EMT activation have also been described to promote CSCs phenotype and drug resistance. The loss of microRNA-200 family increased the expression of EMT related genes, such as ZEB1, ZEB2, Snail and Slug in pancreatic CSCs both in vitro and in vivo [92] .Hypoxia also promotes changes in microRNA expression profiles, such as the inhibition of microRNA-34a expression, which in normal circumstances downregulates stem cell-regulatory genes and inhibits the CSC phenotype [91] . Under hypoxia, the up-regulation of Slug decreased microRNA-34a, which in turn increased the expression of the hypoxia-induced tumor carbonic anhydrase iso-enzyme 9 (CA9). The induction of this gene eventually promoted the survival of breast CSCs [95, 96] . Importantly the authors identified the active secretion of microRNA-34a within exosomes, membrane vesicles approximately 100 nm in diameter and essential for cell-to-cell communications [96, 97] , indicating a role of microRNA in the surrounding environment.Hypoxia also induced microRNA-21 in pancreatic cells leading to the acquisition of EMT phenotype and allowing them to escape apoptosis [98] .Other microRNAs also have been described to be related with drug-resistance, one example is the microRNA-27b. Loss of microRNA-27b was found to increase docetaxel resistance in Luminal A breast-type cancer by increasing the expression and membrane location of ABCG2. It also promoted CSC phenotype [99] .All these reports suggest that epigenetic factors such as microRNAs participates in multiple pathways promoting CSCs phenotypes and consequent drug resistance.", "citance": "One exemplification is the microRNA-22, which increases the hematopoietic stem cells self-renewal though the inactivation of TET2 in myelodysplastic syndrome and leukemia, where was found upregulated [93] .", "claims": [{"text": "MicroRNA-22 increases hematopoietic stem cells' self-renewal by inactivating TET2.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Previous studies have ex-pressed varied opinion on the protection from severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria by \u03b1+-thalassaemia. A random cross-sectional sampling of 456 children at the Komfo Anokye Teach-ing Hospital (KATH), Kumasi, Ghana were tested for malaria parasite, complete blood count (CBC), serum ferritin, and \u03b1-globin genotype. Alpha (+)-thalassaemic children recorded a sig-nificantly lower (28,705.0 \u00b5L-1) mean parasite density (MPD) compared to non-\u03b1-thalassaemic children (35,483.0 \u00b5L-1) (p<0.0001).

Alpha (+)-thalassaemia was hypothesized to protect against malaria via a reduction in the parasite density. The homozygous \u03b1+-thalassaemias were more protective than the heterozygous. Microcytic hypochromic anaemia was found in 141 (59%) of the subjects of which 71 were \u03b1+-thalassaemia. Alpha (+)-thalassaemia was shown to be a possibly key contributor to microcytic hypochromic anaemia amongst cases that were suspected of iron deficiency. Suspected iron deficiency cases should therefore be screened for \u03b1-thalassaemia to avoid the unnecessary administration of iron supple-ment.", "citation_paragraph": "The \u03b1+-thalassaemia is the most common single gene disorders in the world affecting 5 to 10% in the Mediterranean, 20 to 30% in West Africa, and approximately 68% in the South Pacific [1] . In Ghana, there have been reports of the high prevalence of \u03b1+-thalassaemia, especially the heterozygous affecting between 26-33% of the population [2, 3] . The \u03b1+ thalassaemia is prevalent in areas where malaria is endemic thus providing a compelling example of natural selection. Malaria reportedly accounts for 10% of Africa's disease burden and the fact that about 90% of the global morbidity and mortality of malaria is suffered by Africa especially children below five years [4] . Though \u03b1+-thalassaemia is reported to confer protection against the fatal consequences of malaria, especially the type caused by Plasmodium falciparum, there is however, a degree of controversy as to whether it is the heterozygous \u03b1+-thalassaemia trait, the homozygous \u03b1+-thalassaemia trait or both \u03b1-globin genotype that offer protection, or indeed whether the protection applies to all forms of malaria. According to a study in Papua New Guinea (PNG), the risk of severe malaria was reportedly reduced by 60% and 34% in ho-mozygous and heterozygous \u03b1+-thalassaemic children, respectively [5] . Some studies have however, expressed varied opinion on the protection from severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria by \u03b1+-thalassaemia. Whereas a Ghanaian study found no protection for the homozygous status [3] , a Kenyan study found protection for both homozygous and heterozygous conditions [6] . As is the case in sickle cell trait, the mechanism of the proposed protection might most likely be linked to a reduction in the parasite density [7, 8] .Similarly, \u03b1+-thalassaemia is suggested to have a causative effect on anaemia, specifically microcytic hypochromic anaemia; mean cell volume (MCV) < 80 fL; mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) < 27 pg).

Expression changes of other NCRs (PD-1, PD-L1/L2, CTLA-4) during inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS) were previously demonstrated, but VISTA expression in the CNS has not yet been explored. Here, we report that in the human and mouse CNS, VISTA is most abundantly expressed by microglia, and to lower levels by endothelial cells. Upon TLR stimulation, VISTA expression was reduced in primary neonatal mouse and adult rhesus macaque microglia in vitro. In mice, microglial VISTA expression was reduced after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection, during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), and in the accelerated aging Ercc1 \u0394/- mouse model. After LPS injection, decreased VISTA expression in mouse microglia was accompanied by decreased acetylation of lysine residue 27 in histone 3 in both its promoter and enhancer region. ATAC-sequencing indicated a potential regulation of VISTA expression by Pu.1 and Mafb, two transcription factors crucial for microglia function. Finally, our data suggested that VISTA expression was decreased in microglia in multiple sclerosis lesion tissue, whereas it was increased in Alzheimer's disease patients. This study is the first to demonstrate that in the CNS, VISTA is expressed by microglia, and that VISTA is differentially expressed in CNS pathologies.", "citation_paragraph": "Immune checkpoint regulators are a group of molecules expressed on T cells or antigen-presenting cells (APCs), which can provide costimulatory and co-inhibitory signals during T cell activation. This balance between positive and negative signals is essential for mounting antigen specific immune responses, while limiting the risk for autoimmunity. Inhibition of negative checkpoint regulator (NCR) activity has recently entered the clinic as a treatment for cancer, whereas activation of NCRs has potential for the treatment of autoimmunity. Therapeutic inhibition of NCR activity (immunotherapy) in cancer has been associated with the development of central nervous system (CNS) diseases such as encephalitis, myelitis, and exacerbation of multiple sclerosis (MS) (Cuzzubbo et al., 2017; Yshii, Hohlfeld, & Liblau, 2017) . Accordingly, several studies have reported that inhibition of NCRs (CTLA4, PD-1, and PD-L1) in mouse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS, leads to exacerbation of symptoms (Joller, Peters, Anderson, & Kuchroo, 2012) . Furthermore, blockade of PD-1 in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) improves cognitive performance , suggesting a broad role of NCRs in CNS pathologies. However, the effectiveness of PD-1 blockade in AD is still not resolved (Latta-Mahieu et al., 2018) .V-domain Ig-containing suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA) is a recently discovered NCR, which shares 24% sequence similarity with PD-L1 . VISTA (aliases: PD-1H (Flies, Wang, Xu, & Chen, 2011) ; DD1\u03b1 (Yoon et al., 2015) ; Dies1 (Aloia, Parisi, Fusco, Pastore, & Russo, 2010) ; Gi24 (Sakr et al., 2010) ) is expressed on myeloid and T cells, and can act as both receptor and ligand (Lines, Sempere, Broughton, Wang, & Noelle, 2014) . VISTA expressed on APC can function as a ligand, suppressing T-cell activation upon binding to a yet unidentified counter receptor . In addition, ligation of VISTA expressed on T cells also leads to inhibition of T cell activation (Flies et al., 2014) . Receptor functions on myeloid cells include regulation of the cytokine response (Bharaj et al., 2014) and uptake of apoptotic cells (Yoon et al., 2015) . Deficiency of VISTA in mice increases susceptibility to developing autoimmunity such as EAE and lupus nephritis (Ceeraz et al., 2016) .In the CNS, expression of several NCRs by microglia has been reported, which is induced under inflammatory conditions (Yshii et al., 2017) . Microglia are the principal innate immune cell type of the CNS, which acquire diverse functional phenotypes in response to environmental cues (Salter & Beggs, 2014) . During CNS pathologies, microglia lose their homeostatic signature and can shift to an immune-activated state, as evident from transcriptomic studies (Perry & Holmes, 2014; Zrzavy et al., 2017) . During immune activation, microglia upregulate inflammatory genes such as genes involved in cytokine production and antigen presentation. It is now appreciated that in conditions such as AD and aging, microglia can acquire a phagocytic phenotype (Galatro et al., 2017a; Krasemann et al., 2017; Varol et al., 2017) , thereby facilitating clearance of debris and toxins. In accordance with a more protective phenotype during disease, microglia obtain immunoregulatory characteristics during inflammation. Induction of NCRs (e.g., PD-L1) in immune-activated microglia causes inhibition of T cell activation, and suppression of cytokine production (Duncan & Miller, 2011; Magnus, 2005; Schachtele, Hu, Sheng, Mutnal, & Lokensgard, 2014) . Hence, microglial activation is highly heterogeneous and plastic, and can therefore be detrimental or beneficial during disease.Although the expression and regulation of several NCRs in the CNS and by microglia has been studied, expression patterns of VISTA are unknown as noted recently by Yshii et al. (2017) . Studies suggest involvement of VISTA in important functions of monocytes and macrophages, such as cytokine responses and phagocytosis, which exhibit functional similarities to microglia. As microglia express many NCRs and are able to acquire immunoregulatory functions during inflammation, analysis of VISTA expression in these cells could help to understand their role in CNS disease. Furthermore, NCR modulation as a treatment for cancer and autoimmunity impacts CNS biology, which is demonstrated by adverse neurological effects during immunotherapy including encephalitis, myelitis, hypophysitis, and transition from radiologically isolated syndrome to MS (Cuzzubbo et al., 2017; Yshii et al., 2017) . Hence, investigating expression and expression changes of VISTA in the CNS might facilitate understanding the impact of NCR modulation on the CNS.Here, we assessed VISTA expression in mouse and rhesus macaque microglia after immune-activation in vitro and in vivo, and verified our findings using human postmortem tissue. Our results indicate that VISTA is differentially expressed in microglia during inflammation and neurodegeneration. Furthermore, we determined epigenetic changes in the VISTA gene during microglial activation in mice. These findings provide first evidence of a function of VISTA in microglia and during CNS pathology.", "citance": "Microglia are the principal innate immune cell type of the CNS, which acquire diverse functional phenotypes in response to environmental cues (Salter & Beggs, 2014) .", "claims": [{"text": "Microglia are an innate immune cell type of the central nervous system.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Microglia are an innate immune cell type of the peripheral nervous system.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}

Migraine, especially with aura (MA), is a known risk factor for ischemic stroke. The association between CAD and migraine was suggested based on a few small studies, but there are no large-scale case-control data, and the mechanisms are not yet clear. Methods: We compared the lifetime prevalence of migraine and migraine characteristics in 313 CAD patients with 313 healthy age- and sex-matched controls. We also analyzed clinical and radiological characteristics of CAD with respect to migraine subtypes to investigate whether clear phenotypical associations can be found that might help in the search for a possible shared genetic background for migraine and CAD. Results: Migraine was clearly more common in CAD patients than in controls (36 vs. 23%; OR 2.15; 95% CI 1.48\u20133.14), and the association was also highly significant for MA (23 vs. 12%; OR 2.41; 95% CI 1.53\u20133.80). Percentages of reported migraine history and MA of CAD patients vs. controls compared separately for both sexes were as follows: for women, migraine 54 vs. 35% (OR 2.30; 95% CI 1.28\u20134.13), MA 35 vs. 18% (OR 2.79; 95% CI 1.40\u20135.59); for men, migraine 27 vs. 16% (OR 2.02; 95% CI 1.23\u20133.31), MA 16 vs. 10% (OR 2.21; 95% CI 1.19\u20134.11). Over 60% of the CAD patients with still active migraine at the time of dissection reported later alleviation of migraine activity. Conclusion: Our observations suggest that patients with CAD are a significant link between ischemic stroke and migraine. This connection may represent a common pathophysiological or genetic background, or both. Migraine activity appears to be alleviated by CAD.", "citation_paragraph": "Our results confirm in the large series of 313 cases and 313 control subjects the association between migraine and CAD that was previously reported in small series [4] [5] [6] [7] . Furthermore, this is the first study to show that an association exists also between MA and CAD. We have previously shown that CAD is the most common single etiology of stroke in young adults [2] . Our results further indicate that patients with CAD are a significant link between ischemic stroke and migraine, as the lifetime prev- alence of migraine in subjects with CAD was as high as 36%. Migraine pathophysiology involves dysfunction in both neuronal and vascular systems, but in recent years, the research focus has generally been on the neuronal system. Our results associating migraine to an arterial disorder suggest that vascular system phenomena should not be overlooked. Although systematic evaluation of genetic risk factors of CAD is yet ongoing [11] , there is reasonable evidence indicating that both migraine and CAD are multifactorial diseases with genetic predisposition [12] . We previously hypothesized that CAD patients may have a constitutional, genetically determined weakness of the vessel wall, and that environmental factors, such as acute infection or minor trauma, could act as triggers [11] . It remains to be elucidated whether a mutual arterial pathophysiology shared by CAD and migraine, or simply concomitant inherited susceptibility, exists. However, the alleviation of migraine activity after CAD observed in our study supports the hypothesis of some causal relationship between these diseases.A recent meta-analysis found that only MA, but not MO, is associated with ischemic stroke [1] . The association between ischemic stroke and migraine is probably multifactorial. A shared genetic background linking CAD, migraine and ischemic stroke has been studied. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) polymorphism has been associated with MA [13] , but conflicting results have also been reported [14, 15] . A recent study linked both migraine and C667T MTHFR genotype with CAD [16] . Another large study reported that the same C667T MTHFR genotype in women with active MA increased the risk for ischemic stroke more than fourfold [17] . Serum elastase activity is known to be involved in matrix degradation, and migraine patients have been shown to have higher serum elastase activity than controls [18] . In agreement with increased risk for CAD in patients with MA, the relationship was even stronger for MA than for MO. The comorbidity of CAD and migraine could also be mediated by impaired systemic endothelium-dependent vasodilation that has been demonstrated in CAD patients [19] , possibly exposing arterial walls to damage and subsequent dissection.We studied the characteristics of migraine with a validated questionnaire [10] . Subjects with CAD reported more vomiting during migraine attacks than controls. It remains to be studied if the repeated vomiting due to migraine that causes stretching of subject's neck could predispose to CAD by mechanical damage to the cervical arteries. A strong causal relationship is, however, unlikely considering how rarely CAD patients generally report extensive vomiting as the likely triggering factor for CAD. Although the difference was not statistically significant and further studies are required, migraine appeared to be more intensive in CAD patients than in controls, especially measured by the number of severe and moderate attacks in a lifetime (149 vs. 88 attacks). Neither were there differences in the characteristics of the dissections between migraineurs and nonmigraineurs. In some earlier studies, multiple artery dissections were more common (14-30%) than in the present one (8%) and unlike here, multiple artery dissection patients had more migraine than other CAD patients. However, these studies were small and the association was not always statistically significant [5, 6] .Dissection seemed to diminish later migraine activity. Of those 45 patients whose migraine was still active at the time of dissection, more than 64% reported alleviation to some degree (29/45), and 29% (13/45) reported complete cessation of migraine symptoms. In a previous study, migrainous infarction was reported to have a similar effect [20] . It seemed that alleviation of migraine was linked to CAD irrespective of possible ischemic stroke or location of CAD. Migraine commonly eases during menopause, but this is an unlikely explanation in our series, as almost half (46%) of those subjects who reported complete or marked alleviation of migraine were men. In addition, the subjects in whom migraine was alleviated were younger (42.1 years) than CAD patients in general (46.1 years). The role of CAD and ischemic stroke treatments, such as the use of anticoagulants and antihypertensive medications, remains unclear [21] .One-year prevalence of migraine has generally been estimated to be 10-12% [22] , but reported numbers have been higher concerning lifetime prevalence (up to 33% in women) [23, 24] . In our control population, lifetime prevalence of migraine was quite high, up to 23%. No population-based studies of migraine prevalence in Finland exist, but it is likely comparable to that in other Northern European countries [25] .In summary, we show for the first time that migraine and especially MA are associated with CAD, as well as vomiting and prodromal neck sensations are related to migraine in CAD patients. Importantly, the latter association is not explained by the onset of CAD, as the prodromal neck sensations reflect patients' long-term migraine characteristics. Our study also indicates that migraineurs who suffer CAD tend to have more intensive migraine attacks than other migraineurs. These associations may represent a common pathophysiological or ge-netic background and should be taken into account when designing studies [11, 12] on stroke and migraine. In addition, our results support the view that CAD or ischemic stroke, or both, might cause migraine alleviation. On the other hand, we found no association between migraine and the location of the CAD, and there was no difference in the incidence of CAD-related brain infarction between migraineurs and nonmigraineurs.", "citance": "A recent meta-analysis found that only MA, but not MO, is associated with ischemic stroke [1] .", "claims": [{"text": "Migraine with aura is associated with ischemic stroke.

{"s2orc_id": 25625583, "title": "Investigating the barriers to effective management of musculoskeletal pain: an international survey", "abstract": "An international study was performed to investigate the discrepancy between physician and population perception of the management of musculoskeletal pain (MP). One thousand, one hundred and fifty-four people with MP and 604 primary care physicians randomly selected from six countries (UK, Germany, Italy, France, Australia and Mexico) were interviewed by telephone. The interviews were based on structured questionnaires that captured: the management of pain, knowledge about the condition, sources of information, information communicated within the consultation, and patient roles in pain management. People with MP are confused about the different treatment options available (up to 63% out of N = 1,154) to them and their relative benefits and risks (33\u201351%). Doctors are the most valued and appropriate source of information (by up to 80% of people, N = 1,154) but are difficult to access. When people do have a clinical consultation, there may be a disparity between the information doctors convey and patient recall of the information provided. For example, most doctors tell patients the number of tablets they will need to take to achieve optimal pain relief, but only 34\u201363% of people with MP recall being given this information. Lack of information may partially explain why so few people (7\u201336%) return to their doctor when their prescribed medication is ineffective. This survey identified lack of information as a potential barrier to effective treatment. Physicians\u2019 perceptions that people with MP are not able to appraise all the information and may prefer a passive role in their care need to be challenged if patients are to be participants in the management of their condition.", "citation_paragraph": "The results from this study confirm that MP continues to have a significant impact on the functioning and quality of life on people in different countries from different cultural backgrounds. As with a previous large-scale European survey [6] , this study found a disparity between perspectives of people with MP and primary care physicians in relation to the management of pain. This disparity encompassed not only the management of pain but the relationship between doctors and patients and the information exchanged within clinical consultations. In particular, this study highlighted barriers to patient involvement in decisions about the management of their condition.In addition, this survey highlighted people's reluctance to return to their physician for further advice or treatment when their prescribed medication was ineffective. In this situation, most people resort to non-pharmacological strategies with fewer than 40% choosing to return to their doctor. The reasons for this reluctance were not explicitly sought in this study, but previous research has identified physician beliefs about the futility of treating osteoarthritis and a normalisation of chronic MP that may reinforce patient beliefs [6] [7] [8] .Another explanation may be that people with MP are not aware of the ways in which doctors might offer alternative help. Data from this survey suggest that even though people with MP use a wide variety of sources of information about their condition, they may not be fully informed. For example, very few people in this survey were aware of the recent high-profile controversies surrounding the use of NSAIDs. What is preventing them from being informed? Most people get at least some of their information from their primary care physician and cite doctors as the most important and appropriate source of information but also report that it is difficult to access this information through doctors because of the requirement to make an appointment. Doctors feel that the time constraints of the consultation make it difficult to provide information about the benefits and risks of all the different treatment options and many also think that patients do not have the knowledge or skills necessary to appraise all this information. As a result, doctors may be limiting the information they give patients so that even when patients do get access, they may not get the information they need to make informed choices about the management of their condition.Physicians in this survey report that they cover all important aspects of treatment and care in their consultations with patients, but this was not the experience of people with MP. Fewer than half of them had discussed any of the important aspects of their treatment at their most recent consultation. This may be a problem of recall, but other studies have found that patients recall 17-60% of the detailed information they receive from doctors immediately post-consultation [9] . More recent research suggests that patients remember information that has meaning or importance for them but that their interpretation of the information may differ from that of the doctor [10, 11, 12] . Doctors may be providing detailed information but may not be communicating it in a way that makes sense or is relevant for the person with MP. People with MP were not matched to their physician in this study so there is a possibility that they were reporting different experiences rather than a mismatch of information exchange and understanding within consultations. However, they were both random samples, and the findings reflect those of previous studies where samples were matched. Misunderstandings between doctors and patients that arise from communication problems in the consultation are common (one study identified fourteen categories of misunderstanding between doctor and patient [13] ) and can have adverse outcomes such as non-adherence.One important aspect of providing patients with the information they need to make informed treatment choices is communicating the relative risks and benefits of treatment options. Many physicians in this survey found it easy to convey the risks and benefits of treatment to patients, but people with MP found the information confusing, and few recalled having discussed the risks and benefits of their treatment with their doctor. Communicating and interpreting information about risk and benefit is complex. Several studies have highlighted both the difficulties in conveying accurate information about relative risks and benefits and the impact on perceptions of risk on adherence to medication [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] .Data from this study are limited in their ability to provide full explanations for the complex constructs of health behaviour and doctor-patient interaction. This was a cross-sectional study in which the responses of physicians were not matched with those of their patients with MP, which would have facilitated a more direct comparison between physician and population reports. The study relied on self-report and recall, both of which are vulnerable to bias, and whilst the overall sample size was large, the sample sizes in each country were modest, and some of the sub-groups generated by the analysis were very small. Nevertheless, they were random samples of physicians and the population, and the data do provide interesting insights that might inform clinical practice.Data from this study have important implications for the management of MP. People with MP are generally poorly informed or have a poor understanding of their condition and the treatment options available to them. Patient organisations, government organisations and professional organisations in many countries are promoting the concepts of patient involvement and partnership, user-led services and concordant relationships [19, 20] . None of these will be achievable for people with MP unless they are fully informed about their condition and treatment. This study has highlighted several barriers to patient involvement, and there are solutions that might overcome some of these barriers.Misunderstandings between doctors and patients could be reduced by ensuring the exchange of relevant information. This could be facilitated within the constraints of the consultation by using aids such as patient lists that tell patients what information the doctor will need to know and what questions to ask about their condition and treatment or prompts for doctors that help them to communicate benefit and risk more effectively. These may include some very simple but important messages such as how many tablets to take to achieve adequate pain control. In four out of the six countries in this study, fewer than half the people with MP recalled ever being given this information. Patient diaries could be used to capture patterns of pain and medication use to help patients and doctors evaluate the effectiveness of medication and perhaps find ways of taking it more effectively. In this study, the effectiveness of current treatment was evaluated in fewer than 53% of recent consultations with a doctor or specialist nurse. Further work is needed to identify more effective ways of communicating the relative risks and benefits of different treatment options. There is unlikely to be a single solution to the issues raised in this study, but a series of small interventions may help people become active participants in the management of their condition.", "citance": "Misunderstandings between doctors and patients that arise from communication problems in the consultation are common (one study identified fourteen categories of misunderstanding between doctor and patient [13] ) and can have adverse outcomes such as non-adherence.", "claims": [{"text": "Misunderstandings between doctors and patients can lead to non-adherence.", "subject": "Misunderstandings between doctors and patients", "is_negation": false}]}

We describe the basic role of epigenetics in the human brain and how it may affect neuropathology, as well as the epigenetic mechanisms involved in the development of various stem cells, including mesenchymal stem cells, neural stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, and hematopoietic stem cells. In addition, the therapeutic roles of stem cells for treating neurodegenerative diseases, such as Huntington\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, Rett Syndrome, spinocerebellar ataxia, and multiple sclerosis are explored. The goal of the chapter is to help increase our understanding of epigenetics of stem cell biology, given that this is fundamentally important for designing stem-cell-based therapies with regards to maximizing efficiency and long-term efficacy, while reducing adverse effects which comprise the most critical criteria for translating the stem cell therapy from the bench to the bedside.", "citation_paragraph": "Generation of neurons and glial cells from progenitor cells involve epigenetic mechanisms that take place throughout the developmental stages of the brain.The outer layer of the embryo, called ectoderm, forms the central nervous system, and during the process of development, DNA methylation controls the epigenetic mechanisms of the embryonic cells. For example, to prevent the differentiation of nonneuronal cells into mature neurons, the proneural genes, as well as gene which are associated with proteins involved with neurogenesis, such as the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene, are silenced by DNA methylation at their promoter region. However, DNA remethylation can take place on a neuronal gene, such as Sox2 [11] , which allows for the selective initiation of neuronal development. Similarly, during initial development of the cortex, the genes involved in the formation of glial cells are suppressed by DNA methylation, promoting the formation of more neurons during the early stages of neuronal development. Eventually, during the later stages of cortical development, the DNA methylation is reversed, leading to the generation of glial cells [12, 13] . Some of the genes involved in postnatal neurogenesis are Sox2, Dlx2, Sp8, and Neurog2 and those involved in the formation of glial cells are Sparcl1 and Nkx2-2. It has been shown that during the differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) or progenitor cells, DNA methylation is facilitated by DNMT3a, which silences the genes Sparcl1 and Nkx2-2, leading to the inhibition of glial cell formation and promotion of mature neuron development from NSCs [14] . It is also believed that the normal aging process in humans is associated with modification of the epigenome in the brain, affecting certain genes related to neurogenesis, especially within the cortex [15] . This process leads to the disruption of synapses, abnormal neurotransmission, and is associated to age-related disorders [16] . However, a comprehensive description of the epigenetic mechanisms related to aging is beyond the scope of this chapter.", "citance": "It is also believed that the normal aging process in humans is associated with modification of the epigenome in the brain, affecting certain genes related to neurogenesis, especially within the cortex [15] .", "claims": [{"text": "Modifying the epigenome in the brain affects the normal human aging process by affecting certain genes related to neurogenesis.", "subject": "the epigenome", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 3309429, "title": "Active site-adjacent phosphorylation at Tyr-397 by c-Abl kinase inactivates caspase-9.", "abstract": "Caspase-9 (casp-9) is an initiator caspase and plays a central role in activating apoptotic cell death. Control of all caspases is tightly regulated by a series of phosphorylation events enacted by several different kinases. Caspase-9 is the most heavily phosphorylated of all caspases, with phosphorylation of at least 11 distinct residues in all three caspase-9 domains by nine kinases. Caspase-9 phosphorylation by the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl at Tyr-153 reportedly leads to caspase-9 activation. All other phosphorylation events on caspases have been shown to block proteolytic function by a number of mechanisms, so we sought to unravel the molecular mechanism of the putative caspase-9 activation by phosphorylation. Surprisingly, we observed no evidence for Tyr-153 phosphorylation of caspase-9 in vitro or in cells, suggesting that Tyr-153 is not phosphorylated by c-Abl. Instead, we identified a new site for c-Abl-mediated phosphorylation, Tyr-397. This residue is adjacent to the caspase-9 active site but, as a member of the second shell, not a residue that directly contacts substrate. Our results further indicate that Tyr-397 is the dominant site of c-Abl phosphorylation both in vitro and upon c-Abl activation in cells. Of note, phosphorylation at this site inhibits caspase-9 activity, and the bulk of the added phosphate moiety appeared to directly block substrate binding. c-Abl plays both proapoptotic and prosurvival roles, and our findings suggest that c-Abl's effects on caspase-9 activity promote the prosurvival mode.", "citation_paragraph": "Tyr-397 phosphorylation, casp-6 Cys-264 palmitoylation may result in loss of activity. The L4 has the most diverse sequence among the active-site loops in the apoptotic caspases; thus, posttranslational or targeted modification of L4 could be an amenable method of inhibition, as it might confer added specificity for each caspase.Although the full impacts of Tyr-397 phosphorylation are not known, it is tempting to speculate about the functional impact of this phosphorylation event. A prevalent consequence of phosphorylation is its impact on protein-protein interactions. Phosphorylation can either disrupt or promote binding and in some cases even create a new binding interface. The region where Tyr-397 resides, 395 GIYK 398 , in L4 of casp-9 is involved in crystal contacts (40) , which may suggest that this region could potentially be involved in proteinprotein binding under native conditions as well. Casp-9 is activated by recruitment to the apoptosome via CARD-CARD interactions with Apaf-1 (41). Recently, a structure of the human apoptosome revealed that a monomer of casp-9 core (p20/p10) is \"parked\" on the apoptosome hub, probably in a dynamic manner, independent of the other casp-9 dimer(s) undergoing activation within the CARD-CARD ring (42) . Monomeric casp-9 cores were also reported to bind to the apoptosome by forming a heterodimer with the Apaf-1 nucleotide oligomerization domain via the casp-9 small (p10) subunit (43) . In addition, the apoptosome of Caenorhabditis elegans formed from CED4 and CED3 (homologues of Apaf-1 and casp-9, respectively) shows that the L2\u0408 region of CED3 directly interacts with the oligomerized CED4 and is crucial in the formation of a functional holoenzyme (44) . These observations imply that in addition to the CARD, other regions in casp-9 interact with the apoptosome and potentially influence its activation. Perhaps the Tyr-397 region of the small subunit is involved in direct interactions with the apoptosome, WT or Y397F casp-9 (30 g) were added to lysates to allow casp-9 phosphorylation. WT but not Y397F casp-9 showed phosphorylation in the small (Sm) subunit, which was not visible with imatinib-treated lysates. In some trials, the small subunit of Y397F also appears to be labeled, albeit at a significantly lower level than that of WT (supplemental Fig. S5, B and C) . The phosphorylation observed for CARD\u03e9Large appeared to be c-Abl-independent, because imatinib did not eliminate its phosphorylation. B, c-Abl is activated by DPH in synergy with orthovanadate treatment. HEK 293T cells were treated with DMSO, the known c-Abl-activating compound DPH \u03e9 orthovandate, or imatinib for 2 h. Lysates were probed for active c-Abl as assessed by immunoblotting (IB). Active c-Abl is phosphorylated at Tyr-412. DPH/vanadate treatment clearly resulted in c-Abl activation, as manifested by phosphorylation at Tyr-412 and downstream phosphorylation of a well-known c-Abl substrate, CrkII, at Tyr-221. C, Casp-9 is phosphorylated at Tyr-397 by active c-Abl intracellularly. HEK 293T cells were transfected with vector alone (p3xFLAG-CMV TM -14), catalytic site-inactivated casp-9 (C9 C287A-3xFLAG), or the unphosphorylatable variant (C9 C287A/Y397F-3xFLAG). 24 h post-transfection, cells were treated with DPH/vanadate for 2 h, harvested, and lysed. Immunoblot of total proteins confirmed c-Abl activation and casp-9 expression. Casp-9 was immunoprecipitated from lysates with an anti-FLAG antibody and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine (p-Tyr) and anti-casp-9 by immunoblotting. Cells transfected with C287A/ Y397F showed significantly lower levels of phosphotyrosine in uncleaved caspase-9 compared with those transfected with C287A, although the levels of immunoprecipitated casp-9 in both C287A and C287A/Y397F were similar.", "citance": "Monomeric casp-9 cores were also reported to bind to the apoptosome by forming a heterodimer with the Apaf-1 nucleotide oligomerization domain via the casp-9 small (p10) subunit (43) .", "claims": [{"text": "Monomeric casp-9 cores bind to apoptosome hubs by forming heterodimers with Apaf-1 nucleotide oligomerization domains via the casp-9 small (p10) subunits.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 3430872, "title": "Predictors of Heart Disease Knowledge Among Older and Younger Asian Indian Adults", "abstract": "Coronary heart disease (CHD) has been estimated to be the leading cause of mortality in developing countries in 2010, particularly among Asian Indians. When compared to other populations globally, Asian Indians less than 40 years of age are at an increased risk of myocardial infarction. The objective of this study was to identify the predictors of knowledge of heart disease among younger and older Asian Indians adults. A cross-sectional survey was undertaken in Sydney Australia. One hundred and forty-four participants of Asian Indian descent who attended the health promotion stall at the Australia India Friendship Fair in Sydney participated in the study. All participants completed a self-administered questionnaire. The Primary outcome of the survey was knowledge of heart disease as measured by the 25 item Heart Disease Facts Questionnaire. All six modifiable risk factors for heart disease namely smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, physical inactivity and overweight were identified by 45.2 % of those aged below 40 and 53.5 % of those aged above 40 years of age respectively. For younger adults, only smoking status was significant and was an independently predictor of knowledge related to CHD (b = \u221210.6, p = 0.001, sr2 = 0.16). For older adults, smoking status and duration of residence were significant predictors of knowledge related to CHD (b = \u22127.4, p = 0.000, sr2 = 0.24; b = 0.13, p = 0.001, sr2 = 0.069 respectively). Although suboptimal, there were no statistically significant differences in the level of knowledge among older and younger Asian Indians. Nevertheless, strategies to improve the knowledge of heart disease among this cohort are warranted.", "citation_paragraph": "Heart disease affects young Indians therefore knowledge about heart disease among this cohort is vital. Although numerous studies have reported on knowledge about heart disease among Asian Indians, there is limited literature investigating the knowledge levels of younger and older Asian Indians particularly when Asian Indians less than 40 years of age are at an increased risk of myocardial infarction regardless of whether they live in India or have migrated to another country. Overall, there was no statistically significant difference in knowledge amongst older and younger participants. However, older adults had significantly higher knowledge about diabetes and blood pressure compared to the younger adults. Various reasons could be postulated for these results. Firstly, the incidence of diabetes and blood pressure among the older adults was higher therefore their health literacy levels also could be high as they could be receiving explanation regarding their illness from their health professionals. Only 45.2 % of those aged below 40 and 53.5 % of those aged above 40 years of age identified the six cardiac risk factors, namely smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, physical inactivity and overweight.When compared to other studies reported in the literature [19, 27, 28] , the knowledge levels relating to risk factors for CHD in this study are much higher. For example in a study conducted on 777 participants in Nepal only 29.7 % identified hypertension and 11 % identified overweight and physical activity as causes, whereas only 2.2 % identified high blood sugar as causative factors for CHD [27] . Similarly, limited public knowledge and awareness of CHD have been reported in Jordan [19] and Ireland [28] . Despite extensive advertising and educational campaigns, mainly in English, to stop the use of cigarettes there were still a third of the participants who continued to smoke perhaps suggesting that current educational and public awareness campaigns relating to heart disease are not taken seriously by these participants. While knowledge can enhance the health literacy levels among people, it is well established that ''knowledge'' is not really enough to make people change health behaviors [27] [28] [29] . Other factors such as personal stressors, peer pressure and addiction could be reasons why participants continued to smoke [30] [31] [32] . It is therefore important that along with increasing the knowledge levels, other multiple modalities to assist with smoking cessation are also implemented. Such strategies may include the use of lay people in health promotion programs because they share the same language, culture, and ethnic attributes which provides them with a better understanding of the health needs of their community [33] . The use of pharmacotherapies [34, 35] , telephone counselling [36] , and web-and computer-based smoking cessation programs have been demonstrated to change behaviours relating to smoking [37] .What is interesting is that among both cohorts, those with risk factors for CHD namely history of high blood pressure, high cholesterol and high blood sugar had poor knowledge relating to heart disease. It could be postulated that the knowledge deficits identified could be as a result of ineffective provider communication, low health literacy or poorly targeted messages. This lack of knowledge among those with risk factors for heart disease remains of concern particularly as Asian Indians exhibit higher rates of hypertension and diabetes [38] . It is therefore vital that public health initiatives should include tailored persuasive messages in multiple Indian languages, highlighting the benefits and advantages gained when a behaviour is adopted. Among the younger adults only smoking status was identified as an independent predictor of CHD knowledge while for the older adults smoking status and duration of residence in Australia were significant predictors of CHD knowledge. The result relating to smoking status as a predictor for CHD knowledge is consistent with the literature where participants were more likely to have better CHD knowledge scores if they were non-smokers [19, 28] . Although numerous studies [27, [39] [40] [41] have investigated the determinants of CHD knowledge, duration of residence has not previously been identified as a predictor of higher CHD knowledge. However, it has been well established that longer duration of residence in the adopted country is a risk factor for heart disease [42, 43] . It could be postulated that since the older cohort were residing for a longer period of time in Australia they had more exposure to the health promotion messages which could in turn increase their knowledge of heart disease. Other studies have reported that having tertiary qualifications and being overweight were predictors of CHD knowledge [19, 28] , however in this study both these variables were not found to be predictors of CHD knowledge.The gaps in knowledge surrounding cardiac risk factors that could be treated with medications [44] [45] [46] raises an important question about what is the best method to increase the knowledge of all Asian Indians about heart disease particularly as they are more vulnerable to the condition. It is evident from this study that despite this cohort being well educated, CHD prevention messages may not be reaching this group. These findings suggest that alternate educational approaches are warranted to meet the specific informational needs of minority patients. There is evidence to indicate the presence of low health literacy among patients who require health care the most [47] .Therefore, educational approaches should be developed while keeping in mind issues of health literacy. Efforts should be made to use simple everyday language and be tailored to educate patients as patients largely rely on health professionals for first-hand information. Resources including plain language educational materials in multiple languages must be developed to ensure that information provided is understood. In addition, the methods of education should encourage the patient to clarify information that is provided. In addition to increasing knowledge other behavioural strategies such as motivational interviewing, one-one or group counselling and brief interventions delivered by trained professionals have been reported to reduce risk factors for heart disease [48] . The use of mobile-health and web based technologies to support people in behaviour modification can also serve as an useful adjunct to other strategies [49, 50] .The major strength of the study was the use of a validated questionnaire developed in English specifically for the Indian population to assess heart disease knowledge. The questionnaire was simple and used a true false format which increased the response rates. Despite the results obtained in this study, the limitations inherent in undertaking such a study need to be acknowledged. Firstly the sample size was small and included only those who attended the health promotion stall which may limit the generalizability of our results. Secondly, the length of time the participant had the risk factor was not evaluated and this could have influenced their knowledge of heart disease. In addition, the data collection method is subject to recall and social desirability bias. Another limitation of the study was that the survey was self-administered in English which excluded immigrants mainly the older people who were not able to read English.Improving knowledge relating to heart disease remains an important goal, as it is integral to promoting healthy lifestyles and preventing disease. Further research should include an assessment of health literacy of participants and knowledge relating to heart disease prevention. Research relating to heart disease knowledge among adults under the age of 40 from other populations is warranted in order to provide comparative data.", "citance": "In addition to increasing knowledge other behavioural strategies such as motivational interviewing, one-one or group counselling and brief interventions delivered by trained professionals have been reported to reduce risk factors for heart disease [48] .", "claims": [{"text": "Motivational interviewing, one-one or group counseling and brief interventions by trained professionals do not reduce risk of heart disease.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Motivational interviewing, one-one or group counseling and brief interventions by trained professionals reduces risk of heart disease.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 195657289, "title": "The evolving CRISPR technology", "abstract": null, "citation_paragraph": "Advances in genome editing technology have revolutionized basic and applied biology research in recent years, particularly due to the newly emerged CRISPR/Cas technique (Ren et al., 2017b) . The classical CRISPR/Cas system was derived from a bacterial defense system, which consists of a single guide RNA (sgRNA) for precise targeting and one Cas protein for DNA binding and nuclease activity. Relying on high precision of CRISPR/Cas system, multiple functions have been exploited in addition to original nuclease activity, such as genome base editing, gene knock-down and activation, chromatin imaging systems etc. (Barrangou and Doudna, 2016; Wang and Qi, 2016) . These extensions have demonstrated the flexibility of the CRISPR/Cas system as it has boosted basic biological, biomedical and agricultural research (Shen et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017) . Here we summarize some key events in CRISPR/Cas system development, provide a glimpse of how this technology has transformed biological research, and help you to choose the right tool for your own research (Fig. 1) .CRISPR/Cas system was first introduced into human 293FT cells where it was shown to cleave target sites with high efficiency. The resulting double-stranded breaks (DSBs) in genomic DNA were partially repaired by the indel-forming nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway (Cong et al., 2013) ; therefore indels (insertions/deletions) and base mutations may present within the target site, which could deactivate the target gene and achieve in vivo gene knockout. The convenience and precision of this technique has facilitated its rapid adoption to the genome of a wide range of species, including human, monkey, mouse, rat, fly, zebrafish, Arabidopsis Thaliana and rice and so on. Because its targeting precision and efficiency have been well studied, targeting sites can be designed to minimize off-target binding and maximize on-target efficiency . A recent research identified an advanced xCas9 variant with broad protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) compatibility and high DNA specificity, suggesting that higher editing efficiency, better PAM compatibility and DNA specificity can be achieved at the same time (Hu et al., 2018) . In addition, based on the structure of Cas9, rationally engineered SpCas9-NG variant, also with an increased targeting range (higher activity towards NGD sites than NGC sites), promises a better efficiency over xCas9 at NGD targeting sites and suggests a way to design Cas9 for further optimization (Nishimasu et al., 2018) .Instead of a single sgRNA, a well-purposed sgRNA library could facilitate large-scale functional genomic studies (Shalem et al., 2014; Zhong et al., 2015) , providing a competitive approach to screen key components in biological processes of interest. Tissue-specific, cancer-related, and whole genome-scale libraries have been built to study underlying biological pathways and drug resistance. The application of the low-cost, highly convenient and flexible CRISPR/Cas systems to medical research enables large-scale screenings that reduces total investment in research and development without compromising outcomes.Homology-directed repair (HDR) pathway offers another option for cells to repair DSBs (instead of NHEJ). When a DNA template with a flanking homologous sequence is introduced, cells can repair DSBs with precise recombination at the DSBs site (CRISPR/Cas knock-in system). Utilizing the concept, we could repair the mutations that induce diesease, which propose a bright future in gene therapy Wu et al., 2015) . In the meantime, to study pathology of human genetic diseases, especially polygenic diseases, we could mimic the disease mutations in model organisms easily by using this method, which, otherwise, might be extremely difficult to achieve by other methods. Take one step further, the concept could also be used to add a tag to a target, protein or RNA molecule. It has been shown that mouse models can be generated using \"artificial spermatids\" (Yang et al., 2012) , by integrating with CRISPR/Cas knock-in system, the recently launched genome tagging project (GTP) will provide in vivo tagged mouse models at a researcher's request (Jiang et al., 2018) . This project shows versatility and capability of CRISPR systems and brings in vivo research from the cellular level to the animal level. Based on GTP, a new project, termed protein atlas project (PAP), may be proposed to extend the horizon of GTP by focusing on the in vivo protein-protein interaction networks and spatiotemporal expression patterns on a large scale.Over the past several years, great efforts have been made to innovate in the CRISPR/Cas system, including gene knock-down, activation, evolution, in vivo chromatin imaging, epigenetic modification, base editing and lineage tracing systems. These CRISPR/Cas subsidiaries have promoted multi-dimensional applications of original CRISPR/ Cas system in biological research, and its influences and improvements remain a hot topic.Mutations generated by CRISPR/Cas system can be accumulated over cell divisions, and in combination with the advantages of next generation sequencing (NGS) technology, lineage relations between ancestral progenitors and descendants can be traced based on their mutation patterns. This approach allows us to record lineage information through developmental processes, and drew a lineage tree based on the information, which provides a good intuition of where particular cells are originated from and where they go (McKenna et al., 2016) : it offers a roadmap of cell development on a specific time scale.Gene knock-down and activation systems employ the nuclease-dead Cas enzyme (dCas9), the endonuclease activity of which has been destroyed due to point mutations in the HNH and RuvC domains, to manipulate gene expression in vivo Maeder et al., 2013) . The dCas9/sgRNA functions as a sniper, with versatile bullets such as transcriptional repressors or activators, aimed at the target site. If dCas9 carries repressors (KRAB), it will decrease target gene transcription; and if dCas9 carries activators (VP64 or VP128) or modified sgRNA with MS2-binding site, it will increase expression of its target. Another way to achieve gene knock-down is by CRISPR/Cas13-an RNA-guided RNA-targeting system (Abudayyeh et al., 2017) . CRISPR/Cas13 can cleave target transcripts in vivo with comparable efficiency and improved specificity using its own sgRNA for guidance. In addition, catalytically inactive Cas13a retains its RNA binding activity, and fused with florescent proteins, allows RNA movements in living cells to be tracked.Fused with florescent proteins, dCas9 can be used to visualize the dynamics of coding and noncoding segments of DNA within the host genome (Chen et al., 2013) . For telomeres (which contains large amount of self-repeated sequences), only one or a few sgRNAs are needed; for DNA segments without repeated sequences, more sgRNAs are required to visualize chromatin in vivo. Improved signal/ noise ratio by splitting fluorescent protein or using the SunTag system, makes this imaging system more adaptive and practicable (Tanenbaum et al., 2014) . Overall, the convenience and accuracy of this method eclipse that of traditional fluorescence -in situ-hybridization (FISH) method.Laboratory evolution systems have great potential to generate enhanced genes, such as brighter florescent proteins and higher efficiency Cas enzymes. By coupling a nicking variant of Cas9 (nCas9) with an error-prone DNA polymerase, researchers have acquired EvolvR-an ideal targeted mutagenesis tool (Halperin et al., 2018) , which allows to continuously mutate a target gene with a wide editing window. In addition, CRISPR-X and dCas9-AIDx systems have also been developed to perform gene evolution. Unlike EvolvR, these two utilize coupled cytidine deaminase to generate mutations within a limited editing window (Hess et al., 2016; Ma et al., 2016) .Epigenetic editing has been established as an essential tool for gene regulation. dCas9 fused with the core catalytic domain of the human acetyltransferase p300 or lysine demethylase 1 can increase or decrease histone H3 (H3K27) acetylation of the target site, resulting in expression alterations (Thakore et al., 2016) . Also, Dnmt3a or Tet1 fused dCas9 can increase or decrease CpG methylation levels near the target genomic site, respectively (Liu et al., 2016) . These epigenetic manipulations could be used to investigate relations between epigenetic marks and gene spatiotemporal expressions in a series of key development transitions.Base editing (BE) systems have been developed to tackle the task of correcting single base mutations in a genome, due to avoiding the uncertainty of NHEJ and low efficiency of HDR. Thus, BE systems provide a directional and highly efficient approach to correct disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Currently there are two kinds of base editing systems: ABE for A\u00b7T-to-G\u00b7C editing and BE for C\u00b7G-to-T\u00b7A editing (Gaudelli et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2017; Ren et al., 2017a; Xue et al., 2018) . The ABE system consists of an RNA adenosine deaminase fused nCas9 and a targeting sgRNA, and can introduce base switching more efficiently with a low rate of indel occurrence. The BE system uses cytidine deaminase fused nCas9 to achieve C\u00b7G-to-T\u00b7A editing, with higher efficiency but at the possible cost of causing genomic-scale mutations. The power of such tools has been harnessed to study gene functional regulation (including gain-of-function, increased or decreased gene activity) by inducing point mutations on a whole gene level . Future improvements to fine-tune the efficiency and off-target editing will be crucial for clinical applications of these tools (Koblan et al., 2018; Zuo et al., 2019) .Perhaps the most extraordinary aspect of the CRISPR/ Cas system is how it can transform medical research (Men et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017) . In addition to the previously described genomic manipulation aspects, a new approach using Cas12a has emerged to detect infectious diseases . After the Cas12a-crRNA complex binds and cleaves target dsDNA specifically, its ability to cleave ssDNA is activated. When a cleavable fluorescent reportercoupled ssDNA is provided, this system can detect the existence of first dsDNA cleavage event, i.e. the existence of target disease-related dsDNA. Meanwhile, various methods based on Cas13 have been developed with much higher accuracy and simpler diagnostic procedures (SHERLOCK, SHERLOCKv2, and HUDSON combined SHERLOCK for example) .Indeed, a tool as powerful, versatile and convenient as the CRISPR/Cas system is a gift to biological research. CRISPR/Cas system and its derived systems give us new ways to study the complexity of life (Fig. 1) . Future studies will focus on improving its specificity and efficiency, minimizing its off-target side effects, and also developing new derivations and applications.", "citance": "It has been shown that mouse models can be generated using \"artificial spermatids\" (Yang et al., 2012) , by integrating with CRISPR/Cas knock-in system, the recently launched genome tagging project (GTP) will provide in vivo tagged mouse models at a researcher's request (Jiang et al., 2018) .", "claims": [{"text": "Mouse models can be generated using \"artificial spermatids.\"", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 199491832, "title": "The biogenesis, biology and characterization of circular RNAs", "abstract": "Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are covalently closed, endogenous biomolecules in eukaryotes with tissue-specific and cell-specific expression patterns, whose biogenesis is regulated by specific cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors. Some circRNAs are abundant and evolutionarily conserved, and many circRNAs exert important biological functions by acting as microRNA or protein inhibitors (\u2018sponges\u2019), by regulating protein function or by being translated themselves. Furthermore, circRNAs have been implicated in diseases such as diabetes mellitus, neurological disorders, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Although the circular nature of these transcripts makes their detection, quantification and functional characterization challenging, recent advances in high-throughput RNA sequencing and circRNA-specific computational tools have driven the development of state-of-the-art approaches for their identification, and novel approaches to functional characterization are emerging. In eukaryotes, circular RNAs (circRNAs) carry out important biological roles by acting as microRNA or protein sponges, regulating protein function or through cap-independent translation. New technologies for identifying and characterizing circRNAs will increase our knowledge of their biogenesis and function in health and disease.", "citation_paragraph": ") and exported to the cytoplasm (step 1), where it functions as a sponge for the tumour suppressor miRNA miR-7 (it has >70 conserved miR-7 binding sites) (step 2). Binding of miR-671 to ciRS-7 facilitates cleavage of the circRNA by AGO2 (step 3), leading to the degradation of ciRS-7 and the release of miR-7 (step 4), which is then free to suppress its target genes (step 5). ciRS-7 is overexpressed in several human malignancies (step 6), leading to the increased translation of miR-7 target genes, such as EGFR and RAF (step 7), which activates the MAPK signalling pathway and increases proliferative signalling and metastasis (step 8). b | circRNAs can act as protein sponges in the absence of viral infection. When cells are virus-free, NF90/NF110 promotes circRNA biogenesis in general by stabilizing intronic RNA secondary structures and thus backsplicing (step 1). The newly synthesized circRNAs are exported to the cytoplasm (step 2) and bound by splicing factors (SFs) and RNA binding proteins (RBPs), which mark them as 'self' molecules by preventing RIG-I pattern recognition receptors from binding to them (step 3). Within the cytoplasm, circRNAs may also function as a molecular reservoir of the antiviral proteins NF90/NF110 and PKR (step 4). Upon viral infection, NF90/NF110 translocates to the cytoplasm; a decrease in nuclear NF90/NF110 promotes a global reduction in circRNA biogenesis (step 5), and circ RNA-bound NF90/NF110 and PKR are released and bind to viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) for a rapid antiviral immune response that involves the phosphorylation (P) of PKR (step 6). Finally , immune signalling can also be stimulated by RIG-I binding to viral circRNAs (step 7). \u25c0 Nature reviews | Genetics have linear counterparts that can interfere with data interpretation; conversely, abundant circRNAs may interfere with the study of linear transcripts derived from the same locus. For instance, studies showing that the long non-coding RNA RMST regulates pluripotency and neurogenesis unknowingly knocked out the linear and circular RMST transcript 126, 127 ; subsequent studies showed that the predominant form of RMST is circular 22 . Here, we discuss methods that can be used to characterize circRNAs (Fig. 5) .Methods for characterizing circRNA-miRNA interactions. It can be challenging to prove that a circRNA functions as a miRNA sponge; the presence of putative miRNA binding sites in circRNAs does not necessarily indicate that the circRNA inhibits these miRNAs. Indeed, the stoichiometric relationship between the miRNA binding sites in the potential sponge and in the target mRNA should be considered; a notable decrease in target mRNA repression may require the circRNA to have many competing miRNA binding sites 104, 105 . Experimental data, preferably collected using Argonaute-crosslinking and immunoprecipitation or Argonaute immunoprecipitation, are required to prove that a circRNA has a bona fide miRNA sponging function. However, although data derived using these techniques provide high confidence of an association between Ago proteins and RNA, they do not discriminate between circRNA and linear RNA. Thus, the circRNA or circRNAs should be quantified using a circRNA-specific approach such as RT-qPCR with divergent primer design. However, co-immunoprecipitation of Ago and the circRNA and miRNA of interest is not indisputable evidence that a circRNA acts as a miRNA sponge; the circRNA-Ago association must be sensitive to perturbation of miRNA levels, and the expression level of endogenous targets and the activity of reporter assays should be increased and decreased by the overexpression and depletion of the circRNA, respectively (Fig. 5a ).Methods for characterizing circRNA-protein interactions. Methods to assess circRNA-protein interactions are based on the isolation of a circRNA (RNA-centric) or a protein (protein-centric), followed by the analysis of the interaction partners of the isolated component. As these techniques and the challenges associated with them have been discussed in detail elsewhere 128, 129 , we focus on specific issues related to the study of circRNA-protein interactions.In RNA-centric approaches, antisense probes targeting the circRNA of interest are used to pull down the circRNA and associated proteins from the cell lysate using techniques such as RNA antisense purification, comprehensive identification of RBPs or capture hybridization analysis of RNA targets 93, 95, 128 . As the only unique region of a circRNA is the BSJ, the identity of the isolated circRNA must be confirmed. As previously demonstrated 93, 95 , a single BSJ-spanning probe can pull down the circRNA of interest. Alternatively, probes targeting the circRNA at any position can be used if the cell lysate is treated with RNase R or with a poly(A)-selection kit to remove linear RNAs before pulldown. circRNA-associated proteins can be analysed using low-throughput methods such as western blotting or high-throughput methods such as mass spectrometry (Fig. 5b) .To identify circRNAs associated with a protein of interest 130 , an antibody against the protein can be used for co-immunoprecipitation of RNA. circRNAs interacting with the protein can then be analysed by locusspecific methods or by high-throughput methods such as RNA-seq. To map the exact protein-binding sites on circRNAs using crosslinking immunoprecipitation (CLIP)-based methods 128 , linear RNA must be efficiently removed before immunoprecipitation.Methods for studying the translation of circRNAs. Most circRNAs are produced from protein-coding genes and putative ORFs in circRNAs often overlap with the canonical ORFs in the corresponding mRNA sequences 7, 15 . Therefore, only the sequence downstream of the BSJ and before the putative STOP codon is useful in determining whether a protein is derived from the linear or circular transcript (Fig. 5c ). In addition, circRNAs are often expressed at lower levels than the corresponding mRNAs, making it challenging to determine First, bioinformatics approaches should be used to assess for the presence of miRNA binding sites in the circRNA of interest. A physical interaction between the circRNA , miRNA and AGO2 should then be confirmed using Argonaute immunoprecipitation or Argonaute-crosslinking and immunoprecipitation; the circRNA or circRNAs identified should be quantified using a circRNA-specific approach, such as reverse transcription and quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) with a divergent primer design. Finally , the level of endogenous miRNA target genes (not shown) and the activity of reporter assays upon the overexpression and depletion of the circRNA should be assessed. b | circRNAprotein interactions can be characterized using a proteincentric or RNA-centric approach. In the protein-centric approach, an antibody against the protein of interest pulls down RNA transcripts, which can be identified by RNA sequencing. In the RNA-centric approach, biotin-labelled antisense oligos (probes) targeting either the backsplice junction (BSJ) of the circRNA of interest or that cover the entire circRNA sequence are used. RNA-protein complexes can be pulled down using streptavidin-coated beads. When using multiple probes, ribonuclease (RNase) R treatment or polyadenylation (poly(A)) selection is used to remove linear polyadenylated transcripts. Following isolation of the complexes, the proteins can be detected by western blotting or mass spectrometry. c | Selected methods for studying the translation of circRNAs. First, the identification of an open reading frame (ORF) and functional internal ribosome entry site (IRES) elements by luciferase reporters is advisable. Then, the circRNA-derived peptide should be detected using western blotting or mass spectrometry (not shown). When no specific antibody against the circRNA-specific part of the peptide is available, tagging the circRNA ORF (for example, with GFP or a FL AG tag) allows it to be detected in subsequent assays.

The results obtained have shown that vitamin C exerts effects which are tissue specific. In hypothalamus, it decreased the activity of copper zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), the concentration of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), as well as the activity of catalase and the level of lipid peroxidation, thus causing effects which are obviously antioxidative. On the other hand, the changes detected in adrenals indicate that vitamin C there performs some other, specific functions. They are followed by an increase in the activity of both CuZnSOD and MnSOD, as well as with the consequent rise of H2O2 content. However, these changes seem not to be of pro-oxidative nature since the level of lipid peroxidation in adrenals remains unchanged as compared to the controls.", "citation_paragraph": "Vitamin C (ascorbic acid, ascorbate) is a vitamin which takes part in many biochemical processes in organism. Chemically capable of reacting with most of the physiologically important radicals and oxidants (Buettner 1993) it acts as a proven hydrosoluble antioxidant (Halliwell 1996) . Another important biological function of ascorbate is to serve as a cosubstrate for several hydroxylase and oxygenase enzymes, maintaining their active center metal ions in a reduced state for optimal enzyme activity (Carr and Frei 1999) . One of these enzymes is dopamine \u03b2-hydroxylase (DBH), which in different neuroendocrine tissues synthesizes noradrenaline through hydroxylation of dopamine (Diliberto et al. 1987) . It is known that the level of the DBH activity highly depends on the intracellular vitamin C content (Levine 1986) , which, in turn, depends on the activity of members of the family of mammalian Na + -dependent L-ascorbic acid plasma membrane transporters (Tsukaguchi et al. 1999) . There are two types of these transporters, SVCT1 and SVCT2 (Daruwala et al. 1999) , and the latter is widely expressed in the brain and adrenals (Liang et al. 2001) . It has been shown that mutant mice lacking SVCT2 have severely reduced (99%) ascorbic acid levels in both brain and adrenals (Sotiriou et al. 2002) . While this fall in vitamin C concentration shows no implication on the brain levels of dopamine and noradrenaline, it causes marked reduction in adrenal level of DBH activity; it seems that deranged catecholamine system function in SVCT2 null mice is largely restricted to the adrenal medulla (Bornstein et al. 2003) .According to previously mentioned, we assumed that the same tissue-specific response of hypothalamus and adrenals could be achieved even in normal rats, as a result of increased vitamin C supply. Since the activity of DBH involves the accumulation of an activated oxygen intermediate, with the properties of a copper-peroxo or copper-oxo species (Evans et al. 2003) , we decided to study the oxidative status of rats supplemented by two different doses of ascorbic acid over a four-week period of time. Thus, the activities of copper zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and catalase, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) concentration, the level of lipid peroxidation and vitamin C content were determined in the hypothalamus and adrenal glands of the experimental animals, as well as their serum vitamin C level.", "citance": "It has been shown that mutant mice lacking SVCT2 have severely reduced (99%) ascorbic acid levels in both brain and adrenals (Sotiriou et al. 2002) .", "claims": [{"text": "Mutant mice lacking SVCT2 have greatly increased ascorbic acid levels in both brain and adrenals.", "subject": "Mutant mice lacking SVCT2", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Mutant mice lacking SVCT2 have severely reduced ascorbic acid levels in both brain and adrenals.

However, the direct connection between genomic mutations and the regulation of protein states remains elusive. In a recent paper published in Nature, Brockmann and colleagues utilized gene-trap mutagenesis approach coupled with antibody staining for proteins of interest to execute a series of genetic screens in human haploid HAP1 cells, aiming to investigate the direct link between genomic perturbations and specific protein phenotypes (6) .Technically, the gene-trap mutagenized HAP1 cells (5) were treated to induce desired signaling pathways or directly harvested, followed by fixation, permeabilization, staining with primary antibody specific to protein of interest and fluorophore conjugated secondary antibody, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to obtain two cell populations with low signal and high signal respectively. Then the positive/negative regulators of examined protein state can be identified by comparing the disruptive integrations in either the high-or low-query populations. With the availability of specific antibodies, the authors were able to assess a variety of protein states related to a suite of cellular processes, including signaling transduction (Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and interferon signaling pathways), post-transcriptional (splicing) and posttranslational modifications (protein phosphorylation, methylation, crotonylation, and glycosylation), and successfully captured known and novel modifiers of the protein states. Interestingly, the same screening approach was recently employed to identify the regulators of the programmed death-1 (PD-1) ligand 1 (PD-L1) protein (7), which is exploited by cancer cells to evade T-cell-mediated immunosurveillance. Importantly, the authors made all processed screen results accessible in an interactive database (https://phenosaurus.nki.nl), thus providing very useful resources to researchers with broad interest.Subsequently, the authors performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to assess the gene expression levels in HAP1 cells, and observed a positive correlation between the gene's transcription level and its likelihood of regulating protein phenotypes. Comprehensive genetic network analysis further revealed that chromatin-modifying enzymes, such as PRC2 complex, contribute to the regulation of a variety of protein phenotypes, whereas most other regulators are contributors to the specific query trait.Having proved the power of the genetic wiring screen system, the authors were particularly interested in further understanding the AKT signaling cascade, which is a fundamental pathway for regulating cell proliferation, survival, among others (8) , by assessing the phosphorylation of AKT at S473 site (pAKT-S473). The success of the screen was first confirmed by the identification of many known negative (for example, PTEN, INPPL1, and INPP4A) and positive (for example, AKT2, AKT3, RICTOR, and MAPKAP1) factors affecting pAKT-S473. Among the previously unrevealed regulators of pAKT-S473, the authors identified the cullin E3 ligase CUL3 as well as its substrate adaptor KCTD5 as potent negative regulators Editorial Haploid genetic screens identify key regulators of protein phenotypes and signaling transduction in HAP1 cells, the phenotype of which can be further validated in additional cell line models by assessing the pAKT-S473 levels. Interestingly, the increased pAKT-S473 level in KCTD5-deficient cells is not attributed to the alteration in the canonical AKT cascade components such as PTEN and RICTOR (9), suggesting an alternative route controlling the AKT signaling. To further understand the mechanism of action of KCTD5, the authors applied the same screen strategy in KCTD5-deficient HAP1 cells, and were able to identify a class of genes as potent positive regulators of pAKT-S473 exclusively in KCTD5-deficient cells, including G-protein \u03b2 and \u03b3 subunits (GNB1, GNB2, and GNG5), their chaperone protein PDCL which is required to generate G\u03b2\u03b3 dimers, as well as their downstream effector PI3KCB. This observation suggested a G\u03b2\u03b3 signaling dependent regulatory mechanism of pAKT-S473 by KCTD5.To demonstrate the potential KCTD5-G\u03b2\u03b3-pAKT-S473 axis, the authors employed the unbiased quantitative proteomics approaches to identify proteins whose abundance and ubiquitination can be increased and reduced, respectively, upon loss of KCTD5, leading to the identification of GNB1, GNB2, and GNG5, encoding G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits. To further determine the cellular context in which KCTD5 regulates the degradation of G\u03b2\u03b3, the authors again applied their haploid genetic screen strategy in both wild type (WT) and KCTD5-deficienct cells with GNB1 as the readout, revealing the G\u03b1 subunits and the corresponding chaperone protein RIC8A (10,11) as positive regulators of GNB1 level in a KCTD5-dependent manner. Using co-immunoprecipitation assays, the authors confirmed that KCTD5 competes with G\u03b1 subunits to bind G\u03b2\u03b3 dimers, leading to the degradation. Interestingly, multiple mutations in G\u03b2 proteins GNB1 and GNB2 have been recently identified in a variety of cancers, resulting in the loss of interaction with G\u03b1 subunits and concomitant activation of AKT pathway (12) . The authors were able to demonstrate that these mutated G\u03b2 proteins also lost their capability to bind KCTD5.Altogether in this study, Brockmann and colleagues have successfully adapted a powerful haploid genetic screen approach to assess specific protein phenotypes, expanding the understanding of regulation of a variety of signaling cascades. The closely related genetic suppressor screen in cells deficient in specific gene provides a robust platform to investigate the underlying mechanism associated with specific protein phenotypes. However, the success of this screening approach largely relies on the availability, quality, and specificity of antibodies recognizing proteins of interest, limiting its broader application. An alternative route to bypass this issue could be the utilization of CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene tagging, such as fluorescent protein like GFP, to the genomic locus of interest (13) . The identification of KCTD5 as an off-switch for GPCR signaling expanded the understanding of how GPCR signaling can be tightly regulated. Although the authors established the KCTD5-G\u03b2\u03b3-AKT regulatory axis, whether KCTD5 has any implications in diseases or cancers still awaits further investigation.", "citance": "Interestingly, multiple mutations in G\u03b2 proteins GNB1 and GNB2 have been recently identified in a variety of cancers, resulting in the loss of interaction with G\u03b1 subunits and concomitant activation of AKT pathway (12) .", "claims": [{"text": "Mutations in G-Beta protein GNB1 are present in many cancers, resulting in loss of interaction with G-alpha subunits and concomitant activation of AKT pathway.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Mutations in G-Beta protein GNB2 are present in many cancers, resulting in loss of interaction with G-alpha subunits and concomitant activation of AKT pathway.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 16829050, "title": "Activator of Meiosis-Specific Genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae", "abstract": null, "citation_paragraph": "In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the choice between meiosis-sporulation and alternative developmental pathways such as the mitotic cell cycle, pseudohyphae growth, or G 1 arrest depends on the expression and activity of a master regulator, Ime1p. This is deduced from the observation that cells deleted for IME1 are sporulation deficient and arrest in meiosis at G 1 prior to any meiotic event, i.e., transcription of meiosis-specific genes, premeiotic DNA replication, meiotic recombination, and nuclear divisions (15, 49) . IME1 encodes a transcriptional activator (23, 48) that is recruited to the promoters of early meiosis-specific genes by interacting with a sequence-specific DNA binding protein, Ume6p (41) .Initiation of meiosis depends on two signals: starvation for nutrients and the presence of MATa1 and MAT\u24232 gene products (17) . The nutrient signal is required at several levels: for the transcription of IME1 (15) , for the translation of IME1 mRNA (47) , for the association of Ime1p with its meiotic target, Ume6p (41) , and for entry into the first meiotic division (21) . The MAT signal is also required in more than one step: for the transcription of IME1 and for efficient meiosis (15, 47) . The purpose of this study has been to identify the elements in IME1 that are required for its regulated transcription and to determine the role of the RAS-cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (cAPK) pathway in the activity of the regulated upstream activating sequence (UAS) elements. Therefore, we shall summarize below the known information concerning the transcription of IME1.Transcripts of IME1 are not detected in the presence of glucose, and a low basal level is present in vegetative acetate media (15) . Upon nitrogen depletion the level of IME1 mRNA increases in MATa/MAT\u2423 diploids, reaching a peak at about 6 to 8 h and then declining (15, 49) . The transcription of IME1 is not induced in cells that do not carry both the MATa1 and MAT\u24232 alleles (MAT-insufficient cells) (15, 49) .Very little is known about the organization of the IME1 locus. The sequence of IME1 identifies three putative TATA boxes: TATATTA at \u03ea353, TATTTAA at \u03ea330, and TATA AAT at \u03ea158. Deletions of these TATA boxes revealed that the functional TATA is at \u03ea330 (1). Accordingly, the main transcription initiation site of IME1 RNA was mapped to \u03ea229 (1, 47) . The complete genomic sequence of S. cerevisiae reveals that upstream of IME1 there is an extremely large region, 4,122 bp long, that is devoid of open reading frames, tRNA, or rRNA. This suggests the possibility that a large region may be involved in the transcriptional regulation of IME1. Indeed, previous reports have pointed to this phenomenon (5, 12) . Covitz and Mitchell reported that the region between \u03ea2243 and \u03ea1743 upstream of IME1 ATG carries a negative element that prevents the expression of IME1 in MATa/MATa cells (5) . Furthermore, a 21-bp element (RRE) located at base pair \u03ea2024 to \u03ea2044 binds Rme1p (5), a zinc finger protein that represses the transcription of IME1 in MAT-insufficient cells (15, 16, 37) . The regulated region may extend even further, since multiple copies of IME1 sequences from \u03ea3166 to \u03ea3762 promote sporulation in both the presence of nutrients and in MATa/MATa diploids (12) .Except for Rme1p, the transcriptional activators and repressors that directly affect the transcription of IME1 are unknown. Nonetheless, several genes that affect the transcription of IME1 have been identified. IME4 encodes a positive regulator that is absolutely required for the transcription of IME1 (44) . The transcription of IME4 is induced only in MATa/MAT\u2423 diploids that are shifted to nitrogen-depleted medium (44) , suggesting that Ime4p transmits both MAT and nitrogen signals. IME4 does not encode a DNA binding protein, and its mode of action is not known. The third gene that mediates MAT regulation to IME1 is RES1; a dominant mutation, RES1-1, promotes sporulation of MAT-insufficient diploids (14) . RES1 has yet to be cloned, but epistasis tests suggest that it acts in a pathway distinct from either Ime4p or Rme1p (14, 44) . The nitrogen depletion signal seems to be transmitted to IME1 via the RAS-cAPK pathway: mutations that cause lower activity of cAPK, such as cdc25, ras2, and cyr1, lead to the expression of IME1 and to meiosis in the presence of nitrogen (references 26, 27, and 49 and references therein). On the other hand, mutations that cause constitutive activity of cAPK, such as RAS2-val19 and bcy1, are sporulation deficient and are suppressed by overexpression of IME1 (27) . Mutations in several genes lower the level of IME1 RNA; these include the serine-threonine protein kinase MCK1 (34) and the DNA binding protein RIM1 (50) and its proteolytic cleavage regulators RIM8, RIM9, and RIM13 (22, 51) .In this paper we report a systematic analysis of the 5\u0408 untranslated region of IME1 and identify the elements that are required for its regulated transcription. We show that IME1 is regulated by an unusually large region that is composed of alternate negative and positive elements. Our analysis reveals the presence of distinct elements responding to MAT, carbon, and nitrogen regulation. We demonstrate that the RAS-cAPK pathway transmits a glucose signal to one of the regulated UAS elements, IREu.

{"s2orc_id": 38482041, "title": "Label-Free Neurosurgical Pathology with Stimulated Raman Imaging.", "abstract": "The goal of brain tumor surgery is to maximize tumor removal without injuring critical brain structures. Achieving this goal is challenging as it can be difficult to distinguish tumor from nontumor tissue. While standard histopathology provides information that could assist tumor delineation, it cannot be performed iteratively during surgery as freezing, sectioning, and staining of the tissue require too much time. Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy is a powerful label-free chemical imaging technology that enables rapid mapping of lipids and proteins within a fresh specimen. This information can be rendered into pathology-like images. Although this approach has been used to assess the density of glioma cells in murine orthotopic xenografts models and human brain tumors, tissue heterogeneity in clinical brain tumors has not yet been fully evaluated with SRS imaging. Here we profile 41 specimens resected from 12 patients with a range of brain tumors. By evaluating large-scale stimulated Raman imaging data and correlating this data with current clinical gold standard of histopathology for 4,422 fields of view, we capture many essential diagnostic hallmarks for glioma classification. Notably, in fresh tumor samples, we observe additional features, not seen by conventional methods, including extensive lipid droplets within glioma cells, collagen deposition in gliosarcoma, and irregularity and disruption of myelinated fibers in areas infiltrated by oligodendroglioma cells. The data are freely available in a public resource to foster diagnostic training and to permit additional interrogation. Our work establishes the methodology and provides a significant collection of reference images for label-free neurosurgical pathology.

The lipids comprising myelin yielded strong SRS signals (colored green). Thus, white matter regions of the brain, which have abundant myelin lipids, appeared green in our SRS images and gray matter regions, which contain more cell bodies, appeared blue due to their higher relative protein composition. These striking patterns can be seen in Fig. 1D that shows an SRS image of fresh (i.e., unfrozen) brain tissue at the gray and white matter junction from a portion of brain tissue removed from an epilepsy patient with focal cortical dysplasia (case 43). The margin between white and gray matter was clearly identified with submicron spatial resolution ($400-500 nm). Single myelinated axon fibers were visualized and traced in the transition zone from white matter to gray matter (Fig. 1D, right) . Blood vessels appeared blue due to the high protein content of both the cells of the vessel walls, and the blood contents in the vessel lumen. (Fig. 1D , one example marked by a \"V\").To further evaluate the contrasts, we imaged sections from frozen autopsy brain samples with SRS that contained both normal gray and white matter (Fig. 1E, left, case A1) . We then stained the identical slices with H&E (Fig. 1E, middle) and a serial section with LFB (Fig. 1E, right) to permit direct comparisons between SRS images and images acquired using standard microscopy techniques. We observed the striking contrast between gray and white matter in these frozen sections (Fig. 1E, left) and also identified single myelinated axon fibers (Fig. 1F) . The SRS images acquired from frozen tissues contained artifacts that were similar to those typically observed in H&E-stained sections. These artifacts included disruption of the myelin signal along the length of the axon fibers as well as distortion and interspersed cracks (Fig.  1F) . Similar artifacts are not present in SRS images of fresh, unfrozen tissues.We next imaged an additional piece of frozen brain tissue, scanning a region 7 mm in length. We quantified the intensity profile of the SRS signals and demonstrated that the lipid signal was approximately 2-fold stronger in the white matter (left) than in the gray matter (right; Fig. 1G ). In contrast, the protein signal in the gray matter was only slightly higher than the protein signal in the white matter. SRS and H&E-stained images showed clear correlation at the subcellular level. However, the visual differences between gray and white matter areas in the images from H&E-stained sections were less obvious than the marked molecular differences captured by SRS imaging. Our results open new possibilities for using high-resolution SRS imaging of myelin and various lipids to characterize both healthy tissues and those characteristic of focal cortical dysplasias, and adult and pediatric demyelinating diseases (38) .We then applied our SRS imaging approach to characterize a range of tissue types obtained during brain tumor resections. These tissue samples included tissues from resections of gliomas of different WHO grades such as WHO grade II oligodendroglioma, WHO grade III anaplastic oligodendroglioma and anaplastic oligoastrocytoma, and WHO grade IV glioblastoma including one case of gliosarcoma (Supplementary Table  S1 ). Figure 2A shows the SRS image of an entire frozen biopsy specimen taken during the surgical resection of an anaplastic oligodendroglioma (WHO grade III; case 15, specimen B2,). A large region of the specimen (Fig. 2A, left, upper part of the SRS image) generated strong lipid signals (green) due to an abundance of myelinated axon fibers, whereas another large region of the specimen (Fig. 2A, left , lower bottom part of the SRS image) generated strong protein signals (blue). The presence of infiltrating glioma cells in both of these regions was observed in the SRS image, which was validated by review of the H&E staining ( Fig. 2A, right) . Again, the boundary between the gray matter and the white matter was clearer in the SRS images than in images obtained from H&E-stained sections (Fig. 2 ) in which lipids have been largely removed during sample processing. Identification of the nuclei from individual cells, however, is robust in both SRS and H&E-stained sections (Fig. 2B) . Regions of microhemorrhages that occur during the biopsy procedure were also well visualized in both SRS and H&E-stained images ( Fig. 2A) . In the SRS images, red blood cells appear cyan colored because of the non-Raman two-photon two-color absorption by these cells (Fig. 2A , left, two regions of microhemorrhage marked by V).", "citance": "Myelin sheaths are a lipid-rich cellular structure that surround axons and play important roles in axonal insulation, action potential propagation, and trophic support (37) .", "claims": [{"text": "Myelin sheaths are lipid-rich cellular structures.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Myelin sheaths play a role in action potential propagation.

Here, we review the progress of genome projects in non-Drosophila arthropods, focusing on advances in the analysis of large-scale polymorphism data and functional genomics and examples of population genomic studies.", "citation_paragraph": "We found 135 completed or ongoing arthropod genome projects registered with the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, circa June, 2014). Of these 135 genome projects, 57 belong to Dipteran species (flies and mosquitos). The remaining 77 genome projects are distributed among several insect orders, including the Hymenoptera (bees, wasp and ants), the Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), the Coleoptera (beetles) and the Hemiptera (true bugs), although there is clear overrepresentation of hymenopteran genomes among non-dipteran insects. Beside insects, there are several genome projects of Chelicerata (spiders, scorpions and mites) and some Crustacean (e.g. the ostracod Daphnia pulex).Myriapods are the most basal of the four major extant arthropode clades, and the recently published Centipede genome will provide new insights on the key genetic and phenotypic innovations that facilitated subterranean life [20] . The number of new insect genomes sequenced per year appears to be exponentially increasing since 2000, with the most remarkable increase recorded in 2013 ( Figure 2 ). This peak coincided with the release of the first insect genomes from the i5k initiative, a coordinated effort to sequence up to 5000 insect genomes in the next few years [21] .Multiple genome comparisons have allowed researchers to discover and better annotate genes and to identify, for example, lineage-specific gene (or gene family) gains or losses associated with the amazing phenotypic differences observed between different insect lineages or conserved noncoding sequences that are likely important for gene regulation in insect genomes [22] [23] [24] . The importance of DNA methylation and phenotypic evolution in social insects (e.g. caste determination) has been also emphasized by comparative genomics [25] [26] [27] , as well as the important role of non-protein coding elements (e.g. micro RNAs [28] ). Within the Hymenoptera, several genome projects of species representing different levels of social organization are currently under way, providing novel insights into the evolutionary processes leading to eusociality. Another initiative focuses on the evolution of parasitic life styles that independently evolved many times within insects.Advances in methods for high-throughput genome analysis HTS methods [29] have many useful applications for studying the genomics of non-model arthropods. Modern HTS technologies deliver a large amount of data; at present, for example, a single lane of Illumina HiSeq 2500 delivers about 300 million reads (average read length 160 bp) for a total length of 50 Gbp (billions of base pairs). For the smallest arthropod genomes (about 100 Mbp [30] ), this corresponds to an impressive coverage of 500\u00c2. Arthropod genome sizes vary by more than an order of magnitude: consequently, the most effective de novo sequencing strategy will depend on genome size. For small genomes, it would be cost-effective to sequence a pool of individuals in a single lane, whereas for genomes larger than a few hundred Mb, sequencing each individual separately would be most effective.HTS strategies for population genetics are based on resequencing several individuals from a population. The reads are either mapped to the reference genome or, if it is not available, Beyond fruit-flies | 425 clustered into small scaffolds. Calling genetic variants, typically single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), from the aligned sequences are the starting point for subsequent population genetics analyses, and few of them (e.g. phylogenetic reconstruction, average nucleotide diversity, inference of demography and migration rates between populations) can be performed without SNP data mapping to a reference sequence. However, most population genetics methods aim at detecting genomic regions under selection (e.g. genomic scans [31] ) and therefore require the knowledge of the location of SNPs along the genome, including their coding context; these methods require alignment to a reference genome. If the species of interest lacks an annotated reference genome, the alternatives are either to obtain a genome by de novo sequencing combined with automatic or semiautomatic annotation, or to use the annotated reference genome of the closest species available as used in the Drosophila miranda genome project [32] . Sequencing individuals separately and aligning them to the reference genome of a close species is the most immediate approach for population genetic studies. There are two different strategies for the choice of the appropriate read depth [33] . For studies that do not use haplotype information, a low coverage (2-4\u00c2 per individual) is often sufficient for standard population genetics analyses, provided that the sample size is large enough (tens of individuals). For studies that focus on haplotype tests or specific mutations, a moderate to high coverage (8-20\u00c2 per individual) is advised. Above this coverage, it is convenient to increase the number of individuals sequenced rather than the coverage per individual [33] .", "citance": "Beside insects, there are several genome projects of Chelicerata (spiders, scorpions and mites) and some Crustacean (e.g. the ostracod Daphnia pulex).Myriapods are the most basal of the four major extant arthropode clades, and the recently published Centipede genome will provide new insights on the key genetic and phenotypic innovations that facilitated subterranean life [20] .", "claims": [{"text": "Myriapods are the most basal clade of the four major extant arthropode clades.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 27971986, "title": "An integrative strategy to identify the entire protein coding potential of prokaryotic genomes by proteogenomics.", "abstract": "Accurate annotation of all protein-coding sequences (CDSs) is an essential prerequisite to fully exploit the rapidly growing repertoire of completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes. However, large discrepancies among the number of CDSs annotated by different resources, missed functional short open reading frames (sORFs), and overprediction of spurious ORFs represent serious limitations. Our strategy toward accurate and complete genome annotation consolidates CDSs from multiple reference annotation resources, ab initio gene prediction algorithms and in silico ORFs (a modified six-frame translation considering alternative start codons) in an integrated proteogenomics database (iPtgxDB) that covers the entire protein-coding potential of a prokaryotic genome. By extending the PeptideClassifier concept of unambiguous peptides for prokaryotes, close to 95% of the identifiable peptides imply one distinct protein, largely simplifying downstream analysis. Searching a comprehensive Bartonella henselae proteomics data set against such an iPtgxDB allowed us to unambiguously identify novel ORFs uniquely predicted by each resource, including lipoproteins, differentially expressed and membrane-localized proteins, novel start sites and wrongly annotated pseudogenes. Most novelties were confirmed by targeted, parallel reaction monitoring mass spectrometry, including unique ORFs and single amino acid variations (SAAVs) identified in a re-sequenced laboratory strain that are not present in its reference genome. We demonstrate the general applicability of our strategy for genomes with varying GC content and distinct taxonomic origin. We release iPtgxDBs for B. henselae, Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens and Escherichia coli and the software to generate both proteogenomics search databases and integrated annotation files that can be viewed in a genome browser for any prokaryote.", "citation_paragraph": "We present a flexible, yet general proteogenomics strategy that allowed us to identify novelties in the genome of prokaryotes of different taxonomic origin (\u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b3-proteobacteria) and widely ranging GC content. Investing a major effort in a preprocessing step to hierarchically integrate reference genome annotations and predictions into an iPtgxDB that covers the entire protein-coding potential pays off: Close to 95% of the peptides unambiguously imply one protein (based on an extension of the PeptideClassifier concept for prokaryotes), facilitating swift data analysis and mining. In addition, informative identifiers capture overlap and differences of all resources, start codon, and genomic coordinate information, such that novel ORFs, start sites, or expressed pseudogenes can readily be identified and visualized. These features are unique to our solution. Our iPtgxDBs come in the form of a protein search DB and a GFF file containing all annotations and identifiers.For prokaryotes, the complexity of iPtgxDBs is lower than that of a regular protein search DB for, e.g., yeast or human (Supplemental Table S2 ). In our view, the benefit of generating a single iPtgxDB against which proteomics data from any condition (or knockout strain) can be searched to identify novel ORFs outweighs that of other elegant solutions that were developed for the more complex eukaryotes. Both splice graphs (Woo et al. 2013 ) and RNA-seq data (Wang et al. 2012) reduce the complexity and size of the search DB. However, in both cases, DBs specific for the conditions studied are generated, requiring bioinformatics expertise and limiting the general applicability of the resource. The GFF file we provide can be very valuable for other proteogenomics software solutions like GenoSuite (Kumar et al. 2013) , PGP (Tovchigrechko et al. 2014) , and PG Nexus (Pang et al. 2014) , which allow users to search their data against a six-frame translation and later visualize identified peptides onto a genome sequence but lack integrated and consolidated annotations.The proteogenomics community is still to agree upon the best practice for required FDR thresholds and confirmation of novel candidates. Using very stringent FDR thresholds, as also advocated by Venter et al. (2011) , we show that the E-value distributions of PSMs for novel hits and target proteins are similar. Furthermore, we invested an extra effort to confirm the expression of novel ORFs with selective and sensitive PRM assays. The validation RefSeq and Ensembl annotate it as a pseudogene, Genoscope as a fragmented pseudogene, while Prodigal and ChemGenome predict two CDSs. The reference genome (below gray virtual genome bar; NCBI RefSeq track) differs from the MQB277 assembly (MQB277 track above the virtual genome) by an insertion of 81 bp and a 1-bp deletion (red boxes); the 1-bp deletion causes a frameshift, evidenced by the lack of protein expression downstream from it (spectral count below the virtual genome; scaled from 0 to 800) and by transcriptomic data (reads mapped to the reference genome all support the insertion; lower panel). In contrast, the protein encoded by MQB277_12040 in the assembly is expressed over almost its entire length (class 1a peptides; one peptide identified by seven PSMs spans the frameshift region), also supported by transcriptomic reads mapping without any mismatch (Supplemental Fig. S7 ). (B) Evidence for a SNV causing a nonsynonymous SAAV in the CDS of transcription elongation factor GreA. Four peptides (two, four, eight, 39 PSMs) confirming this SAAV (glycine in reference to glutamic acid in our assembly) are mapped to this position in MQB277.success (80% overall) ranged from 100% for SAAVs and highly expressed novel sORFs to around 55% for novel start sites. Reasons for the lower success with start sites can include N-terminal cleavage or modification, both of which can prevent detection of the single peptide from being confirmed (Goetze et al. 2009 ). Identification of internal start sites is even more difficult but greatly benefits from the availability of dRNA-seq data (Cuklina et al. 2016) and/or N-terminal enrichment steps.Focusing on the description of our novel strategy, we did not further characterize or functionally validate novel sORFs beyond the PRM confirmation. More effort will be required to assess the functional relevance of sORFs, e.g., by individual gene deletion or genome-wide transposon mutagenesis screens (Christen et al. 2011) . Recent work in yeast suggested that sORFs may represent a pool of proto-genes that are under evolutionary pressure and may lead to the birth of novel genes (Carvunis et al. 2012) . Indeed, genes that emerged more recently tend to be shorter (Tautz and Domazet-Loso 2011) .Besides identifying missed sORFs, our data indicated that (1) the procedures to annotate pseudogenes differ between resources (and even releases) and have to be treated with caution, and (2) likely overpredicted ORFs can be uncovered when relying on complete, condition-specific expressed proteomes. Recent advances to comprehensively identify expressed proteomes within a few days (Nagaraj et al. 2012; Richards et al. 2015) suggest that proteomics data can, at least in part, address this issue of overprediction. Such extensive data sets can also uncover functionally relevant genomic changes down to the SAAV level, with implications for clinical proteomics and beyond. For example, by tracking clinically relevant pathogens either over time (Lee et al. 2017) or comparing different strains, genome changes that correlate with higher pathogenicity (de Souza et al. 2011; Nasser et al. 2014; Malmstrom et al. 2015) can be identified, some of which ideally are supported by direct protein expression evidence for SAAVs.Importantly, our data show that assembling the correct genome sequence of the strain under study is of critical importance: It is the optimal basis not only to comprehensively identify expression differences between the conditions studied but also to accurately identify novel sORFs by proteogenomics. An initial de novo assembly should thus be carried out routinely for the most important strains, in particular those that form the basis for long-term projects aiming to integrate functional genomics data.We favor a conservative approach to genome re-annotation, ideally carried out by consortia that iteratively improve the annotation of their respective model or nonmodel organisms (Armengaud et al. 2014 ), e.g., relying on a genome Wiki concept (Fig. 6; Salzberg 2007) . By releasing iPtgxDBs initially for three model organisms (https://iptgxdb.expasy. org; Supplemental File S10) and the software to create them (Supplemental File S11), we hope to enable a large user base to apply proteogenomics in the initial genome annotation step. This will provide an optimal basis for systems-wide functional studies and genome-scale regulatory or metabolic predictions and help to fully capitalize on the genome information and decode its function.", "citance": "Reasons for the lower success with start sites can include N-terminal cleavage or modification, both of which can prevent detection of the single peptide from being confirmed (Goetze et al. 2009 ).", "claims": [{"text": "N-terminal cleavage increases success identifying transcription start sites.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "N-terminal cleavage reduces success identifying transcription start sites.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Recent genomic studies have estimated that \u223c40% of all solid tumors have undergone a genome-doubling event during their evolution, suggesting a significant role for tetraploidy in driving the development of human cancers. To safeguard against the deleterious effects of tetraploidy, nontransformed cells that fail mitosis and become tetraploid activate both the Hippo and p53 tumor suppressor pathways to restrain further proliferation. Tetraploid cells must therefore overcome these antiproliferative barriers to ultimately drive tumor development. However, the genetic routes through which spontaneously arising tetraploid cells adapt to regain proliferative capacity remain poorly characterized. Here, we conducted a comprehensive gain-of-function genome-wide screen to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) that are sufficient to promote the proliferation of tetraploid cells. Our screen identified 23 miRNAs whose overexpression significantly promotes tetraploid proliferation. The vast majority of these miRNAs facilitate tetraploid growth by enhancing mitogenic signaling pathways (e.g., miR-191-3p); however, we also identified several miRNAs that impair the p53/p21 pathway (e.g., miR-523-3p), and a single miRNA (miR-24-3p) that potently inactivates the Hippo pathway via down-regulation of the tumor suppressor gene NF2. Collectively, our data reveal several avenues through which tetraploid cells may regain the proliferative capacity necessary to drive tumorigenesis.", "citation_paragraph": "We aimed to identify potential targets of miR-24-3p to elucidate how it impairs the Hippo pathway to activate YAP. First, we assessed the effect of miR-24-3p overexpression on the levels of the best-characterized Hippo pathway components (e.g., LATS1, LATS2, MST1, MST2; Supplemental Figure S3D ). However, none of the core Hippo kinases was down-regulated, due to miR-24-3p overexpression. We then focused our attention on gene expression data, where we found that an upstream activator of the Hippo pathway, the tumor suppressor gene Neurofibromin 2 (NF2), was one of the 50 most down-regulated genes upon miR-24-3p overexpression (Supplemental Figure S3E ). Known as Merlin in Drosophila, NF2 promotes activation of the LATS1/2 kinases, resulting in the phosphorylation and subsequent cytoplasmic sequestration of YAP (Mohseni et al., 2014) . Loss of NF2 reduces Hippo pathway activity and promotes active, nuclear YAP (Yin et al., 2013; Moroishi et al., 2015b; Meng et al., 2016) . This led us to test whether miR-24-3p overexpression activates YAP through down-regulation of NF2. Consistent with our expression data, we found that miR-24-3p overexpression results in a greater than 50% decrease in NF2 protein levels (Figure 4, A and B) . To compare relative YAP activation between miR-24-3p overexpression and depletion of NF2, we performed immunofluorescence imaging of YAP localization following treatment with siRNAs targeting NF2. Indeed, RNAi knockdown of NF2 significantly increases nuclear YAP localization; however, the observed effect does not recapitulate the magnitude of increased nuclear YAP localization achieved by miR-24-3p (Figure 4, C and D) . These data suggest that miR-24-3p likely targets multiple mRNAs to inactivate the Hippo pathway and promote YAP activity.Previous work has identified multiple roles for miR-24-3p in carcinogenesis. miR-24 is overexpressed in many cancer subtypes (e.g., breast, hepatic, and Hodgkin lymphoma), and its up-regulation screened in triplicate and was internally controlled with multiple p53 siRNA-positive controls and scrambled miRNA negative controls. Day 4: All transfected wells were fed with fresh medium containing penicillin/streptomycin. Day 6: Monastrol (100 \u03bcM) was added to each well for 12 h to arrest proliferating GFP + cells in mitosis. Day 7: At 96 h following transfection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Fluorescence images from each well were acquired using a Nikon TE2000-E2 inverted microscope equipped with a cooled CCD camera (Orca ER, Hamamatsu), and Nikon Perfect Focus. An encoded precision stage was used to capture nine fields of view from each well of the 96-well dish. Subsequently, the total number of proliferating S/G 2 /M cells (based on the GFP positiveness of the FUCCI system) was calculated as a fraction of the total number of cells (based on nuclear counts using Hoechst) for each well. The Zscore was calculated using the formula Z X Neg.Ctl mean Neg.Ctl std.dev = \u2212 . All miRNAs that had a median Z-score of 6.0 were retested in a secondary screen under the same protocol. For the secondary screen, all miRNAs that had a median Z-score above 3.0 were manually examined, and any miRNAs that caused cell death or yellow binucleates (indicative of a failure of the FUCCI degradation system) were removed. The Z-scores from the two screens were then averaged for each miRNA, resulting in the list of hits.", "citance": "Known as Merlin in Drosophila, NF2 promotes activation of the LATS1/2 kinases, resulting in the phosphorylation and subsequent cytoplasmic sequestration of YAP (Mohseni et al., 2014) .", "claims": [{"text": "NF2 (Merlin) causes phosphorylation and subsequent cytoplasmic sequestration of YAP in Drosophila by activating LATS1/2 kinases.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "NF2 (Merlin) prevents phosphorylation and subsequent cytoplasmic sequestration of YAP in Drosophila.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}

Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous population of immature myeloid cells that are recruited by cancer cells, accumulate locally and systemically in advanced cancer, and can abrogate anti-tumor immunity. Prior studies have implicated the phagocyte NADPH oxidase as being an important component promoting MDSC accumulation and immunosuppression in cancer. We therefore used engineered NADPH oxidase-deficient (p47 (phox-/-)) mice to delineate the role of this enzyme complex in MDSC accumulation and function in a syngeneic mouse model of epithelial ovarian cancer. We found that the presence of NADPH oxidase did not affect tumor progression. The accumulation of MDSCs locally and systemically was similar in tumor-bearing wild-type (WT) and p47 (phox-/-) mice. Although MDSCs from tumor-bearing WT mice had functional NADPH oxidase, the suppressive effect of MDSCs on ex vivo stimulated T cell proliferation was NADPH oxidase-independent. In contrast to other tumor-bearing mouse models, our results show that MDSC accumulation and immunosuppression in syngeneic epithelial ovarian cancer is NADPH oxidase-independent. We speculate that factors inherent to the tumor, tumor microenvironment, or both determine the specific requirement for NADPH oxidase in MDSC accumulation and function.", "citation_paragraph": "Using genetically engineered NADPH oxidase-deficient mice, we found that NADPH oxidase did not affect tumor progression in murine EOC. The accumulation of MDSCs locally and systemically was similar in tumor-bearing WT and p47 phox2/2 mice. Although MDSCs from tumor-bearing WT mice had functional NADPH oxidase, the suppressive effect of MDSCs on ex vivo anti-CD3/B7.1-stimulated T cell proliferation was NADPH oxidase-independent. Together, our results show that MDSC accumulation and immunosuppression in murine EOC is NADPH oxidase-independent. We speculate that factors inherent to the tumor, tumor microenvironment, or both determine the specific requirement for NADPH oxidase in MDSC accumulation and function. Since modulation of redox status is a potential therapeutic approach to limit or overcome MDSC-mediated immunosuppression in cancer, it is important to understand NADPH oxidant-dependent and -independent pathways that promote MDSC development.Oxidative stress by activated monocytes, neutrophils, and MDSCs is considered to be one of the components of the chronic inflammatory environment that suppress T cell function. Consistent with this notion, CD8+ cells transduced with catalase (which depletes hydrogen peroxide) had enhanced viability and CTL function [39] . Prior studies have shown that ROI generation is one of the main characteristics of MDSCs from tumor-bearing mice [4, [40] [41] [42] . Additional studies point to a direct role for the phagocyte NADPH oxidase in promoting MDSC accumulation and function [22, 23] . Corzo et al. [23] showed that splenic MDSCs from mice administered subcutaneous tumors had high levels of ROI generation and increased expression of NOX2 subunits, predominantly in gp91 phox and p47 phox compared with immature myeloid cells from na\u00efve mice. In tumor-bearing mice, gp91phox was required for MDSC-mediated suppression of ex-vivo antigen-stimulated T cell proliferation and IFN-c production [23] . These findings differ from our findings in murine EOC in which MDSC accumulation and function were NADPH oxidaseindependent. Thus, rather than NADPH oxidase being uniformly required for MDSC accumulation and function, these findings point to factors inherent to the tumor and/or inflammatory microenvironment determining whether NADPH oxidase is required or dispensable.There are several potential differences in experimental design that might account for NOX2-dependent and -independent MDSC accumulation and function. One possibility relates to the use of p47 phox2/2 mice in our studies versus gp91 phox2/2 mice used by others [22, 23] . Both p47 phox and gp91 phox are required components of NOX2 in both humans and in mice. Deficiency of either component leads to chronic granulomatous disease in humans [21] and to a consistent phenotype in engineered mice characterized by impaired host defense and excessive inflammatory responses to certain microbial products [28, 31, 35, 43, 44] . We found that p47 phox2/2 MDSCs, although completely deficient in stimulated NOX2 activity, had T cell suppressive properties similar to WT MDSCs. Still, we acknowledge the potential for these phox constituents to have NOX2-independent signaling that could affect MDSC accumulation and function. In tumor-bearing mice, MDSCs secrete and are induced by the myeloid-associated S100 proteins phox2/2 mice at day 42 equally suppress both CD4 + and CD8 + T cell proliferation. In contrast, CD11b 2 PECs from the same mice incompletely suppressed anti-CD3/B7.1-stimulated T cell proliferation. C) CD11b-enriched PECs from MOSEC-bearing WT and p47 phox2/2 mice at day 90 completely suppressed T cell proliferation while the CD11b-negative fraction had no significant effect on T cell proliferation. Myeloid PECs collected on day 42 were pooled because of limited cell number, while nonpooled PECs from individual mice were analyzed from day 90 harvests. Individual experiments were performed using PECs from 3 mice per genotype per time point, and each experiment was repeated at least once using PECs from different mice, with similar results. Comparison between genotypes: p = NS. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0069631.g006 [7, 22, 45] , which can prime NOX2 activity. Cheng et al. [22] reported that S100A9 expressed by hematopoietic progenitor cells inhibited their differentiation to DCs and macrophages and induced generation of MDSCs via a gp91 phox -dependent pathway. The lack of effect of NOX2 in MDSC accumulation in our studies indicates that, at least in the MOSEC model, MDSC generation in vivo is NOX2-independent. Other factors that could influence the requirement for NOX2 in MDSC differentiation relate to differences in tumor-derived products (e.g., secreted growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, and angiogenic products) and the local tumor microenvironment (e.g. peritoneal fluid versus subcutaneous). We believe that a strength of our approach is that we focused on MDSCs in the ascites of MOSEC-bearing mice -which are likely to be the most relevant in modulating anti-tumor immunity in the local tumor microenvironment.Both tumor-derived factors and products produced by non-tumor cells in the microenvironment, including G-CSF, GM-CSF, cytokines (e.g., IL-1b, IL-4, IL-6, interferon-c), S100A8/A9, cyclooxygenase-2 and prostaglandin E2, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, and ROIs can promote MDSC development and/or immunosuppressive activity [22, 24, [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] . Because MDSCs can be induced by multiple factors, it is possible that no single molecule is essential for generating MDSCs [1] . In addition, the lack of effect of NOX2 on MDSC accumulation and function does not rule out an effect of other sources of ROIs. There are NOX2-independent sources of ROI generation, including xanthine oxidase [50] and mitochondrial ROIs [51] that have antimicrobial host defense capacity and, conceivably, could contribute to MDSC generation and/or function in the absence of NOX2. These NOX2-independent pathways could potentially react with nitrogen intermediates to generate peroxynitrite, which is required for nitration of TCR/CD8 and induction of T cell tolerance [4] . As a precedent for this concept, the interaction of xanthine oxidase and reactive nitrogen intermediates overcame the requirement for NOX2 as a mediator of ROImediated acute lung injury [52] . We speculate that NOX2 and other ROI-generating enzymes represent alternative pathways for ROI generation that can prime the development of MDSCs. Further work using small molecule inhibitors and genetically engineered mice with deficiencies in specific ROI-generating pathways will be required to test this concept.

The secreted neurotrophic factor Neuregulin-1 (NRG1) and its receptor ErbB4 are established regulators of inhibitory neuron connectivity, but the developmental signalling mechanisms regulating this process remain poorly understood. Here, we provide evidence that NRG1-ErbB4 signalling functions through the multifunctional scaffold protein, Disrupted in Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1), to regulate the development of cortical inhibitory interneuron dendrite and synaptic growth. We found that NRG1 increases inhibitory neuron dendrite complexity and glutamatergic synapse formation onto inhibitory neurons and that this effect is blocked by expression of a dominant negative DISC1 mutant, or DISC1 knockdown. We also discovered that NRG1 treatment increases DISC1 expression and its localization to glutamatergic synapses being made onto cortical inhibitory neurons. Mechanistically, we determined that DISC1 binds ErbB4 within cortical inhibitory neurons. Collectively, these data suggest that a NRG1-ErbB4-DISC1 signalling pathway regulates the development of cortical inhibitory neuron dendrite and synaptic growth. Given that NRG1, ErbB4, and DISC1 are schizophrenia-linked genes, these findings shed light on how independent risk factors may signal in a common developmental pathway that contributes to neural connectivity defects and disease pathogenesis.", "citation_paragraph": "Proper functioning of the central nervous system requires a fine balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission [1] . Cortical inhibitory neurons, classified by their expression of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), comprise 10-25% of neurons in the cortex and are the primary source of inhibition [2] . Cortical inhibitory neurons play major roles in neural development and are important for processes such as fine-tuning of glutamatergic synapse formation and function and defining the timing of critical periods of experience-dependent neural plasticity in the developing brain [3, 4] . Cortical inhibitory neurons are also regulators of high frequency gamma oscillations, which are thought to underlie cognitive processes such as working memory and attention [5] [6] [7] . There is also abundant evidence that deficits in the development and function of cortical inhibitory neurons are involved in neurodevelopmental disorders such as epilepsy, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) [1, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Therefore, understanding the molecular pathways that regulate inhibitory neuron development may shed light on how their function is disrupted in these disorders. In this regard, the morphological development of cortical inhibitory neurons is governed by both extracellular (e.g., neuronal activity [14] and NRG1 [15] [16] [17] ) and intracellular signalling molecules (e.g., the distal-less homeobox (Dlx) family of transcription factors [18] ), which regulate the branching of dendrites and formation of synapses. However, the underlying signalling pathways governing inhibitory neuron development and, consequently, how these processes may be affected in neurodevelopmental disorders are still poorly understood.Multiple studies have implicated a crucial role for the Neuregulin-1-(NRG1-) ErBb4 signalling pathway in the 2 Neural Plasticity development of cortical inhibitory neurons. Furthermore, several linkage and genetic association studies have identified the genes encoding both of these proteins as risk factors for schizophrenia [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . NRG1 is a neurotrophic factor that binds to and activates the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases on target neurons [24, 25] . In the mouse cortex, ErbB4 is predominantly expressed in GABA-ergic inhibitory neurons, with lower expression levels in excitatory neurons [17, [26] [27] [28] . Biological functions of the NRG1-ErbB4 signalling pathway in inhibitory neuron development include processes such as neuronal migration, dendrite growth, synapse formation, and neurotransmitter receptor expression [15, 16, [29] [30] [31] . For example, application of NRG1 to cortical neuronal cultures results in increased dendrite growth and excitatory synaptogenesis onto inhibitory neurons [15, 16] , and inhibitory neuron-specific ErbB4 knockout mice display decreased excitatory synaptogenesis onto cortical inhibitory neurons [30] . One of the mechanisms by which NRG1-ErbB4 signalling regulates these processes is through activation of Kalirin-7, a gene previously implicated in schizophrenia [15, 32, 33] . However, there is little known about other signalling molecules downstream of NRG1-ErbB4 in this context. Disrupted in Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) is another putative schizophrenia risk gene [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] , and many lines of evidence suggest that it may functionally and/or physically interact with the NRG1-ErbB4 signalling pathway [15, 17, 30, [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] . DISC1 was first identified as a balanced translocation between chromosomes 1 and 11 (1q42.1; 11q14.8) in a Scottish pedigree with a high prevalence of schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders [32, 33] . The functional consequence of this translocation is unknown. Previous studies suggest that it may work as a dominant negative protein [48] [49] [50] , while another study suggests the disease mechanism may be haploinsufficiency [51] with the possibility of novel transcripts being generated due to the translocation [52] . The DISC1 gene encodes a scaffold protein that is expressed in the developing and adult brain and shares many roles in neurodevelopment with the NRG1-ErbB4 pathway [15, 46, 48, 50, 53, 54] . Conditional inhibitory neuron-specific ErbB4 knockout mice and DISC1 genetic mouse models display similar morphological deficits in brain development as well as behavioural phenotypes such as abnormal sensorimotor gating, working memory, and sociability [17, 30, [40] [41] [42] [43] 50] . Additionally, ErbB4 and DISC1 share common binding partners at the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses (e.g., postsynaptic density-95 (PSD95) and Kalirin-7) suggesting that they may physically or functionally interact [15, 44, 45] . A study by Seshadri and colleagues demonstrated that treatment of primary mouse cortical neurons with NRG1 increased DISC1 expression in the neurites of cortical neurons [49] . However, this effect was primarily mediated by ErbB2/3, suggesting that a novel NRG1-ErbB2/3 pathway regulates DISC1 expression in cortical excitatory neurons [49] . More recently, a study by the Sawa laboratory demonstrated that, in the mature mouse cortex, there is a functional relationship between NRG1, ErbB4, and DISC1 in the regulation of synaptic plasticity in inhibitory neurons [55] . However, whether this relationship is established during inhibitory neuron development and how the Scottish DISC1 mutation impacts this process have not been experimentally interrogated.Here, we show that NRG1 functions through DISC1 to regulate the development of dendrite growth and excitatory synapse formation onto inhibitory neurons using inhibitory neuron-specific expression of a dominant negative DISC1 mutant that models the Scottish mutation. Furthermore, we provide evidence that treatment of primary mouse cortical cultures with NRG1 increases DISC1 levels and localization to glutamatergic synapses in the primary dendrites of inhibitory neurons. Finally, we provide evidence that ErbB4 binds to DISC1, suggesting that, in developing inhibitory neurons, NRG1-ErbB4 signals through DISC1. Together these results show that two candidate schizophrenia risk pathways functionally interact to regulate the development of cortical inhibitory neuron morphology.", "citance": "More recently, a study by the Sawa laboratory demonstrated that, in the mature mouse cortex, there is a functional relationship between NRG1, ErbB4, and DISC1 in the regulation of synaptic plasticity in inhibitory neurons [55] .", "claims": [{"text": "NRG1, ErbB4, and DISC1 function together to regulate the synaptic plasticity in inhibitory neurons in the mature mouse cortex.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 14918478, "title": "Macropinocytosis Exploitation by Cancers and Cancer Therapeutics", "abstract": "Macropinocytosis has long been known as a primary method for cellular intake of fluid-phase and membrane-bound bulk cargo. This review seeks to re-examine the latest studies to emphasize how cancers exploit macropinocytosis to further their tumorigenesis, including details in how macropinocytosis can be adapted to serve diverse functions. Furthermore, this review will also cover the latest endeavors in targeting macropinocytosis as an avenue for novel therapeutics.", "citation_paragraph": "As cancer cells frequently employ macropinocytosis to aid in receptor regulation and internalize essential metabolites, extensive efforts have been underway in utilizing macropinocytosis to deliver cytotoxic therapeutics specifically into cancer cells. Some anti-cancer agents innately undergo macropinocytosis, such as AS1411, which internalizes into various cancer cells through cell-surface nucleolin-dependent mechanisms that activate macropinocytosis only in malignant cells (Reyes-Reyes et al., 2010) . Other therapeutics specifically target cell surface receptors that may trigger macropinocytosis. For example, therapeutic drugs conjugated with peptides that target a combination of proteoglycans and keratinocyte growth factor receptors (KGFR) can selectively internalize into and kill KGFR-expressing lung cancer cells via macropinocytosis (Iglesias and Koria, 2015) .Potent cancer therapeutics that exhibit excessive, systemic toxicities or unstable pharmacokinetics from hydrophobic profiles are excellent candidates for conjugation to yield chemical conjugates or nanoparticles. The resultant conjugates or nanoparticles can be engineered to yield greater specificity and enhanced pharmacokinetics. In many other examples, synthetic conjugates comprising any combination of small chemicals, lipids, proteins, genetic components, and chemical scaffolds can be developed to form nanoparticles that can then be internalized into target cells via macropinocytosis. Nanoparticles, which vary widely in composition, size, chemical charge, and shape, all contribute to distinct, cellular specificities and in endocytic mechanisms (Kettler et al., 2014) . Larger nanoparticles rely on macropinocytosis for efficient internalization but smaller nanoparticles can traffic into cells through proteincoated endocytosis as well. For example, nanoparticles featuring paclitaxel fused to a chimeric peptide comprising an elastinlike peptide with a hydrophilic peptide (CP-PTX) serve double purposes in reducing the hydrophobic profile of paclitaxel and in enhancing tumorigenic internalization of paclitaxel via macropinocytosis (Bhattacharyya et al., 2015; Iglesias and Koria, 2015) . Nanoparticles can also deliver genetic materials. For example, polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based nanoparticles were successfully used to deliver genes into cancer cells through macropinocytosis (Walsh et al., 2006) . Nanoparticle shapes play important roles as well, as rod-like nanoparticles internalize into cells independently from macropinocytosis (Liu et al., 2016) . Nanoparticles can also be targeted against specific cell types by incorporating aptamers into lipid nanoparticles (Liang et al., 2015) . Similarly, nanoparticles conjugated with antibodies targeting the collagen receptor, \u03b12\u03b21 integrin, lead to efficient internalization via macropinocytosis (Kankaanp\u00e4\u00e4 et al., 2015) . As \u03b12\u03b21 integrins have been previously implicated in both cancer stem cells and tumor angiogenesis, \u03b12\u03b21 integrin-targeting nanoparticles could yield specific utility in cancer therapeutics (Naci et al., 2015) .Another intriguing therapeutic front includes conjugating cytotoxic payloads onto albumin primarily for enhancing drug pharmacokinetics and because albumin has long been observed to accumulate within solid tumors through macropinocytosis (Kratz, 2008 ). An example includes the FDA-approved, nanoparticle albumin-bound form of paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel or Abraxane R ) for treating multiple cancers. However, cancers are still able to overcome these drugs through acquired resistance, likely in differentially expressed proteins that regulate macropinocytosis, including cytoskeletal and lipid metabolism proteins (Zhao et al., 2015b) or through increased drug exporters such as P-glycoprotein (Zhao et al., 2015a) . Other albumin-based conjugates targeting folate receptors also demonstrated efficient delivery of cytotoxic compounds specifically into cancer cells (Shi et al., 2014) . Conjugates with non-albumin carriers have also been successful, including paclitaxel poliglumex (PPX or formerly Xyotax), comprising paclitaxel and polyglutamic acid polymers. PPX has been effective against metastatic breast cancers when used in combination with capecitabine (Northfelt et al., 2014) .Another component commonly used for conjugation is the poly-arginine peptide. As poly-arginine peptides induce macropinocytosis and cancer cells generally have increased macropinocytosis, efforts have been underway in conjugating poly-arginine peptides with cytotoxic compounds. These conjugates can be employed to deliver a variety of materials into cells, including cytotoxic reagents against cancer cells (Biswas et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2014) , genetic materials (Zhang et al., 2006; Hayashi et al., 2012) , insulin (Liu et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2015) , and liposomes across the blood brain barrier (Qin et al., 2012) . Interestingly, at least in HeLa cancer cells, polyarginine peptide entry into the cell cytosol occurs independently from macropinocytosis (Zaro et al., 2006) . This suggests that poly-arginine peptides endocytosis may not be exclusive to macropinocytosis, depending on both the cargo and cell type.As cancers routinely internalize exosomes, a logical maneuver includes formulating therapeutics that mimic exosomes. Exosomes can be derived from same-host cells to avoid inducing immune responses (Hall et al., 2016) . Alternatively, exosomes originating from dendritic cells may help elicit immune responses by T and NK cells to specifically target cancer cells (Pitt et al., 2016) . Exosomes can be prepared in vitro, with therapeutic proteins either electroporated into exosomes or intracellularly incorporated through targeted overexpression of genes in the cell cultures (Munson and Shukla, 2015) . Furthermore, lipid-membrane coat-based delivery systems that resemble exosomes can be engineered in ways that promote endosomal escape after macropinocytic entry into cells to enable gene delivery into cells while avoiding degradation through the lysosomal pathway (Khalil et al., 2007) . Exosomes are extremely useful in delivering payloads into cancer cells without requiring advanced chemical conjugation as often required in nanoparticles. Additionally, exosomes also offer greater flexibility in packaging diverse combinations of cargoes.", "citance": "Nanoparticles can also be targeted against specific cell types by incorporating aptamers into lipid nanoparticles (Liang et al., 2015) .", "claims": [{"text": "Nanoparticles can be targeted against specific cell types by incorporating aptamers into lipid nanoparticles.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Chronic infection of gastric epithelial cells by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a major risk factor for human gastric cancer (GC) where Cav1 is frequently down-regulated. However, the function of Cav1 in H. pylori infection and pathogenesis of GC remained unknown. We show here that Cav1-deficient mice, infected for 11 months with the CagA-delivery deficient H. pylori strain SS1, developed more severe gastritis and tissue damage, including loss of parietal cells and foveolar hyperplasia, and displayed lower colonisation of the gastric mucosa than wild-type B6129 littermates. Cav1-null mice showed enhanced infiltration of macrophages and B-cells and secretion of chemokines (RANTES) but had reduced levels of CD25+ regulatory T-cells. Cav1-deficient human GC cells (AGS), infected with the CagA-delivery proficient H. pylori strain G27, were more sensitive to CagA-related cytoskeletal stress morphologies (\"humming bird\") compared to AGS cells stably transfected with Cav1 (AGS/Cav1). Infection of AGS/Cav1 cells triggered the recruitment of p120 RhoGTPase-activating protein/deleted in liver cancer-1 (p120RhoGAP/DLC1) to Cav1 and counteracted CagA-induced cytoskeletal rearrangements. In human GC cell lines (MKN45, N87) and mouse stomach tissue, H. pylori down-regulated endogenous expression of Cav1 independently of CagA. Mechanistically, H. pylori activated sterol-responsive element-binding protein-1 (SREBP1) to repress transcription of the human Cav1 gene from sterol-responsive elements (SREs) in the proximal Cav1 promoter. These data suggested a protective role of Cav1 against H. pylori-induced inflammation and tissue damage. We propose that H. pylori exploits down-regulation of Cav1 to subvert the host's immune response and to promote signalling of its virulence factors in host cells.", "citation_paragraph": "Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a Gram-negative bacterium which colonizes stomachs of approx. 50% of the world's population and increases the risk for development of chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, mucosal atrophy and gastric cancer (GC) [1, 2] . Based on this etiology, H. pylori has been classified as a class I carcinogen by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 1994 [3] .The two major H. pylori toxins [4] , CagA and VacA, are internalized into gastric epithelial cells by injection via the bacterial type IV secretion system (CagA) [5] or by direct insertion into lipid rafts (VacA) [6, 7] . Lipid rafts are cholesterol and sphingolipid-rich microdomains of the plasma membrane [8, 9] which are exploited by many pathogens, including viruses, parasites and bacteria, to facilitate uptake of whole organisms and/or internalisation of toxins into host cells [10, 11, 12] . For example, Neisseria spec. uses lipid rafts and Rho-mediated signaling of the actin cytoskeleton to gain access to the cytosol [13] . Pseudomonas aeruginosa exploits lipid raft-associated toll-like receptor 2 for infection of lung epithelial cells [14] .Caveolin-1 (Cav1) is the 21-24 kDa major and essential structural protein of caveolae, a specialized form of lipid raft microdomains. Caveolae are 50-100 nm flask/tube-shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane abundant in macrophages, endothelial and smooth muscle cells, type I pneumocytes and adipocytes, where they participate in cellular transport processes including endocytosis, cholesterol efflux and membrane traffic [15, 16] . In this context, Cav1 can also act as an inhibitor of clathrin-independent endocytosis and block pathogen/toxin uptake [17, 18] . Through binding to its scaffolding domain, Cav1 directly inhibits a plethora of receptors and enzymes including tyrosine kinases of the Src and Ras family, G-proteins and nitric oxide synthases [15] . In addition to a role in membrane traffic, Cav1 thus constitutes a control platform for regulation of cell proliferation and survival [19] . Cav1 also exerts an important function in cell motility and migration and, within epithelial, stromal and endothelial tissues, by enforcing cell-cell contacts, cellmatrix adhesion and immune responses [20, 21, 22, 23] .Cav1 directly binds cholesterol, and transcription of Cav1 is negatively regulated by the transcription factor sterol-responsive element-binding protein-1 (SREBP1) [24] . SREBP1 is bound to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as an inactive 125 kDa precursor and is activated under conditions of cholesterol deficiency by proteolytic cleavage in the Golgi apparatus. This cleavage is followed by translocation of the active 68 kDa SREBP1 into the nucleus where it binds to sterol-responsive elements (SREs) of target genes, including Cav1, involved in synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids [25] . H. pylori has been shown to metabolize cholesterol from the host cell membrane, and host cholesterol alters the oncogenic properties of CagA [26, 27] .We therefore hypothesized that the cholesterol-binding proteins SREBP1 and Cav1 are targets of H. pylori infection and/or effector functions. Specifically, we asked whether (i) H. pylori exploits Cav1 to facilitate injection and down-stream signalling of CagA in gastric epithelial cells or (ii) Cav1 acts as a protective ''barrierenforcing'' protein that counteracts disease evoked by H. pylori. To test this, the phenotypes which result from H. pylori infection were studied in Cav1-deficient mice and in human GC cell lines. Our data showed that Cav1 protected B6129 mice against H. pylorirelated gastritis and tissue damage in vivo independently of CagA. H. pylori also activated SREBP1 and down-regulated expression of murine and human Cav1 independently of CagA. In addition, Cav1 counteracted CagA-dependent cytoskeletal rearrangements in vitro by recruitment of the tumor suppressor deleted in liver cancer-1 (DLC1).", "citance": "For example, Neisseria spec. uses lipid rafts and Rho-mediated signaling of the actin cytoskeleton to gain access to the cytosol [13] .", "claims": [{"text": "Neisseria species uses lipid rafts and Rho-mediated signaling of the actin cytoskeleton to gain access to the cytosol.

{"s2orc_id": 10456909, "title": "Prophylactic inhibition of neutrophil elastase prevents the development of chronic neuropathic pain in osteoarthritic mice", "abstract": "BACKGROUND A subset of osteoarthritis (OA) patients experience joint pain with neuropathic characteristics. Mediators such as neutrophil elastase, a serine proteinase, may be released during acute OA inflammatory flares. We have previously shown that local administration of neutrophil elastase causes joint inflammation and pain via activation of proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR2). The aim of this study was to examine the contribution of endogenous neutrophil elastase and PAR2 to the development of joint inflammation, pain, and neuropathy associated with monoiodoacetate (MIA)-induced experimental OA.   METHODS MIA (0.3 mg/10 \u03bcl) was injected into the right knee joint of male C57BL/6 mice (20-34 g). Joint inflammation (edema, leukocyte kinetics), neutrophil elastase proteolytic activity, tactile allodynia, and saphenous nerve demyelination were assessed over 14 days post-injection. The effects of inhibiting neutrophil elastase during the early inflammatory phase of MIA (days 0 to 3) were determined using sivelestat (50 mg/kg i.p.) and serpinA1 (10 \u03bcg i.p.). Involvement of PAR2 in the development of MIA-induced joint inflammation and pain was studied using the PAR2 antagonist GB83 (5 \u03bcg i.p. days 0 to 1) and PAR2 knockout animals.   RESULTS MIA caused an increase in neutrophil elastase proteolytic activity on day 1 (P < 0.0001), but not on day 14. MIA also generated a transient inflammatory response which peaked on day 1 (P < 0.01) then subsided over the 2-week time course. Joint pain appeared on day 1 and persisted to day 14 (P < 0.0001). By day 14, the saphenous nerve showed signs of demyelination. Early treatment with sivelestat and serpinA1 blocked the proteolytic activity of neutrophil elastase on day 1 (P < 0.001), and caused lasting improvements in joint inflammation, pain, and saphenous nerve damage (P < 0.05). MIA-induced synovitis was reversed by early treatment with GB83 and attenuated in PAR2 knockout mice (P < 0.05). PAR2 knockout mice also showed reduced MIA-induced joint pain (P < 0.0001) and less nerve demyelination (P = 0.81 compared to saline control).   CONCLUSIONS Neutrophil elastase and PAR2 contribute significantly to the development of joint inflammation, pain, and peripheral neuropathy associated with experimental OA, suggesting their potential as therapeutic targets.", "citation_paragraph": "The results presented here demonstrate a transient inflammatory response in the early stages of the MIA model of OA which is, in part, mediated by neutrophil elastase. Imaging studies clearly show that neutrophil elastase is proteolytically active in MIA-treated knee joints on day 1 which abates by day 14. Systemic treatment with the neutrophil elastase inhibitor sivelestat or serpinA1 significantly reduced the proteolytic activity of neutrophil elastase on day 1 post-MIA injection, confirming that these drugs can inhibit the MIAinduced increase in neutrophil elastase.Synovitis is known to occur in a subgroup of OA patients which is short-lasting, intermittent, and associated with episodes of intense pain. In this study, injection of MIA caused acute pro-inflammatory changes within the knee joint, as evidenced by an increase in knee joint diameter and leukocyte trafficking. The inflammation peaked on day 1, decreased by day 3, and remained at a low level for the remainder of the study period. These findings are consistent with previous studies where MIA produced significant edema and pain when compared to intra-articular saline [35, 36] . Guzman et al. [46] showed that the edematous fluid procured from day 1 MIA joints contained fibrin, protein, and infiltrated inflammatory cells; this inflammatory exudate subsided by day 7 after MIA injection. Various cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6) and adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, P-selectin) are involved in the extravasation of leukocytes at the site of inflammation [47] . These leukocytes release neutrophil elastase which can cleave important adhesion molecules and activate pro-inflammatory cytokines, thereby contributing to further leukocyte adhesion and extravasation [48] [49] [50] [51] .Sivelestat and serpinA1 can directly inhibit the enzymatic activity of neutrophil elastase, and can reduce inflammation [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] . In the present study, sivelestat and serpinA1 inhibited the activity of neutrophil elastase during the early, acute inflammatory phase of the MIA model. These agents decreased joint edema and reduced the number of rolling and adherent leukocytes following treatment, suggesting that neutrophil elastase is present and contributes to leukocyte extravasation in the early inflammatory phase of MIA-induced OA. . MIA injection produced a significant decrease in tolerance to tactile stimulation throughout the 14-day time course which was inhibited by early treatment with sivelestat (P < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA) and serpinA1 (P < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA) (n = 8-9 per time point). ****P < 0.0001 as compared with baseline, one-way ANOVA Injection of MIA leads to an immediate and lasting pain response in ipsilateral hindlimbs. Acute, early treatment with sivelestat or serpinA1 not only blocked this mechanical hypersensitivity during the treatment phase but prevented development of a chronic pain response at later time points. These results suggest that early inhibition of neutrophil elastase to block acute inflammation can inhibit the later development of pain in this model of OA. Additionally, a recent investigation by Vicuna et al. [59] confirmed that neutrophil elastase, secreted by infiltrating T cells within the dorsal root ganglia, contributes to the development of neuropathic pain after nerve injury. There is substantial evidence to show that MIA has the capacity to cause nerve injury, as indicated by an upregulation of the nerve injury marker activating transcription factor 3 (ATF-3) [38, [60] [61] [62] . The results described here show that intra-articular MIA causes demyelination of saphenous nerve fibers and suggest that the nerve damage and mechanical pain that develop in the MIA model of OA is, at least in part, related to the early presence of neutrophil elastase. It is possible that the neutrophil elastase inhibitors could also attenuate joint damage associated with OA; however, this was not tested here as the MIA model does not fully recapitulate the degenerative characteristics seen in human OA.Several studies have indicated that neutrophil elastase evokes inflammation and pain via activation of PAR2 [19, 20, 63] . Activation of PAR2 can trigger inflammation in various tissues like the gut, airways, and joints [23, [63] [64] [65] . Indeed, activation of PAR2 leads to several inflammatory changes such as increased cytokine production, joint edema, leukocyte-endothelial interactions, upregulation of intercellular adhesion molecules, and synovial hyperemia [19, 27, 28, 65, 66] . In the experiments described here, the PAR2 antagonist GB83 The increased number of adherent leukocytes on day 1 was reduced by treatment with GB83 (5 \u03bcg i.p., administered 10 min before and 120 and 240 min after MIA, on day 0 and once on day 1 (60 min before assessment)) and absent in PAR2 knockout mice. (n = 8-9 per group) *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, compared to the MIA control, one-way ANOVA. c Lower panel shows representative intravital micrographs in the different cohorts of mice; red arrows indicate stained leukocytes inhibited edema and leukocyte trafficking in MIAinjected knee joints. This pharmacological observation was corroborated in PAR2 knockout mice. Neutrophil elastase-induced inflammation has previously been shown to be blocked by GB83 and absent in PAR2 knockout mice [19] . It follows, therefore, that the local release of endogenous neutrophil elastase likely leads to activation of articular PAR2 to induce knee joint inflammation in MIA-injected mice.MIA-induced secondary allodynia was reduced in the absence of PAR2 suggesting this receptor plays an important role in the development of pain in this model. It is known that PAR2, SP, and CGRP are co-expressed on dorsal root ganglion neurons [67, 68] , suggesting an interplay between PARs and inflammatory neuropeptides. Since MIA can cause the peripheral release of SP and CGRP [12] , it is feasible that the pain associated with PAR2 activation is related to neurogenic inflammation. The data presented here show a reduction in MIAinduced secondary allodynia after inhibition of neutrophil elastase. It is, therefore, likely that endogenous neutrophil elastase is causing proteolytic cleavage of PAR2 to elicit secondary allodynia in MIA-induced arthritis, as neutrophil elastase-induced pain has also been shown to be PAR2-dependent [19] .G-ratio analysis revealed that injection of MIA reduced myelin thickness in the saphenous nerve fibers innervating the knee joints of wild-type mice. Intriguingly, there was no loss of myelin in PAR2 knockout mice, which suggests that this receptor is involved in joint peripheral neuropathy.", "citance": "Additionally, a recent investigation by Vicuna et al.

They are detected in several autoimmune disorders and are particularly associated with systemic vasculitis.   CASE REPORT We report a case of a 54-year-old female presenting with a pruritic rash, including purpura and diffuse erythema. A biopsy with hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) analysis, direct immunofluorescence (DIF), immunohistochemistry (IHC) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for ANCAs were performed. The H & E staining demonstrated leukocytoclastic vasculitis, with focal vascular fibrinoid necrosis. The DIF revealed evidence of vasculitis, the presence of p-ANCAs and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). The IHC displayed autoreactivity to myeloperoxidase within the vessels. The IHC aided in ruling out any intrinsic autofluorescence of the vessels.   CONCLUSIONS By observing the deposition of neutrophil extracellular traps and myeloperoxidase in inflamed skin vessels, biopsy analysis may alert physicians for rapid therapeutic intervention in patients presenting with possible vasculitides.", "citation_paragraph": "Small-vessel vasculitides are autoimmune disorders, often associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCAs) [1] . The c-ANCAs are detected serum testing, as well as by direct and indirect immunofluorescence in a number of autoimmune disorders [1] . ANCAs were originally divided into two primary classes, c-ANCAs and p-ANCAs, based on their pattern of staining in neutrophils. ANCA associated vasculitides classically affect the small vessels, and can present diverse clinical manifestations [1] [2] [3] . The primary clinical treatment of these disorders is systemic corticosteroid therapy, with or without other immunosuppressants.Attempts to explain and model the presence of ANCAs have included the theory of molecular mimicry. For instance, microbial superantigens are molecules expressed by bacteria and other microrganisms that have the power to stimulate a strong immune response by activation of T lymphocytes. These molecules generally have regions that resemble self-antigens; thus, the origin of the theory of molecular mimicry. Staphylococcal and streptococcal superantigens have been characterized in several autoimmune diseases. The classic example of such superantigen pathophysiology is found in group A Streptococcal rheumatic heart disease, where there is similarity between the M proteins of Streptococcus pyogenes and those of cardiac myosin and laminin. It has also been shown that up to 70% of patients with Wegener's granulomatosis are chronic nasal carriers of Staphylococcus aureus, with carriers having an eight times increased risk of disease presentation [3] . In addition, an alternative theory of defective apoptosis has been suggested as a possible explanation of ANCA pathophysiology. Neutrophil apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is critical in controlling the duration of the early inflammatory response, thus reducing injury to normal tissues by the neutrophils. ANCAs may be developed secondary to either 1) ineffective apoptosis or 2) ineffective removal of apoptotic cell fragments, leading to the exposure of the immune system to molecules normally sequestered inside the cells. The apoptosis theory solves the seeming pathophysiologic contradiction of how it could be possible for ANCAs to be raised against intracellular antigenic targets [3] .The role of ANCAs in disease has been linked to three primary diseases that are consistently associated with ANCAs. The most commonly associated disorders are Wegener's granulomatosis, microscopic polyangiitis and glomerulonephritis [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . The antibodies are assumed to be involved in the generation and/or progression of the clinical lesions. Traditionally, c-ANCAs are associated with Wegener's granulomatosis; p-ANCAs are associated with both microscopic polyangiitis and focal necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . However, in recent years, ANCAs targeted against other autoantigens have been identified, including those involved in Churg-Strauss syndrome. Patients with a number of other diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and ankylosing spondylitis, will frequently display ANCAs as well [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . However, in these cases, there is classically no associated vasculitis, and the ANCAs are thought to be incidental or epiphenomena rather than part of the primary disease itself. Churg-Strauss syndrome is associated with p-ANCAs directed against MPO [5] . It is unclear what the role of ANCAs may be Wegener's granulomatosis, glomerulonephritis, and Churg Strauss syndrome; they may be markers of the diseases, or, alternatively, may play some part in the pathogenic process. In Wegener's granulomatosis, there is positive correlation between ANCA titer and disease activity; further, in vitro studies have shown that ANCAs cause activation of primed neutrophils and react with endothelial cells expressing PR3 [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . ANCAs may thus act by causing release of lytic enzymes from the white blood cells, causing vasculitis in the nearby blood vessel walls.In our case, the clinical diagnosis of cutaneous vasculitis is supported by biopsy confirmation. Within the biopsy, microscopic findings of acute vasculitis such as fibrinoid necrosis, chronic signs such as endarteritis obliterans, and distant chronic signs such as acellular scarring were identified. Our findings did not favor the diagnosis of microscopic polyangiitis due to the following: 1) no additional indicators of granulomatous inflammation were present (e.g., evidence of lung cavities or infiltrates present for over one month duration); and 2) no biopsy findings of either a) glomerulonephritis, nor b) involvement of more than one organ system existed (as documented by a biopsy or surrogate marker). The patient was not taking any medications at the time of biopsy. By definition, ANCA related vasculitides are usually \"pauci-immune\", that is, they present few and weak vascular immunoreactants by DIF .However, for more than fifty years, dermatopathologists and immunodermatologists were utilizing only monochromatic FITC DIF, and not multicolor immunofluorescence as we did in our case. Thus, the sensitivity and specificity of our analysis is increased by utilizing these techniques. We also utilized IHC; this technique was employed to rule out nonpathologic, intense autofluorescence of the vessels (i.e., to be able to distinguish between real pathologic reactivity versus intrinsic self fluorescence of the vessels).Our case also displays acute findings, and highlights the difficulty of making a specific diagnosis of vasculitis (especially due to the presence of IgA, IgD, vascular deposits and p-ANCAs). Specifically, we believe our case may represent a brief, largely subclinical presentation of Henoch Schonlein purpura, or, alternatively, an ANCA-positive small vessel vasculitis, i.e., polyarteritis nodosa [10] [11] [12] . Other diseases where the combined, simultaneous findings of vasculitis and ANCAs can be found include Goodpasture's syndrome/anti-GBM-positive renal disease, and eleven per cent of cases of giant-cell arteritis. Other rare, less likely diseases that should be considered include Felty's syndrome, atypical pneumonia, post-Streptococcal glomerulonephritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, mixed connective tissue disease, and Wegener's granulomatosis. Finally, it should be noted that many non-MPO p-ANCAs exist, including 1) those directed at other polycytoplasmic enzymes (elastase, lactoferrin, lactoperoxidase, lysozyme, azurocidin, or cathepsin G), as well as 2) ANAs, and 3) granulocyte-specific ANAs (GS-ANAs) [10] [11] [12] . Based on the clinical, histologic and DIF findings in our case, a complete ANCA panel was ordered for the patient. One of the primary clinical problems encountered when evaluating patients with vasculitis is the fact that patients often present during an acute flare of the disease process.It is thus difficult for us to compare our case to other studies regarding treatment of early small vessel vasculitis. Specifically, we found reports where early treatment of MPO-p-ANCA-associated small vessel vasculitis was felt to be crucial for the patient's positive prognosis (patients were treated with oral corticosteroid and cyclophosphamide therapy, in conjunction with plasmapheresis) [10] [11] [12] . Notably, one of the major problems physicians have to face when treating patients with early or chronic phase vasculitis is that patients may not respond to standard therapy, or may require unacceptably high doses of steroids or immunosuppressants [10] [11] [12] [13] .In our case, prompt medical intervention resulted in the clearance of the clinical as well as normalization of the laboratory findings in our patient. Finally, specific predictors of treatment resistance and relapse of ANCA-associated small-vessel vasculitis have been recently described by utilizing clinical, pathologic and serologic predictors of treatment resistance and relapse in a community-based cohort of patients with ANCA-associated vasculitides [10] [11] [12] [13] . The presence of IgD has been also reported in association with allergic vasculitis [14] . Finally, we were also were able to demonstrate evidence of the p-ANCA antigen(s) in the epidermis. These likely represent chromatin fibers, or so-called neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), released by ANCA-stimulated neutrophils; these antigens may contain the targeted autoantigens PR3 and MPO [15] . We conclude that in these cases, early H&E and multicolor DIF diagnosis and rapid treatment (with systemic corticosteroid therapy, with or without other immunosuppressants) may contribute to both a favorable prognosis, and to a lack of lesional clinical recurrence.", "citance": "These likely represent chromatin fibers, or so-called neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), released by ANCA-stimulated neutrophils; these antigens may contain the targeted autoantigens PR3 and MPO [15] .", "claims": [{"text": "Neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) antigens may contain the targeted autoantigens PR3 and MPO.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are released by ANCA-stimulated neutrophils.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Advances in technology have allowed visualisation of neutrophil trafficking to sites of inflammation, and, remarkably, neutrophils have been observed to depart from the scene in what has been termed reverse migration. There has also been increasing appreciation of the heterogeneity of neutrophils with ongoing categorisation of neutrophil subsets, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells and low-density granulocytes. Newly recognised neutrophil functions include the ability to release novel immune mediators such as extracellular DNA and microvesicles. Finally, studies of neutrophil cell death, both apoptotic and non-apoptotic, have revealed remarkable differences compared to other cell types. This review will highlight important discoveries in these facets of neutrophil biology and how the new findings will inform treatment of diseases where neutrophils are implicated.", "citation_paragraph": "One form of non-apoptotic neutrophil cell death has been termed NETosis or neutrophil extracellular trap release-associated cell death [52] . The central characteris-DOI: 10.1159/000493101 tics of this form of neutrophil demise are caspase-independent cell death and the release of DNA coated in neutrophil granule proteins. The exact mechanisms and clinical relevance of this form of cell death have been the focus of a large amount of research, with many questions remaining [53] . Key questions about NETosis and NET release remain, including whether DNA release can occur without triggering neutrophil death, as has been described in vitro for the release of mitochondrial DNA [54] and in vivo using two-photon microscopy in mice [55] . The physiologic and pathologic stimuli that induce NETosis need to be better defined, as a number of studies describing the mechanistic pathways of NETosis have been performed using the potent non-physiologic cell stimulant PMA [53, 56] .One scenario that appears to trigger this process is the attempted phagocytosis of large pathogens such as fungal hyphae [57] . As a consequence of the size of the hyphae, instead of forming a discrete pathogen-containing phagosome, the neutrophil granule enzymes are released into the cytoplasm in a ROS-dependent manner to enter the nucleus, degrade histones and allow the chromatin to decondense prior to cell membrane compromise. Intriguingly, neutrophils also respond to large particles by producing IL-1\u03b2 [58] . In comparison to the phagocytosis of small particles where intracellularly generated ROS leads to oxidation of NF-\u03baB and inhibition of IL-1\u03b2 generation, ROS are instead directed extracellularly. These two neutrophil responses create a strategy of amplified neutrophil recruitment and local deposition of DNA and neutrophil granule proteins to ensnare the large hyphae and control growth.As discussed above, one important consequence of apoptosis in neutrophils is that it triggers orderly dismantling of the cell and labelling of the cells for phagocytosis by macrophages, such that the potentially toxic neutrophil contents are sequestered during cell death. Furthermore, ingestion of apoptotic neutrophils triggers an antiinflammatory response in the macrophages themselves [59] . Cell death with release of intracellular contents has the potential to circumvent this process. DNA release in the context of neutrophil cell death has been found to prime macrophages to release IL-1\u03b2 in the context of atherosclerotic disease [60] both in vitro and in vivo.The interaction of dead neutrophils with clearing phagocytes may be further perturbed by bacteria. Staphylococcus aureus was found to degrade the extracellular DNA structures released by neutrophils, not only dismantling their net-like properties, but converting the nucleic acids into deoxyadenosine, which resulted in caspasemediated cell death of macrophages in proximity [61] .Another scenario where neutrophil cell death and DNA release may be of physiologic importance is in the human inflammatory joint disease gout. In vitro, monosodium urate (MSU) crystals are phagocytosed by neutrophils and, unlike hyphae, are encased in a maturing phagosome. Neutrophils subsequently undergo rapid cell death with post-mortem decondensation of the chromatin [62] (Fig. 3) . This raises the question whether this form of cell death is programmed or a form of unregulated cell disruption occurring in the context of neutrophil granule release, resulting in dismantling of the chromatin. Extracellular DNA structures associated with neutrophil granule proteins are found to be associated with MSU crystals taken from the joints of gout patients, sug- gesting the process is occurring in this context. Using an in vivo model of MSU peritonitis, release of DNA leads to the formation of large aggregates of crystals that not only sequester the crystals but also actively degrade proinflammatory cytokines, leading to downregulation of inflammation [63] . This is in keeping with the clinical observations that gout attacks are self-limited and large aggregates of MSU crystals form around the joints of gout patients but remain largely uninflamed.", "citance": "Intriguingly, neutrophils also respond to large particles by producing IL-1\u03b2 [58] .", "claims": [{"text": "Neutrophils produce IL-1\u03b2 in response to large particles.", "subject": "Neutrophils ", "is_negation": false}]}

Adults with obesity were recruited from a bariatric surgery specialty clinic in Canada. Patients completed measures of psychological distress (i.e., Beck Depression Inventory II and Beck Anxiety Inventory), eating pathology (i.e., Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire), ESR (i.e., \u201cManaging Own Emotions\u201d subscale of the Schutte Emotional Intelligence Test), and sADHD (i.e., Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale) prior to surgery. Measures of height and weight were obtained and used to calculate percent excess weight loss (%EWL) of body mass index (BMI) pre- and 12 months post-surgery. Thirty-seven patients were recruited. The final sample consisted of 30 patients (80% female; mean age = 48 years; mean BMI = 49.32). Patients experienced significant weight loss and reported significant improvement in anxiety, depressed mood, and eating pathology from pre- to 12 months post-surgery. A significant sADHD by ESR interaction on %EWL (F(1, 21) = 6.43, p = .019) was observed and accounted for 13% of unique variance after adjusting for relevant covariates. Probing the interaction with the Johnson-Neyman technique indicated that there was a significant inverse association between sADHD and %EWL among individuals who scored \u2264 0.15 SD below the mean on ESR. ESR moderated the association between sADHD and %EWL, suggesting that sADHD may attenuate weight loss following bariatric surgery among individuals deficient in ESR. This finding has implications for bariatric surgery pre-surgical psychological assessment.", "citation_paragraph": "This is the first study to examine the combined influence of sADHD and ESR on weight loss 12 months after bariatric surgery. Consistent with the hypothesis, ESR moderated the association between sADHD and %EWL 12 months after adjusting for psychological distress and relevant covariates. Specifically, an inverse association between sADHD and %EWL was only observed among patients who also scored relatively low on ESR. This association was observed among 37% of the sample and included patients who endorsed clinically relevant and subthreshold symptoms of ADHD. These results suggest that sADHD may only interfere with weight loss following bariatric surgery among patients who also have difficulty with ESR. The influence of pre-surgical ADHD and ESR on weight loss after bariatric surgery is unclear. Whereas associations have been reported between cognitive deficits characteristic of ADHD and post-surgery outcomes (14, 16, 17), several studies reported no association between ADHD and weight loss after surgery (18) (19) (20) . No studies have examined the effect of ESR on bariatric surgery outcomes directly. However, there is equivocal evidence on the role of emotional eating (a common manifestation of poor self-regulation) (37, 38, 50) in weight loss after bariatric surgery. For example, one systematic review reported an inverse association between emotional eating and post-surgery weight loss in three of six studies (13) . The sADHD by ESR interaction observed in this study represents one plausible explanation for previous inconsistencies. Specifically, experiencing comorbid sADHD and relatively low ESR may lead to greater weight loss difficulty relative to those who experience one or neither condition. Further, the present results align with theoretical models that consider ADHD with deficient ESR a distinct ADHD subtype characterized by increased impairment (26, 32, 35, 51) . ADHD is currently understood as a heterogeneous disorder with variable symptom presentation (52); ADHD with relatively low ESR may represent one pattern of ADHD symptomatology that is more likely to interfere with weight loss after bariatric surgery. These results have implications for assessment and care of patients with obesity seeking bariatric surgery.Current recommendations for the psychological screening of bariatric surgery candidates include assessment for ADHD and disordered eating (15) . The present results highlight a potential need to assess for concomitant ESR difficulties. Identifying comorbid sADHD and relatively low ESR could be critical for providing targeted interventions to manage the symptoms of these disorders that interfere with weight loss (e.g., low impulse control, emotional eating, and poor planning). Results from nonsurgical obesity interventions for ADHD and ESR are encouraging: pharmacologic treatment has improved sADHD and promoted weight loss in patients with ADHD and obesity (21, 53) , and interventions to teach patients adaptive emotion regulation skills (e.g., reappraisal) have resulted in decreased emotional eating. For example, a recent prospective interventional study reported that an educational intervention improved emotion regulation skills, and these improvements corresponded to greater weight loss at 12-month follow-up (54). Consistent with previous reports (3, 4, 8, 55) , patients experienced significant weight loss and reported improvement on measures of psychological distress and eating pathology from pre-to 12 months post-surgery. Positive change in mood is often attributed to increased self-esteem, improved body image, and the sense of personal control that accompanies excess weight loss (55) . While these results are encouraging, longitudinal studies (i.e., > 2 years) have reported that symptoms of depression and anxiety worsen over time (15, 56, 57) , especially when patients experience unmet expectations surrounding weight or shape change (55) . Similarly, disordered eating may subside following bariatric surgery, only to return in the long term (14, 55). For example, one prospective study examining bariatric surgery outcomes among 80 women reported that maladaptive eating behaviors (i.e., binge eating, night eating syndrome) returned to pre-operative levels in the long term (i.e., 8 years) (56) .Whereas pre-surgical psychological distress (i.e., depression, anxiety, and eating pathology) explained close to onethird of the variance in %EWL 12 months , anxiety alone was associated with weight loss and the direction of the effect was opposite to what would be predicted (i.e., higher anxiety corresponded to greater %EWL at 12 months). This result is not atypical to the literature examining associations between pre-surgical psychological distress and post-surgery weight loss, which has been equivocal (13) (14) (15) 58) . A recent metaanalysis by Dawes et al. (58) , for instance, concluded that preoperative depression and binge eating are inconsistent predictors of weight loss after bariatric surgery. Similarly, recent recommendations for the psychosocial screening of bariatric surgery candidates (15) reported that it is unclear whether BED is a clear contradiction to post-surgery weight loss. Studies on the association between pre-surgical anxiety and post-surgery weight loss have similarly mixed results (15) .The results of this investigation should be interpreted with caution for several reasons. First, the sample consisted of predominately White women with low to moderate psychological distress and eating pathology prior to surgery. Although these characteristics are typical of bariatric surgery-seeking populations (i.e., white, female, age = mid-40s, BMI = 45) (3, 8) , the findings may not generalize to men, ethnic minorities, or those with severe psychopathology seeking bariatric surgery. Second, the results of this manuscript are based on a relatively small sample size (n = 30) and should be interpreted with caution given that small sample designs are more likely to result in type 1 errors and exaggerate the magnitude of effects (59) . Third, the use of self-report measures of sADHD, ESR, and 12-month weight may have biased the results due to social desirability effects. Evidence suggests that patients presenting for bariatric surgery may engage in impression management (60) and self-reported weight will not always closely approximate objective weight (61) . To mitigate these risks, when possible, self-reported weight at 12 months was compared against the patient's most recent weight recorded in their medical chart. In all such reviews, self-reported weight closely approximated the most recent weight entered in the patient's medical chart. Fourth, the primary end-point in our study was Emotion Self-Regulation Fig. 1 The association between symptoms of ADHD and excess weight loss at low, average, and high emotion self-regulation 12 months after bariatric surgery 12 months post-surgery and the pattern of results observed may not extend to longer-term weight loss when the novelty of surgery has dissipated (11) . It is necessary to evaluate these associations at longer post-surgery intervals (e.g., > 3 years) in order to determine whether the combined effects of sADHD and ESR on %EWL persist over time. Finally, the effects of sADHD on weight loss in the present study may have been influenced by the presence of more severe forms of psychopathology (e.g., active psychosis, suicidality, and bipolar disorder). Adults with ADHD, particularly hyperactiveimpulsive or combined presentation, frequently exhibit psychiatric comorbidity (62) . Active, untreated bipolar disorder is commonly considered a contraindication to surgery, and equivocal results suggest patients with bipolar disorder may experience less post-surgery weight loss (15) . While patients were not specifically screened for bipolar disorder during study recruitment, a registered clinical psychologist at the CABSC conducted pre-surgical psychosocial assessments to identify potential contraindications for surgery, including active psychosis, suicidality, or severe psychopathology.Patients with unmanaged active psychopathology would not be placed on the waitlist for bariatric surgery and were not included in the present sample.In conclusion, the results of this study represent a novel cumulative risk model for bariatric surgery outcomes. Specifically, having combined ADHD and low ESR may convey higher risk for suboptimal surgery outcomes relative to having one or neither condition. Further research is needed to determine whether this effect persists in larger, more representative samples of patients seeking bariatric surgery and among patients with a clear clinical diagnosis of ADHD.", "citance": "This result is not atypical to the literature examining associations between pre-surgical psychological distress and post-surgery weight loss, which has been equivocal (13) (14) (15) 58) .", "claims": [{"text": "No strong relationship has been found between psychological distress preceding bariatric surgery and post-surgery weight loss.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Psychological distress preceding bariatric surgery exhibits a strong negative association with post-surgery weight loss.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}

Whereas CD13(-) proliferating cancer stem cells are sensitive to chemotherapy, CD13(+) dormant cancer stem cells are associated with the development of resistance to chemotherapy. CD13(+) cells in hypoxic areas of the tumour survive chemotherapy, leading to subsequent disease relapse and metastasis. Whether CD13(+) dormant cells simply resume proliferation following therapy or whether they also acquire greater malignant potential, remains unknown. The mechanisms involved also remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated the repair of DNA damage in CD13(+) dormant and CD13(-) proliferating cells. Total RNA was extracted from tissues, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed for specific genes and GAPDH following PCR. Products were then subjected to a temperature gradient of 55-95\u00b0C with continuous fluorescence monitoring to generate a melting curve. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies, washed twice, incubated with fluorescent-labelled secondary antibodies for 30 min on ice and analyzed by flow cytometry. The results revealed that the repair of DNA damage in CD13(+) dormant cells occurs predominantly through non-homologous end-joining, a repair process that is error-prone, whereas CD13(-) proliferating cells primarily utilise high-fidelity homologous recombination for DNA repair. These data indicate that not only is dormancy a protective mechanism for cancer stem cells to survive therapy, but it also enhances the generation and accumulation of mutations following DNA damage.

The aim of this study was to ascertain the characteristics of treatment periods resulting in death and the risk factors involved on the basis of treatment registers and death certificates.   METHODS Data on all treatment periods for persons over 44 years of age with a principal diagnosis of COPD that began as emergency admissions applying to the period 1993-2001 was gathered from the hospital treatment register maintained by the Finnish National Research and Development Centre for Welfare and Health, yielding a total of 72 896 cases. Data on the deaths of the patients concerned was then obtained from Statistics Finland and those treatment periods which could be shown to have ended in death (N = 2331) were taken to form the material for analysis. These were compared with a same number of control hospitalisation periods (not ending in death) in terms of specialisation, type and geographical location of the hospital, length of the treatment period and the occurrence of subsidiary diagnoses. Attention was also paid to the season of the year and the days of the week on which admission and death took place.   RESULTS The proportion of emergency admissions that ended in death was 3.2%, The patients concerned having a mean age of 74.5 years for men and 75.0 years for women on admission. The mean duration of the treatment period was 11.5 days (SD 14.8), compared with 8.0 days (SD 7.9) for the controls. A subsidiary diagnosis existed in the case of 53.6% of the periods ending in death and 37.5% of the control periods. Deaths were most frequent on Fridays, 15.6%, and least so on Tuesdays, 13.0%. Where 24.2% of patients admitted on Saturdays or Sundays died during the first 24 hours, the figure for those admitted on weekdays was only 17.7%. Altogether 62.8% of the treatment periods ending in death took place between December and May.   CONCLUSIONS The COPD patients admitted at weekends showed the poorest survival, while concurrent diseases and protraction of the treatment period in winter and early spring increased the risk of death. Recognition of risk cases on admission could enable mortality to be reduced and allow savings in terms of costs through the intensification of treatment in these cases.", "citation_paragraph": "The Finnish hospital treatment register covers all hospitals in Finland, private and public, and has been shown to be highly reliable, with as much as a 95% congruence with patient records [9] . As only two versions of the classification of diseases were in use in 1993-2001, diagnoses can be assumed to have been fairly consistent over that time. Moreover, the diagnoses of COPD made within the Finnish healthcare system can certainly be regarded as reliable, as they are mostly made by specialists in pulmonary diseases during the whole investigation period for the purpose of entitling patients to the reimbursement of medication costs. However, changes in treatment practice and patient co-morbidity, especially treatments with other main diagnosis have perhaps influenced on the results.Hospital mortality during the acute exacerbation phase of COPD has been reported to vary from 2.5% [10] to 14.4% [11] in different series, and our figure is much closer to the former, the material also being similar in other respects. Where patients were treated in intensive care, mortality figures ranging from 20.3% [12] to 24% [7] have been reported.Where COPD was the cause of death in four cases out of every five of our treatment periods that ended in death, 75% of Zielinski's patients with serious COPD had died in hospital, the most common cause of death being acute respiratory insufficiency [13] .The treatment period was slightly more apt to lead to death if it took place in a department of pulmonary diseases than with any other specialisation, presumably because the most difficult cases were assigned to such departments. Hospital mortality among COPD patients treated in the department of pulmonary diseases of a university hospital in Maastricht, Holland, is reported to have been 8%, with advanced age as a significant risk factor but not the duration of treatment, nor concurrent diseases [14] . In England, hospital mortality in the exacerbation phase of COPD varied significantly according to the type of hospital, the risk being 1.56 times as great in a small hospital than in a teaching hospital or larger, with the resources and the number of specialists among the explanatory factors [15] . Our results nevertheless suggest that the prognosis was no better at a university hospital than elsewhere. The situation is evidently more difficult in the south of Finland than in the north, however, where a smoothly functioning healthcare system and hierarchical grading of treatment modes has been in existence for longer. The networking of services for the treatment of pulmonary diseases began in Lapland in the early 1980s [16] and continued in the 1990s under the auspices of a national programme for the prevention and treatment of respiratory distress [17] .In their study of hospital mortality and survival among patients in the acute exacerbation phase of serious COPD in the USA, Connors et al. [8] reported a mortality of 11% with a mean duration of treatment of 9 days. Our figure, for a somewhat different type of series, was very much lower and the duration of treatment longer, whereas the fact that the relative risk of death within two weeks was 1.71 for treatment periods of more 11 days but 1.0 for periods of less than three days points in much the same direction [18] . While it has been observed in Italy that cardiovascular diseases are fairly common in patients with serious COPD and tend to lead to a poorer prognosis [19] , both Patil's results and our own suggest that other diseases in general increase hospital mortality among COPD patients.The fact that patients admitted on a Saturday or Sunday tended to have a poorer prognosis than those reporting on a weekday may be linked to a shortage of pulmonary specialists on call at weekends. A young emergency department physician may be more reluctant to begin non-invasive ventilation to assist in a situation of respiratory insufficiency, which has been shown to reduce hospital mortality and improve the prognosis [20] . The same factors may also lie behind the high number of deaths on a Friday. A study of the effect of the day of the week on hospital mortality among intensive care patients in England has shown that patients admitted to the unit on a Saturday or Sunday had the highest mortality, the risk attached to Sunday admission being 1.56 relative to Wednesday, for example [21] . Another investigation in the USA has similarly shown patients admitted to intensive care at a weekend to have a significantly higher rate of hospital mortality than those taken in around the middle of the week [22] .The present observation of a higher mortality among COPD patients in winter and spring is reminiscent of the high asthma mortality in the winter months found in Finland [23] and in New Zealand [24] , and also the higher rates of cardiac deaths in Canada [25] and France [26] . Apart from air pollution, the seasonal pattern of mortality from COPD may be explained by the cold winter conditions and the high incidence of respiratory infections [27, 28] .A treatment period for acute exacerbation of COPD was most likely to end in death if the patient was living in the south of Finland, had been admittedly to a ward for pulmonary diseases at a weekend in late winter or early spring, had other concurrent diseases and continued to need treatment for well over a week. The use of non-invasive ventilation should be increased in hospital emergency departments and wards, especially if there is inadequate response to conventional treatment [29] . This would enable treatment times to be shortened, reduce hospital mortality and achieve savings in terms of costs.", "citance": "The use of non-invasive ventilation should be increased in hospital emergency departments and wards, especially if there is inadequate response to conventional treatment [29] .", "claims": [{"text": "Non-invasive ventilation use should be decreased if there is inadequate response to conventional treatment.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Non-invasive ventilation use should be increased if there is inadequate response to conventional treatment.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Cardiovascular disease is the primary cause of death of males in the U.S. and consumes a large share of these healthcare dollars. If untreated, hypertension can lead to heart attack or even death. If detected early, hypertension can often be reversed through diet, exercise, and pharmaceuticals, thus reducing the likelihood of catastrophic disease, hospitalization, and death. The objective of this project was to develop and implement a work-based network environment at Southwest Research Institutereg (SwRIreg) to monitor the arterial health of SwRI employees. The goal of this implementation was to establish a network of existing medical devices and to investigate improving employee health through use of the developed network. Existing blood pressure monitors were modified and connected to the SwRI network. A Web-based system was developed using open source software components and LabVIEWtrade to collect data measured by the blood pressure equipment and to present the collected data to the users. A total of 109 SwRI employees were enrolled in the program. Over a 7(1/2) month period during which blood pressure stations were installed, 1705 blood pressure measurements were obtained. The average systolic and diastolic measurements were 124 and 74, respectively, and 85% of the measurements were either normal or prehypertensive. Overall, 63.3% of the participants utilized a single blood pressure station to obtain measurements, usually the one closest to where they worked", "citation_paragraph": "C ARDIOVASCULAR disease (CVD) is the primary cause of death of all males in the United States and consumes a proportionately large share of healthcare budgets. Hypertension, a condition in which the systolic pressure exceeds 140 mmHg and/or the diastolic pressure exceeds 90 mmHg, can lead to organ damage and death. According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates [1] , the worldwide prevalence of hypertension may be as much as 1 billion individuals, and approximately 7.1 million deaths per year may be attributable to hypertension. The WHO also reports that 62% of cerebrovascular disease and 49% of ischemic heart disease is caused by hypertension. Hypertension is the number one attributable risk for death throughout the world. In the United States, approximately 30% of adults are unaware that they have hypertension, more than 40% of individuals with hypertension are not being treated, and two thirds of patients being treated for hypertension are not being controlled to blood pressures below 140/90 mmHg. In addition, the rates of decline of deaths from coronary heart disease and stroke has slowed in the past decade, but the prevalence and hospitalization rates for heart failure have continued to increase. The majority of heart failure patients have hypertension prior to developing heart failure.The prevalence of hypertension increases with age to the point that roughly 50% of people between the ages of 60 to 69 years old have hypertension. The percentage increases to 75% for people 70 years of age and older. According to the Framingham Heart Study investigators, nonhypertensive people who are 55 years old have a 90% lifetime risk of developing hypertension [2] . Hypertension is a continuous, consistent, and independent risk factor for developing CVD: the higher the blood pressure, the greater the chance of myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and kidney disease. For people between the ages of 40 and 70, each 20 mmHg increment in systolic blood pressure or 10 mmHg increase in diastolic blood pressure doubles the risk of CVD [3] . Clearly, undiagnosed, untreated, and uncontrolled hypertension places a substantial strain on the healthcare delivery system. Adoption of a healthy lifestyle is critical to the prevention of hypertension and the management of those with hypertension. Significant changes to blood pressure can be achieved through relatively simple lifestyle modifications [4, 5] .Many capable, low-cost devices are being manufactured for measuring blood pressure and other physiologic parameters.Currently, multi-parameter vital sign measurement devices are on the market that may be used in the home and can connect to a database.

The present review examines the evidence supporting the use of NPPV in acute respiratory failure (ARF) due to different conditions. Strong evidence supports the use of NPPV for ARF to prevent endotracheal intubation (ETI), as well as to facilitate extubation in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and to avoid ETI in acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, and in immunocompromised patients. Weaker evidence supports the use of NPPV for patients with ARF due to asthma exacerbations, with post-operative or post-extubation ARF, pneumonia, acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or during bronchoscopy. NPPV should be applied under close clinical and physiological monitoring for signs of treatment failure and, in such cases, ETI should be promptly available. A trained team, careful patient selection and optimal choice of devices can optimise outcome of NPPV. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is increasingly being used in the management of acute respiratory failure but caregivers must respect evidence-supported indications and avoid contraidincations. Additionally, the technique must be applied in the appropriate location by a trained team in order to avoid disappointing results.", "citation_paragraph": "A small, single-centre study [74] showed that NPPV also has a role in ARF after solid organ transplantation (liver, lung, renal).

An RCT in patients with ARF and immunosuppression from various causes reported lower mortality and ETI rates in the subgroup of patients treated with NPPV compared with standard treatment. The reduction in mortality was mainly related to the reduction in ETI rate and in the risk of VAP [76] . Similar findings have been reported by a nonrandomised study in patients with AIDS [77] . The reduced mortality rate is likely to be related to reduced infectious complications associated with NPPV compared with ETI, including VAP, other nosocomial infections and septic shock [78] .

The traditional social network-derived methods based on the na\u00efve DTI topology information cannot predict potential targets for new chemical entities or failed drugs in clinical trials. There are currently millions of commercially available molecules with biologically relevant representations in chemical databases. It is urgent to develop novel computational approaches to predict targets for new chemical entities and failed drugs on a large scale. In this study, we developed a useful tool, namely substructure-drug-target network-based inference (SDTNBI), to prioritize potential targets for old drugs, failed drugs and new chemical entities. SDTNBI incorporates network and chemoinformatics to bridge the gap between new chemical entities and known DTI network. High performance was yielded in 10-fold and leave-one-out cross validations using four benchmark data sets, covering G protein-coupled receptors, kinases, ion channels and nuclear receptors. Furthermore, the highest areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.797 and 0.863 for two external validation sets, respectively. Finally, we identified thousands of new potential DTIs via implementing SDTNBI on a global network. As a proof-of-principle, we showcased the use of SDTNBI to identify novel anticancer indications for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs by inhibiting AKR1C3, CA9 or CA12.

The program and predicted DTIs are available on request.", "citation_paragraph": "NSAIDs are a big class of drugs that can be used for antipyretic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. Recently, NSAIDs have shown potential anticancer indications [35] . However, the exact molecular mechanisms of antitumor effects of NSAIDs were still unknown. Herein, to illustrate the practical applications of SDTNBI, we investigated the potential molecular mechanisms of the antitumor effects of NSAIDs, by integrating the known and newly predicted DTIs for NSAIDs via SDTNBI and related gene-disease associations.In this study, NSAIDs were collected from our previous study [36] . Then, potential new targets ranked in the top five with the highest predicted scores were yielded for each NSAID by using the global model Global-FP4 (k \u00bc 2), which showed the best performance in the 10-fold cross validation. The gene symbols of all known and predicted targets were extracted from the UniProt database [37] . The corresponding gene-disease associations were downloaded from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database [38] , and only those curated items covering cancer were retained. The cancers from those gene-cancer associations were subsequently filtered and merged by referring to the MeSH (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/) tree structure categories. Finally, 211 DTIs connecting 21 NSAIDs and 55 targets, and 100 gene-disease associations connecting 28 genes and 29 cancers were obtained ( Figure 4) . A drug-gene-disease subnetwork for these NSAIDs was then constructed using the CytoScape software (version 3.1.1) [39] . Note. FP \u00bc the fingerprint type used in generating drug-substructure linkages; P \u00bc precision; R \u00bc recall; e P 5 precision enhancement; e R \u00bc recall enhancement.As shown in Figure 4 , cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) encoded by PTGS2, a well-known primary target for NSAIDs, has high degree in the drug-gene-disease network. Previous studies have suggested that COX-2 plays crucial roles in cancer [40] , such as colorectal cancer [41] [42] [43] , pancreatic cancer [44] and breast cancer [45] . In addition, inhibition of COX-2 by NSAIDs has potential anticancer indications for colorectal cancer [46] and breast cancer [47] . In this study, we chose several other potential targets that are less reported to have new anticancer indications to explore new potential mechanisms of the anticancer indications for NSAIDs via SDTNBI and network analyses. For instance, AKR1C3, a member of aldo/ketoreductase superfamily, was predicted as a novel potential antitumor target for several NSAIDs. Several previous studies reported that AKR1C3 plays crucial roles in various diseases, including prostate cancer [48] [49] [50] . Previous preclinical studies demonstrated that multiple NSAIDs, such as Diclofenac [51] , Flurbiprofen [52] , Ibuprofen [53] , Indomethacin [54] and Meclofenamic acid [55] , have the potential antiprostate cancer indications. Moreover, NSAIDs have been well characterized as potent AKR1C3 inhibitors based on previously pharmacological experiments [56, 57] and co-crystal structure data [58, 59] . Thus, the predicted interactions such as Diclofenac-AKR1C3 and Ibuprofen-AKR1C3 via SDTNBI were consistent with published evidence. We also found that carbonic anhydrases are potential anticancer targets for several NSAIDs. Several carbonic anhydrase isoforms, including CA9 [60, 61] and CA12 [62, 63] , are associated with breast cancer. Previous studies have reported that NSAIDs, including Acetaminophen [64] and Celecoxib [47] , have potential antibreast cancer effects. Biological assays have showed that NSAIDs, including Acetaminophen, Celecoxib and Valdecoxib, are potent CA9 or CA12 inhibitors [65] [66] [67] . Collectively, inhibiting AKR1C3, CA9 or CA12 by NSAIDs may provide new strategy for cancer chemoprevention.In addition, we also computationally identified new potential anticancer indications for several NSAIDs, such as Carprofen, Etodolac and Rofecoxib, via SDTNBI. Specifically, we computationally identified that CDK2 may be targeted by Carprofen, Etodolac and Rofecoxib (Figure 4) . Previous studies demonstrated that CDK2 plays crucial roles mediating tumorigenesis and tumor progression in several cancer types [68] , such as melanoma [69] and prostate cancer [70] . For example, a recent study showed that Carprofen induces cell apoptosis by targeting the p38 MAPK pathway in prostate cancer cells [71] . Cheng et al. [72] found that Etodolac inhibited CDK2, CDK4 and CDC2 expression and further repressed tumor growth in human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines. Tanaka et al. [73] found that oral doses of Rofecoxib showed a potential value for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. In summary, the potential anticancer indications for Carprofen, Etodolac and Rofecoxib predicted via SDTNBI are consistent with the previous literature evidences. Further study will be needed to provide experimental validations, which we hope will be prompted by the findings herein.

Specific transcription factors play a key role in this process as they modulate the expression of their target genes in an exquisitely lineage-specific manner. A large number of important transcriptional regulators have been identified which establish and maintain specific gene expression patterns during hematopoietic development. Hematopoiesis is therefore a paradigm for investigating how transcription factors function in mammalian cells, thanks also to the evolution of genome-wide and the next-generation sequencing technologies. In this review, we focus on the current knowledge of the biological and functional properties of the hematopoietic master regulator RUNX1 (also known as AML1, CBFA2, PEBP2aB) transcription factor and its main downstream target PU.1. We will outline their relationship in determining the fate of the myeloid lineage during normal stem cell development and under conditions when hematopoietic development is subverted by leukemic transformation.", "citation_paragraph": "Besides its important role in myelopoiesis, RUNX1 is also a master regulator of T-cell differentiation, due to its binding to regulatory elements of T-cell-specific genes [66] . In CD4 + single positive (SP) and CD4 + /CD8 + double positive (DP) T-cells, genome-wide studies have conferred a key role of RUNX1 in the modulation of the expression of these genes via distal elements [67, 68] . In CD4 \u2212 / CD8 \u2212 double negative (DN) and DP thymocytes, RUNX1 enhances the expression of critical genes such as the TCR\u03b1 and \u03b2 loci by binding to their respective enhancers [69, 70] . Furthermore, RUNX1 represses CD4 at the DN and CD8 + SP stages by binding to its silencer element [71, 72] . This repression, however, requires cooperative binding with RUNX3, the latter driving T-cell differentiation towards the CD8 + lineages [73] [74] [75] , reviewed in [76] . At later CD4 + SP, stages, RUNX1 favors Th1 differentiation by inhibiting the expression of GATA3 and IL4 [77, 78] , reviewed in [79] . RUNX1 also suppresses the emergence of regulatory T-cells (Treg) by inhibiting the expression of FOXP3 [80, 81] . In B-cells, the expression of RUNX1 and its binding to enhancer regions of critical pre-B cell transition genes are required for the production and survival of early B-cell progenitors [82] . Early B-cell development is also facilitated by enhanced expression of Ebf1 via the RUNX1-CBF\u03b2 interaction [83] . PU.1 is expressed in early thymocytes up to the DN2 stage, after which its down-regulation is required for normal T-cell development [84] [85] [86] . However, T-cell differentiation is severely impaired in PU.1-deficient mice [34] , indicating a critical role for this transcription factor at the onset of thymopoiesis. This was later confirmed by genome-wide studies whereby binding of PU.1 revealed factor-specific epigenetic marking of crucial early T-cell differentiation genes [87] . In contrast, low levels of PU.1 expression are specifically required for normal B-cell development, since higher levels drive precursors into myeloid differentiation [88, 89] . Similar to T-cells, PU.1 expression is not required for the expression of very early B-cell genes; however, it is essential for the formation of progenitors, as it also regulates the expression of Ebf1 [90] . Likewise, PU.1 triggers chromatin remodeling in early B-cells, followed by deposition of activation-specific histone marks in distal regions later bound by B-cell-specific transcription factors [60] .Consequently, due to their critical role in hematopoiesis, both RUNX1 and PU.1 exhibit oncogenic potential in Band T-cell lineages. In t [12, 21] B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common mutation in child leukemia, the RUNX1-ETV6 fusion protein causes aberrant upregulation of proliferation genes [82, reviewed in 91] . On the other hand, RUNX1 is downregulated or mutated in TLX1 T-ALL, as its normal expression entails tumorsuppressing effects [92] . Conversely, the role of PU.1 in ALL is less established, although it is expressed in most B-ALLs, and that its deletion together with SpiB systematically results in leukemia [93, 94] . In T-ALL recent studies have reported expression of PU.1; however, the mechanisms in which it could contribute towards leukemogenesis remain unclear [93, 95] .", "citance": "On the other hand, RUNX1 is downregulated or mutated in TLX1 T-ALL, as its normal expression entails tumorsuppressing effects [92] .", "claims": [{"text": "Normal expression of RUNX1 causes tumorsupressing effects.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Normal expression of RUNX1 has tumor-promoting effects.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "RUNX1 is downregulated or mutated in TLX1 T-ALL.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Potential conflicts of interest in academic experts advising government and charities on dietary policies", "abstract": "BACKGROUND A conflict of interest (CoI) can occur between public duty and private interest, in which a public official's private-capacity interest could improperly influence the performance of their official duties and responsibilities. The most tangible and commonly considered CoI are financial. However, CoI can also arise due to other types of influence including interpersonal relationships, career progression, or ideology. CoI thus exist in academia, business, government and non-governmental organisations. However, public knowledge of CoI is currently limited due to a lack of information. The mechanisms of managing potential conflicts of interest also remain unclear due to a lack of guidelines. We therefore examined the independence of academic experts and how well potential CoI are identified and addressed in four government and non-governmental organisations in the UK responsible for the development of food policy.   METHODS Policy analysis. We developed an analytical framework to explore CoI in high-level UK food policy advice, using four case studies. Two government policy-making bodies: Department of Health 'Obesity Review Group' (ORG), 'Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition' (SACN) and two charities: 'Action on Sugar' (AoS), & 'Heart of Mersey' (HoM). Information was obtained from publicly available sources and declarations. We developed a five point ordinal scale based upon the ideology of the Nolan Principles of Public Life. Group members were individually categorised on the ordinal ConScale from \"0\", (complete independence from the food and drink industry) to \"4\", (employed by the food and drink industry or a representative organisation).   RESULTS CoI involving various industries have long been evident in policy making, academia and clinical practice. Suggested approaches for managing CoI could be categorised as \"deny\", \"describe\", or \"diminish\". Declared CoI were common in the ORG and SACN. 4 out of 28 ORG members were direct industry employees. In SACN 11 out of 17 members declared industry advisory roles or industry research funding. The two charities appeared to have equally strong academic expertise but fewer conflicts. No HoM members declared CoI. 5 out of 21 AoS members declared links with industry, mainly pharmaceutical companies. We were unable to obtain information on conflicts for some individuals.

Government organisations responsible for policy development and implementation must institutionalize an approach to identify (disclose) and manage (mitigate or eliminate) perceived and actual CoI to improve public confidence in government decision-making relevant to food policy.Keywords: Policy, Food, Industry, Government, Conflict of interests, Declaration, Finance, Advice Background A conflict of interest (CoI) may occur when professional judgment or decisions concerning a primary interest may be unduly influenced by a secondary interest [1] . In relation to public officials, a conflict of interest can occur between public duty and private interest, in which the official's private-capacity interest could improperly influence the performance of their official duties and responsibilities [2] . CoI can arise in different contexts and thus can be defined in different ways. CoI relate to financial interests, when an individual's personal finances may be affected by a decision that he or she has a role in making. Alternatively, non-financial issues-such as personal relationships, business associations, and membership in political or other groups-might make it difficult for an individual to consider policy questions objectively. Ideological conflicts can also occur, for example a more libertarian view that emphasizes individual choice versus a concern with the broader social impact of those choices. In this instance, it is often more difficult to distinguish \"conflicts of interest\" that should be avoided from \"policy disagreements\" that should be addressed in the actions of public office [3] .A conflicted expert will not necessarily be less objective than a non-conflicted counterpart [4] . However, logical concerns are supported by extensive psychological research [5] [6] [7] plus empirical data from the tobacco, alcohol, pharmaceutical and medical device industries. Reviews, including a recent Cochrane meta-analysis [8] show that an individual with financial or other links to a company will likely favour that corporation, consciously or subconsciously [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Poor methodology and publication bias are commonplace in industry funded research [10, 14] . Industry funded literature reviews are also known to be susceptible to industry influence from CoI [9, 15, 16] . Between March and October 2015, Nestle identified 76 industry funded food and nutrition studies. Of these 70 reported results favourable to the sponsors [14] .The National Audit Office state that \"departments and agencies should have a code of ethics or code of conduct. These standards should define what behaviours and practices are acceptable and unacceptable, and should clearly state what will happen when people do not comply.\" They also raise the issue of the potential risk of a legal challenge to decisions made by public bodies. If a decision-maker has a conflict of interest then the decision is potentially vulnerable and could be overturned on judicial review [17] . CoI are concerning and should be examined in order to ensure objectivity is maintained and those in public office are open to scrutiny. Identifying and preventing or resolving CoI situations is crucial to good governance and maintaining trust in government decisions and policy.Applying the CoI label does not imply that the conflicted expert is necessarily guilty of collusion or corruption. However, current or past financial or personal associations with interested parties make it difficult to distinguish subtle, unconscious bias from deliberately concealed impropriety. Being 'conflicted' thus also means 'potentially conflicted', as the term can be applied before key events, such as decision-making or research publication. Perceived CoI are also important, potentially tarnishing the reputation of scientists, organisations or corporations [2, 17, 18] . This then offers scope for preventive measures.In the UK, The Nolan Principles of Public Life [19] (Table 1) demand standards of professional conduct and integrity for public officials. In use since 1995, these principles aim to combat the risks (bias towards financial, business/industry interests), that CoI pose to procedures conducted for the public good. Neglecting the application of these principles could foreseeably cause a great number of problems, in terms of objectivity and accountability, both politically and for evidence-based public health. However, it is less clear whether central UK government routinely follows these principles when eliciting advice on food policy.Public health policy in England comes mainly from the Department of Health (DH). The DH has successfully implemented strategies on tobacco control, alcohol, physical activity and food [20, 21] . Currently, high rates of obesity and diabetes in adults and children in the UK have recently fuelled increasing concern about sugar intake [22] [23] [24] . Government food policy is now under increasing scrutiny [13] .However, any regulation or tax on sugar would potentially threaten transnational corporations' sales and profits. Industry opposition might therefore be predicted using a variety of denialism tactics, including influencing scientific researchers, and hence the expert advice given to policy makers [8] .Gornell uncovered a \"tangled web\" of connections between the sugar industry and UK government advisory bodies with key public health experts involved with the sugar industry and related companies responsible for many of the products blamed for the obesity crisis through research grants, consultancy fees, and other forms of funding [25] . Some of the experts whose reputations were publicly questioned subsequently responded to defend these allegations [26] , however the concern is that a CoI may bias behaviour, and it is the potential for bias that makes CoI important [27] .Many governments are now emphasizing public/private partnerships [28] [29] [30] , resulting in closer ties to industry. Subsequent CoI are becoming increasingly common within decision-making groups. By influencing the academic evidence base and subsequent discussion in policy making groups, powerful corporations with vested interests and considerable public, political and media influence are well positioned to lobby governments. This can cause governments to base policy not on nutrition and public health effects of their products but on wealth creation and the financial and employment potential of their companies.The normalisation of public/private partnerships has generally fostered a relaxed attitude towards the impact of CoI [31] . Indeed, many at risk individuals claim that CoI are unlikely to cause problems [32, 33] . Academics aspire to be independent and objective, but they are also human, and therefore vulnerable to potential CoI. Adams (2007) suggests the concept of a 'continuum' of moral jeopardy is preferable to a 'binary' interpretation, [34] with a scale ranging from those with minor involvements to those with unmanageable conflicts of interest. He suggests active scrutiny of these risks can be assisted through strategies that promote ongoing self-assessment [34] . Many academics assert that their academic integrity and self-assessment will nullify any potential bias from commercial CoI [35] . However, the evidence shows otherwise. CoI have been consistently linked to biased outcomes, which compromise the quality of academic evidence and undermine supposedly 'evidence based' decisions [11] [12] [13] [14] .Although the full influence of industry is not known, it is possible that high-level food policy decisions in the UK may be affected by corporate attempts to influence policy. This has certainly been highlighted in papers by Moodie [8] , Stuckler [36] and most recently by Gornall [25] .However, public knowledge of CoI is currently limited due to a lack of information and the complexity of this issue. The mechanisms for identifying and managing potential conflicts of interest also remain unclear [2, 17, 18] .We therefore examined four contrasting governmental and non-governmental organisations in the UK responsible for developing food policy based on current research (The Department of Health 'Obesity Review Group' (ORG), The 'Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition' (SACN) and two charities: ' Action on Sugar' (AoS), and 'Heart of Mersey' (HoM) (Additional file 1: Appendices 1 -6). All four use academic topic experts to give advice and help formulate public policy. We asked:How independent of industry influence are these academic \"experts\" and how well are potential conflicts of interest identified and addressed?", "citance": "The normalisation of public/private partnerships has generally fostered a relaxed attitude towards the impact of CoI [31] .", "claims": [{"text": "Normalization of public/private partnerships generally creates a relaxed attitude towards the impact of conflict of interest (Col)", "subject": "impact of conflict of interest (Col)", "is_negation": false}]}

For example, it is now possible to place adult skin or blood cells in a dish and convert them into neurons, liver, or heart cells. It is also possible to literally \"rejuvenate\" adult cells by reprogramming them into embryonic-like stem cells, which in turn can be differentiated into every tissue and cell type of the human body. Our ability to reprogram cell types has four main implications for medicine: (1) scientists can now take skin or blood cells from patients and convert them to other cells to study disease processes. This disease modeling approach has the advantage over animal models because it is directly based on human patient cells. (2) Reprogramming could also be used as a \"clinical trial in a dish\" to evaluate the general efficacy and safety of newly developed drugs on human patient cells before they would be tested in animal models or people. (3) In addition, many drugs have deleterious side effects like heart arrhythmias in only a small and unpredictable subpopulation of patients. Reprogramming could facilitate precision medicine by testing the safety of already approved drugs first on reprogrammed patient cells in a personalized manner prior to administration. For example, drugs known to sometimes cause arrhythmias could be first tested on reprogrammed heart cells from individual patients. (4) Finally, reprogramming allows the generation of new tissues that could be grafted therapeutically to regenerate lost or damaged cells.", "citation_paragraph": "As briefly stated in the introduction, John Gurdon showed that even somatic cells can be reactivated by the oocyte to form mature fertile animals by transplanting nuclei of cultured intestinal cells of Xenopus tadpoles into enucleated oocytes (Fig. 1a) [3] . Subsequent experiments using different adult cell types only yielded swimming tadpoles, suggesting that the starting cell population may be restricted in their degree of plasticity or that reprogramming was not complete [16] . For many years, similar experiments in higher vertebrates failed and the field was dominated by the notion that mammalian cells have lost the plasticity of amphibian cells. It was only in 1996 when Ian Wilmut and his co-workers demonstrated that it is possible to generate live animals by nuclear transfer of adult mammalian cells when they successfully cloned the famous sheep Dolly [17] . In the coming years, many other mammalian species were successfully cloned including mice, rats, cats, dogs, cows, and others [18] . But for a long time, it remained unclear whether nuclear transfer could also reprogram human cells. Just a few years ago, this question was resolved and several groups convincingly showed that adult human fibroblasts can be transferred into human oocytes, which can give rise to blastocysts containing expandable pluripotent cells [19] [20] [21] .", "citance": "Just a few years ago, this question was resolved and several groups convincingly showed that adult human fibroblasts can be transferred into human oocytes, which can give rise to blastocysts containing expandable pluripotent cells [19] [20] [21] .", "claims": [{"text": "Nuclear transfer from adult human fibroblasts to human oocytes can give rise to blastocysts containing expandable pluripotent cells.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 29002318, "title": "Molecular pathways linking metabolic inflammation and thermogenesis.", "abstract": "Obesity is caused by chronic positive energy balance because of higher energy intake relative to energy expenditure. Thermogenesis, the capacity of an organism to produce heat, is an important component of energy expenditure. Thus targeting the molecular mechanisms controlling thermogenesis could be an effective strategy for the prevention or treatment of obesity. Thermogenesis is modulated by three major factors: environmental temperature, nutrient quantity and quality, and by systemic inflammation. Obesity is now recognized to be a state of chronic low-grade systemic inflammation, which has been proposed to play a major role in the pathogenesis of obesity and obesity-associated diseases. This review discussed the molecular pathways that are recruited during metabolic inflammation and that are also implicated in the control of thermogenesis and energy balance. It emerges that the complex signalling network recruited during metabolic inflammation exerts a balanced action on the modulation of thermogenesis and energy balance, with some pathways promoting weight gain whereas other pathways have opposite actions. It is thus concluded that immunomodulation of metabolic inflammation, rather than an anti-inflammatory intervention aiming at its suppression, may be a more promising strategy to increase thermogenesis for the treatment or prevention of obesity and its associated diseases.", "citation_paragraph": "PAMPs from gram-negative bacteria are most potent exogenous pyrogens, which paradoxically can also cause hypothermia depending on the experimental conditions. Gut microbiota has been identified as an environmental factor implicated in energy balance (56) . The gut microbial population is altered during obesity (44) , and it has been shown that HFD increases the circulating levels of LPS (45) . In a study investigating the effects of metabolic endotoxemia on obesity, LPS levels were chronically elevated to the concentration observed in HFD-fed mice for 4 weeks by continuous LPS infusion using an osmotic pump (45) . Strikingly, LPS-infused mice kept on low-fat diet displayed higher weight gain than control saline-infused mice on low-fat diet, with the greater weight gain being similar to mice kept on HFD. However, whereas the increased weight gain on HFD-fed mice compared with low-fat diet-fed mice was largely due to increased energy intake, in LPS-infused mice energy intake was significantly lower than HFD-fed mice and similar to the one observed in low-fat diet-fed mice. This observation suggests that chronic low-grade endotoxemia may promote feed efficiency by reducing apparent energy expenditure.TLR-4 was identified as a major sensor for bacterial LPS, and it was proposed that TLR-4 might be a sensor for saturated free fatty acids (57) . Nonetheless, the role of TLR-4 in diet-induced obesity is less obvious as different studies investigating TLR-4 loss of function in mice models of diet-induced obesity have reported different results, ranging from increased predisposition to obesity to a dramatic protection from diet-induced obesity compared with wild-type (WT) control mice (57) (58) (59) . Whereas such discrepancies suggest that the impact of TLR-4 signalling on energy balance may depend on the specific experimental conditions, it should be noted that when loss of functional TLR-4 was linked to increased weight gain, this was largely due to increased food intake (57), whereas when resistance to diet-induced obesity was observed, this was explained by increased thermogenesis (58) . Thus, it cannot be excluded that TLR-4 signalling might have opposing effects on food intake and thermogenesis in models of diet-induced obesity and might therefore either promote or antagonize positive energy balance depending on the specific experimental condition. Still, the precise role of TLR-4 on thermogenesis and energy balance in body weight homeostasis and obesity remains to be established.The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors (NLR) are a family of intracellular PAMPs and DAMPs receptors implicated in pathogen and damage sensing (60) . A study reported that mice lacking two NLR family members NOD1 and NOD2 display reduced adiposity when placed on HFD compared with WT mice (61). However, this leaner phenotype could be partially explained by increased spontaneous physical activity and decreased food intake. Thus, at this stage, it is not clear whether NOD1 and NOD2 may also play a role in the control of thermogenesis. Another NLR family member that was recently implicated in metabolic inflammation and energy balance is the NOD-like receptor NLRP-3 Some evidence suggests that TNFa may also promote positive energy balance and negatively regulate thermogenesis. As indicated here, these cytokines may control thermogenesis via the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). However, possible peripheral actions should also be considered. Intact leptin signalling is known to be a basic requirement for efficient thermogenesis in response to cold and food. Thus insufficient leptin signalling (e.g. leptin resistance) may lead to defective thermogenesis promoting positive energy balance and obesity.(NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing protein). NLRP-3 is an intracellular receptor that forms a large complex with other proteins called the inflammasome, which is implicated in sensing different PAMPs and DAMPs (62) . Activation of NLRP-3 leads to the recruitment of the caspase-1 protease via the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosisassociated speck-like protein containing a carboxy-terminal CARD), leading to proteolytic cleavage of IL-1b and IL-18 precursors to generate their mature forms, which are then secreted. Mutations of NLRP-3 in humans, also known as cryopyrin, were found to cause familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome, a rare genetic disease characterized by episodes of systemic inflammation and fever triggered or exacerbated by acute cold exposure (63, 64) . Thus, such genetic condition strongly suggests that on top of the function of pathogen and damage sensor, NLRP-3 might also act as a 'cold sensor'. NLRP3 was proposed to play a major role in linking obesity-induced lipotoxicity to metabolic inflammation and insulin resistance. Indeed, mice lacking NLRP-3 display decreased inflammasome activation and improved insulin sensitivity in models of diet-induced obesity (65) . However, it is important to notice that in this study, mice lacking NLRP-3 kept on HFD showed decreased epididymal fat pad weight and dramatically decreased adipocyte size and lipid accumulation in the liver compared with WT control mice. These data suggest that at least part of the beneficial effects of NLRP-3 inactivation on metabolic inflammation and insulin resistance could be the indirect consequence of decreased adiposity and ectopic lipid, suggesting a role for NLRP-3 and the inflammasome in energy balance. Consistent with this interpretation, another study showed that mice lacking either NLRP-3, the adapter ASC or caspase-1 inflammasome proteins display decreased weight gain compared with WT control mice kept on HFD (66) . Mice lacking one of the essential inflammasome components (NLRP-3, ASC or caspase-1) and WT control mice displayed similar caloric intake suggesting that differences in weight gain are likely due to decreased feeding efficiency and hence to increased apparent energy expenditure of mutant mice (66) . Consistently, compared with WT controls, mice lacking caspase-1 displayed increased energy expenditure on a HFD, as measured by indirect calorimetry. These latter results are in sharp contrast with a more recent study showing a protective action of the inflammasome in the progression of diet-induced obesity, glucose intolerance and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, by maintaining a 'healthier' gut microbiota (67) . Collectively, these studies suggest that the inflammasome complex plays an important role in the control of thermogenesis and energy balance in mice models of diet-induced obesity. Overall, the interpretation of these studies is complex, and for the future, it will be important to discriminate between possible role of the inflammasome in the ecology of gut microbiota and the direct effects on thermogenesis, energy balance and glucose homeostasis.", "citance": "The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors (NLR) are a family of intracellular PAMPs and DAMPs receptors implicated in pathogen and damage sensing (60) .", "claims": [{"text": "Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors are implicated in pathogen and damage sensing.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 39000859, "title": "Coeliac disease \u2013 a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge", "abstract": "Abstract During the past 20 years the diagnosis of coeliac disease has improved significantly. However, at the same time the true prevalence of the condition has doubled, involving more than 2% of the population in some countries. Due to mild or atypical symptoms, the diagnosis remains a challenge for the health care system. Highly sensitive and specific serum endomysial and transglutaminase-2 antibody tests are helpful in identifying patients for diagnostic endoscopy and small-bowel biopsy. The diagnosis of the disease is still based on the demonstration of gluten-induced small-bowel mucosal villous atrophy with crypt hyperplasia. However, coeliac disease may manifest itself before the development of the overt small-intestinal lesion. Positive endomysial and transglutaminase antibodies in patients with normal small-bowel mucosal villous architecture may indicate early stage coeliac disease. Currently, the only effective treatment for the condition is a life-long strict gluten-free diet. Long-term regular follow-up of patients is recommended in order to maintain good adherence to the diet. Clin Chem Lab Med 2010;48:1205\u201316.", "citation_paragraph": "Currently, the only effective treatment for coeliac disease is a life-long gluten-free diet, which implies permanent elimination of wheat, rye and barley from the diet. With changes in diet, clinical improvement is achieved within weeks and the small bowel mucosal damage recovers in 1-2 years (112, 113) . While it is generally agreed that a gluten-free diet should be as strict as possible, a diet completely devoid of gluten is probably impossible to maintain. The products on the market, even naturally gluten-free foods, may contain trace amounts of contaminating gluten (114) . The safe threshold for gluten in gluten-free products has recently been under investigation. According to several studies, it appears that daily intake of 10-20 mg gluten per day is harmless, whereas daily gluten intake over 200-500 mg (corresponding to occasional dietary lapses) seems to induce small bowel villous damage and inflammation (115, 116) . By comparison, the normal Western diet contains 10-20 g of gluten per day.Despite evidence that oats are well-tolerated by the majority of patients with coeliac disease, the inclusion of oats in a gluten free diet is still matter of debate. Oats are a grain phylogenetically different from wheat, rye and barley, and its prolamine content is lower than that of other cereals (117) . Evidence shows that the consumption of oats in patients with coeliac disease has not had a detrimental effect on small bowel mucosal villous morphology or symptoms, even with long-term use (118) (119) (120) . Oats diversifies a gluten-free diet and enhances its nutritional quality by increasing the intake of dietary fibre, and many coeliac patients therefore prefer to consume some oats (121) . Fear of contamination of oat products with other gluten containing cereals has restricted their use (122) , but pure oat products with strictly controlled production systems are now available on the market. In rare cases, an individual may be intolerant to pure oats, and there are case reports showing that oat-intolerant coeliac patients may have oat specific inflammatory cells in the small bowel mucosa (123) . Long-term regular follow-up of coeliac subjects is recommended for all patients whether using oats or not.After the diagnosis of coeliac disease is established, the patient should be assessed for deficiencies of vitamins and minerals, including iron and folic acid. Any deficiencies should be treated and followed every 3-6 months as needed. The first actual follow-up visit is usually after 1 year of the commencement of a gluten-free diet; in adults a follow-up biopsy is still recommended (124) . However, in children, usually clinical and serological response is sufficient, although continuous monitoring of growth and development is needed. If the response to the gluten-free diet after 1 year has been adequate, long-term regular clinical and serological follow-up is still advisable.Occasionally, patients with coeliac disease do not respond to a gluten-free diet (113, 124) . It appears that the most common reason for persistent villous atrophy is continuous intentional or unintentional gluten consumption (125) . Dietary compliance studies show that 17%-90% of coeliac patients adhere to a strict diet (126) . A more infrequent reason for the lack of histological response is refractory coeliac disease (113, 127) . This is a serious condition with the potential to develop into ulcerative jejunitis and further to enteropathyassociated T-cell lymphoma (128) . A subset of patients suffering from type II refractory coeliac disease present with a lack of surface expression of CD3q and CD8q T-cell receptor complexes in IELs and a clonal rearrangement of the g chain of the T-cell receptor, both regarded as markers of poor prognosis for the condition (127, 129) . Refractory coeliac disease patients without abnormal immunophenotype of small bowel mucosal IELs (type I) seem to profit from immunosuppressive treatment with, for example, corticoste- roids (128) . Type II refractory coeliac disease is usually resistant to available treatments, although new drugs, such as cladribine and anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody are being used (128) . Some reports indicate that autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation might be useful in such patients (129) . Due to the extremely restrictive nature of a life-long gluten-free diet, strict adherence is burdensome (110) and new treatment options are therefore warranted. An improved understanding of the molecular basis of coeliac disease has enabled researchers to suggest novel alternatives to gluten free dietary treatment (Table 3 ). Due to the high proline content, gluten peptides are highly resistant to gastrointestinal digestive proteases (70) . Enzyme supplement therapy using either bacterial or fungal endopeptidases or proteases from germinating wheat has been proposed to promote complete digestion of cereal proteins and destroy disease inducing gluten peptides (133, 134) . Clinical phase II studies using these enzymes are currently ongoing. Other promising approaches include modulation of intestinal permeability, prevention of gluten presentation to T cells by blocking the binding of gluten epitopes to HLA-DQ2 molecules (137), use of TG2 inhibitors (136) , down regulation of immune response by antibodies against proinflammatory cytokines (77, 141) , and promotion of tolerance by other immunomodulatory strategies (Table 3 ). All the previously mentioned strategies need to be investigated in large long-term clinical studies to assess their safety and clinical effectiveness.", "citance": "In rare cases, an individual may be intolerant to pure oats, and there are case reports showing that oat-intolerant coeliac patients may have oat specific inflammatory cells in the small bowel mucosa (123) .", "claims": [{"text": "Oat tolerant coeliac patients may have oat specific inflammatory cells in their small bowel mucosa.", "subject": "coeliac patients", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 27215456, "title": "Noncoding RNAs and the control of hormonal signaling via nuclear receptor regulation.", "abstract": "Despite its identification over 100 years ago, new discoveries continue to add to the complexity of the regulation of the endocrine system. Today the nuclear receptors (NRs) that play such a pivotal role in the extensive communication networks of hormones and gene expression remain an area of intense research. By orchestrating core processes, from metabolism to organismal development, the gene expression programs they control are dependent on their cellular context, their own levels, and those of numerous co-regulatory proteins. A previously unknown component of these networks, noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are now recognized as potent regulators of NR signaling, influencing receptor and co-factor levels and functions while being reciprocally regulated by the NRs themselves. This review explores the regulation enacted by microRNAs and long ncRNAs on NR function, using representative examples to show the varied roles of ncRNAs, in turn producing significant effects on the NR functional network in health and disease.", "citation_paragraph": "Advances in high-throughput sequencing techniques have revealed eukaryotic genomes to be extensively transcribed, generating an array of novel non-proteincoding RNA classes that greatly outnumber protein-coding mRNAs (Carninci et al. 2005 , Birney et al. 2007 , Kapranov et al. 2007 , Bernstein et al. 2012 , Djebali et al. 2012 . Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) encompass numerous functional classes including tRNA, rRNA, small nuclear RNA, and small nucleolar RNA, widely recognized to play pivotal roles in cell function (reviewed in Matera et al. (2007) ). More recently, new and potent classes of regulatory RNAs have been discovered. These classes are composed of small RNAs, most prominently the microRNAs (miRNAs), as well as the long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) defined as being over 200 nucleotides (nt) but ranging to above 10 000-nt. In succession, these discoveries have created new fields in cell biological research, exploring the ability of ncRNAs to regulate the expression of biologically significant genes. It soon became clear that they have the capacity to modulate most important biological processes (Hirose et al. 2014 ), which in turn makes these ncRNAs a focus of interest within health and disease research (Batista & Chang 2013) . miRNAs make up a populous class of small ncRNAs, with more than 2000 human miRNA genes annotated to date in the miRNA database, miRBase (http://www. mirbase.org). Most miRNAs are transcribed as long miRNA primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) (Lee et al. 2004) , which then undergo a canonical biogenic process characterized by two sequential enzymatic cleavage steps. The first occurs in the nucleus by the nuclear RNAse III enzyme Drosha and the second in the cytoplasm by a second RNAse III enzyme, Dicer. This maturation process generates the final mature molecules which are loaded onto the miRNA-induced silencing complex, composed of Argonaute (Ago) proteins (reviewed in Krol et al. (2010) ). Mature miRNAs are approximately 22-nt single-stranded RNA molecules that mediate post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression either by inhibiting translation or by promoting destabilization of target mRNAs through deadenylation (Fabian et al. 2010 , Krol et al. 2010 . In mammals, miRNAs regulate post-transcriptional gene expression by partial complementary binding to their targets, but with full complementary pairing within a limited region of six to eight nt in length at the 5 0 end of the miRNA, named the 'seed' region (Lewis et al. 2005 , Bartel 2009 ). The perfect complementarity between the miRNA seed region and target mRNAs is considered to be the major determinant of miRNA target specificity and regulation. However, many studies have also reported noncanonical modulation of targets, which can occur with mismatches within the seed region or the central region of the miRNA (Bartel 2009 , Shin et al. 2010 , Helwak et al. 2013 . The lncRNAs are an emerging class of key regulatory ncRNAs that have already been implicated in a range of cellular processes (Wapinski & Chang 2011 , Rinn & Chang 2012 . Similar to mRNAs, lncRNAs are mostly transcribed by RNA Pol II, undergo 5 0 -capping, and usually 3 0 -polyadenylation and splicing, although diverse unspliced and non-3 0 -polyadenylated lncRNAs have been described. Unlike mRNAs, lncRNAs have very little or no potential to encode proteins, and although the extent of their coding capacity remains under investigation, results from ribosome profiling experiments indicate that most occupancy of ribosomes by lncRNAs mirrors that of 5 0 -UTRs and fails to produce functional peptides (Guttman et al. 2013) . Nevertheless, three groups independently identified peptides encoded by such molecules with specific cellular functions (Magny et al. 2013 , Bazzini et al. 2014 , Pauli et al. 2014 . Some lncRNAs are located between protein-coding genes and termed long intergenic RNAs (lincRNAs), while many others can be transcribed from within the coding genes or in an antisense orientation to mRNAs. The lncRNAs regulate gene expression through an expanding number of defined mechanisms. The relative flexibility of RNA molecules may enable them to function as modular scaffolds, with different sections of a lncRNA binding various protein, DNA, and RNA substrates, to carry out specific functions in combination (Guttman & Rinn 2012 , Mercer & Mattick 2013 . Nuclear receptors (NRs) are ligand-activated transcription factors that regulate gene expression by binding to regulatory regions in the genomic DNA. NRs are critically involved in an array of physiological processes including growth, differentiation, homeostasis, development, and metabolism (Mangelsdorf et al. 1995) . Conversely, dysregulated NR signaling participates in a range of pathological processes, with NRs implicated in diseases such as diabetes, hormone resistance syndromes, and cancer. Forty-eight NRs have been identified in humans (Xiao et al. 2013) . Upon ligand binding, these receptors interact with specific DNA sequences in the promoter and enhancer regions of their target genes. The transcription of regulated genes is modulated by co-binding of an array of co-factors as well as RNA polymerases and several components of the transcription initiation machinery (Acevedo & Kraus 2004 , Cheung & Kraus 2010 , Hah et al. 2011 . Based on ligand properties, the NR superfamily can be broadly divided into three classes: hormone, metabolic, and orphan NRs (Gadaleta & Magnani 2014) . The hormone receptor subfamily includes the estrogen receptors (ERa (ESR1) and ERb (ESR2)), androgen receptor (AR), progesterone receptor (PR), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) (Mangelsdorf et al. 1995) . In terms of structural organization, NRs share a modular structure composed of four domains: an N-terminal activation domain, a DNA-binding domain (DBD), a small hinge region, and a C-terminal ligandbinding domain (LBD) (Helsen & Claessens 2014) . Hormone NRs bind to DNA primarily as homodimers. The DBD consists of two zinc finger domains in which a zinc atom is coordinated by four cysteine residues . The first zinc finger contains a conserved motif known as the 'P-box' that coordinates base-specific interactions within the DNA major groove. The second zinc finger contains another conserved motif, the 'D-box', which forms the dimerization interface (Zechel et al. 1994) . Hormone NRs have long been known to bind to DNA elements that are arranged as inverted repeats of hexameric motifs separated by three nucleotide spacers. For AR, PR, GR, and MR, the consensus hexamer is 5 0 -AGAACA-3 0 . For ERs, the consensus is 5 0 -AGGTCA-3 0 (Carroll et al. 2006) . In addition, AR and PR can also bind to direct repeats of the 5 0 -AGAACA-3 0 motifs (Denayer et al. 2010 . Recently, chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with massively parallel DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) has allowed detailed mapping of NR-binding sites across the whole genome and has revealed a strong preference for hormone NRs to bind regions of the genome that are distal from transcription start sites of coding genes (O10 kb) (Carroll et al. 2005 , Wang et al. 2007 ). These studies have also shown enrichment for binding motifs of other transcription factors, indicating that NRs can bind to DNA indirectly through interaction with other transcription factors (Heldring et al. 2011 , Sahu et al. 2011 . Furthermore, it has been shown that multiple NRs can bind to the same genomic locus, indicating an important crosstalk between different NR signaling pathways through cooperative or antagonistic interactions (Ross-Innes et al.", "citance": "Unlike mRNAs, lncRNAs have very little or no potential to encode proteins, and although the extent of their coding capacity remains under investigation, results from ribosome profiling experiments indicate that most occupancy of ribosomes by lncRNAs mirrors that of 5 0 -UTRs and fails to produce functional peptides (Guttman et al. 2013) .", "claims": [{"text": "Occupancy of ribosomes by IncRNAs do not make functional peptides.", "subject": "IncRNAs", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Occupancy of ribosomes by IncRNAs mirror 5 0-UTRs ", "subject": "IncRNAs", "is_negation": false}]}

About 20% of patients suffer from complications after mesh insertion in the anterior vaginal wall. Autologous plasma coating of meshes prior to implantation has shown potential to improve the biocompatibility of meshes in vivo and in vitro. This innovative approach has been developed according to the IDEAL recommendations for surgical innovations. The method has still to be assessed at stage 3 accordingly. A protocol is developed for a prospective single-blinded randomized controlled phase II trial for biocompatibility optimization of anterior vaginal meshes for prolapse repair by autologous plasma coating versus non-coated meshes. The protocol aims at fulfilling the requirements for stage 3 (assessment) according to IDEAL. Eligible for inclusion are women with primary cystocele, requiring a surgical procedure, suitable for randomization, and willing to be randomized. Participants will be followed up by postal questionnaires (6 months post surgery and 12 months post randomization) and will also be reviewed in clinic 12 and 24 months post surgery. Primary endpoint is the assessment of mesh-related complications following the Clavien\u2013Dindo classifications. QoL, sexual function assessment, efficacy, and validation of an already developed long-term register are considered secondary endpoints. To afford a calculated 10% reduction of postoperative complications through plasma-coated meshes vs. non-coated meshes at 1-year follow-up, a total 214 women in each arm will be necessary to achieve 80% power at a significance level of 5%. The protocol for this randomized clinical trial represents the conditions to assess the surgical innovation of plasma coating of meshes in order to improve the meshes\u2019 biocompatibility at stage 3 according to the IDEAL recommendations.", "citation_paragraph": "On the basis of extended in vitro and in vivo preliminary results we hypothesized that autologous plasma coating of meshes prior to implantation improves the mesh's biocompatibility. It should therefore result in a lower mesh-related complication rate in the intervention group compared to the patient group with na\u00efve meshes. The entire preliminary experimental approach has been strictly performed following the IDEAL recommendations for surgical innovations and our group has already implemented an online-based registry as stage 4 (long-term study). In conclusion, this study has two paramount aims: (1) to investigate the hypothesis of improved biocompatibility of plasma-coated meshes compared to na\u00efve meshes and (2) to fulfill the final and missing stage 3 (assessment stage) of this novel method of mesh plasma coating.When aiming to complete the development process of a surgical innovation according to the IDEAL recommendations a clinical trial (preferably randomized in nature) is necessary to fulfill the requirements for the assessment stage. In this particular project we have already been able to develop an online-based registry providing with the required tool for the longterm study. Thus, by publishing a study protocol for assessing autologous plasma coating of meshes in the specific indication of POP surgery all IDEAL stages will be displayed and completed for this innovative surgical approach. It will therefore be the first reported surgical innovation which has been visualized according to IDEAL at every step of development [20] .Appropriate trial registration is another important issue for this study protocol. We have chosen Research Registry \u00d2 (www. researchregistry.com). This registry is free of charge and very easy to handle. In addition, it features the main reporting recommendations. The registry had reportedly received 500 registrations by September 2016 [33] . It represents a valuable tool to officially visualize study protocols even when funding/sponsoring are not confirmed yet as is the case in this current protocol. Chapman and colleagues reported that one in five surgical randomized controlled trials (RCT) are discontinued early, and one in three will not be published 2 years after trial conclusion [35] . Easy and smart trial registration tools are important to avoid redundancy and to help visualizing protocols in order to prespecify research questions and outcomes and, last but not least, to document protocols even when trials cannot be conducted or concluded for unforeseeable reasons (recruitment problems etc.).Choice of the appropriate measurement tool for QoL after POP surgery can be challenging. In this protocol the assessment of sexual function will be done with the Pelvic Organ Prolapse/ Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire IUGA Revised (PISQ-IR) which is the most appropriate questionnaire and even offers a validated German translation [26, 27] . Being composed of 12 different items, three main factor groups are displayed in this questionnaire: the behavioral emotive factor (4 items), the physical factor (5 items), and the partner-related factor score (3 items). In a recent study, Vitale and co-workers successfully used this tool to evaluate sexual function after cystocele repair with porcine mesh graft in 20 women and proved it to be a feasible tool in this indication [36] . For QoL measurement they use the Short Form-36 (SF-36) validated questionnaire which poses 36 questions and is grouped into eight assessed categories [37] . It represents a very easy to use tool for QoL assessment. However, in this protocol we have chosen the POP-QoL, ICS SF-2004 for QoL assessment which has also been validated in German and is easy to answer and commonly used [30] .The paramount strength of this protocol is the amount of already available supporting data on the experimental method of plasma coating for meshes and it's positive effect on biocompatibilty. Several groups have developed coating strategies of meshes used in prolapse surgery. Mesh coating with collagen has been mainly investigated in animal studies showing positive effects on biocompatibility [38] [39] [40] [41] . However, this approach has not shown convincing results for the treatment of anterior vaginal wall prolapse when applying it in humans [42, 43] .Other techniques like coating with highly purified collagen or fetal collagen both in a rat model [44, 45] and platelet-enriched plasma in a rabbit model [46] have shown promising biocompatibility improvements in vivo. Even a study using a macaques model for the investigation of extracellular matrix regenerative graft reported that regenerative extracellular matrix graft attenuated the negative impact of polypropylene on the vagina [47] . However, despite promising, mainly comparative studies in animals no randomized trial in humans has been initiated so far to compare any of those coating strategies to non-coated meshes.Besides in vitro and in vivo data, the method has already proven feasible in a pilot study with 20 patients, thereby diminishing safety concerns [21] . In addition, our group has already developed and successfully implemented a long-term register for meshes and mesh modifications [22] . Thus, according to IDEAL, the method needs to be assessed, most preferably in an RCT setting. Another strength is that this trial can be easily randomized and single-blinded to the patient. Previous data show that there is no increased risk when applying meshes which have been previously coated with autologous plasma.This study protocol has limitations. An important limitation is the high number of required patients (n = 214 not including calculated lost to follow-up patients) per randomization arm which is necessary to prove (or not) the main outcome goal of decreased mesh-related complications when using plasma-coated meshes. As this study is bicentric in nature and although both centers are high-volume institutions, recruiting 428 or even 504 POP patients over 4 years is likely to be very difficult. A statistical advantage can only be shown given this data. Therefore, trial conclusion could be difficult recruiting-wise as the number of calculated patients is high. However, inclusion of additional centers by amendment is possible according to the protocol. An important dilemma of RCT in surgical innovations becomes visible: practicability may be unrealistic when statistical advantages are the only criteria to assess a surgical innovation. The IDEAL recommendations are aware of this difficult situation and provide alternative designs to fulfill stage 3 requirements (observational studies, interrupted time series) [48] . However, when evaluating the technique of plasma coating of meshes an RCT is technically feasible as described.Another limiting factor for the success of this trial is the challenge of finding appropriate funding sources or even financial supporters for an RCT with a modification of an already approved medical product. However, after successful publication of an approved trial protocol, institution funds and public funds will be targeted.One can imagine that this trial could show problems with regard to recruitment or funding. However, in this particular project it is of outmost importance that all IDEAL stages are covered and published accordingly. Thus, it assures awareness of necessary completion of all IDEAL stages for the surgical innovation of autologous plasma coating of meshes in order to evaluate its potential in broad clinical application.", "citance": "Chapman and colleagues reported that one in five surgical randomized controlled trials (RCT) are discontinued early, and one in three will not be published 2 years after trial conclusion [35] .", "claims": [{"text": "One in five surgical randomized controlled trials are discontinued early.

The first step of these processes is to check for errors. The aim of our study was to look for the presence of objective errors in consecutive articles published on three of the most authoritative clinical journals. Two reviewers evaluated the presence of any error in 200 consecutive original articles containing at least two tables, allowing a reanalysis of the data, published between October 2010 and April 2011. Error was considered any action different from what was planned. Errors were listed as: methodological, numerical and slips. They were considered as severe if numbers in the abstract were completely different from numbers reported in the full text. Among the 125 articles included in the study, 102 (82 %, 95 % CI 74\u201388 %) contained some kind of error, even multiple. Nine articles (7 %, 95 % CI 3\u201313 %) contained one slip, 92 articles (74 %, 95 % CI 65\u201381 %) contained at least one numerical error, and 22 articles (18 %, 95 % CI 11\u201325 %) contained one methodological error. Five articles (4 %, 95 % CI 1\u20139 %) contained one serious error. None of the errors retrieved (0 %, 95 % CI 0\u20132 %) would have changed the results of the studies. Most of the articles published in the most important medical journals present mistakes. Our results could be a clue to editorial and peer review systems system weaknesses. A debate within the scientific medical community about these systems, and possible alternative adjustments are needed.", "citation_paragraph": "Most of the articles published on the most important medical journals contain errors. None of the errors retrieved would have changed the conclusions of the studies.Most of the errors were numerical: wrong sums, wrong percentage, missing patients without explanations and 18 % contained at least one methodological error. The errors we retrieved could be considered as minor errors or near-miss, but we decided to count as error something that would not be subjectively evaluated. In this regard, we did not consider as error those articles in which a surrogate end point was chosen, or in which we did not agree with the design of the study.More significant items such as study design, outcome definition and bias are excluded from our definition of ''errors''. These latter errors would notoriously affect studies' results and validity more than ones we retrieved. Our decision was based on the fact that while the interpretation of the most relevant items such as outcome definition and study design could be a subject of discussion, the presence of errors as we defined them is absolutely objective. The aim of our work is not to estimate the possible consequences on study results of errors found, but to analyze the frailty of the review system, as a filter with larger pores.On this line of reasoning, our errors can be considered as ''near misses'' and not as adverse events.Moreover, it would be also interesting to note how the results of the studies have been presented. For example, we did not assess the presence of the 95 % CI of the point estimate or the use of likelihood ratios and sensitivity/ specificity instead of predictive values, since these topics were not the aim of the present study, and would need a more detailed analysis.Most of the articles published in the most authoritative medical journals relate to therapy, and only a few are about diagnosis (4 % in our analysis). One explanation may rely on economic issues. Indeed, most of the articles are supported by a sponsor that in most cases is a private institution, and in a quarter of the cases, analyze the data by itself. The disclosure of conflict of interest is mandatory in all the journals that we analyzed, but such a disclosure may not be enough to guarantee the reader of the reliability of the data. We should reflect on the fact that more than half of the articles published in the journals that most influence clinical practice are sponsored.''To err is human'' is the title of the report of the Institute of Medicine on medical errors [1] . We think that this concept may also apply to the editorial and peer-review processes.Most of the errors we retrieved could be considered as near-miss, an error potentially harmful but practically without consequences. However, we think that the presence of errors may represent a warning signal. Indeed, their presence may reveal that other more relevant errors may be skipped by the editorial and review processes, with some unknown consequences. The first step to deal with errors is to discuss them. This attitude has been present in the clinical setting for many years. Indeed clinicians perform audits to discuss clinical cases, and learn from their own errors. Thus, while from this point of view, clinical practice provides a robust tool for self education, the scientific editorial systems need to start it.Medical practice should be evidence based. The reliability of scientific evidence is sometimes threatened by factors extrinsic to the peer-review system. These factors may stem from unintentional bias and mistakes not detected by the peer reviewers, to the extreme instances of elaborate fraud [2, 3] . Publication bias is a recognized confounder in finding evidence, and in many areas, conflicts of interest have driven scientific recommendations [4, 5] . The peer-review process has many already known limits: Godlee et al. [6] find that only 25 % of the weakness present in articles has been found by the reviewer. We do not know if the presence of the errors we have found is linked to a less trustable article, more studies are needed to resolve this question, but finding such a number of errors in articles is absolutely unexpected, and we think that to provide more robust editorial and peer-review systems an open discussion of the errors, their significance and the way to reduce such errors is mandatory.Of course our study suffers from some limitations. We concentrated our analysis on articles consecutively published by the three most relevant medical journals over a period of 7 months. First, we analyzed the most popular journals because, in consideration of the high rejection rate of articles submitted every year, we expected that these journals would be the most controlled in the editorial and peer-review processes. According to the limited number of journals and articles considered, the results of our study could have a limited external validity. Second, we considered as errors only those that would not be subjective, thus we did not evaluate more methodologically relevant but less objective errors, as our aim was to detect system frailty not the consequences of errors. Third, the errors we retrieved could be underestimated because we did not take into account subjective errors, and in case of discordance between the two reviewers, the error was dismissed. Finally and most important, the finding of so many errors does not imply that the results of the studies are not robust and trustable.In conclusion, most of the articles published in the most important medical journals present mistakes. None of the errors retrieved would have changed the results of the studies. Our results could be a clue for editorial and peerreview systems' weakness. It is possible that the editorial and peer-review processes focus on the most important errors allowing the less important ones, however, it was sufficient that two young doctors examined the papers for errors and found most of them. Introducing a second control in the publication process would probably strengthen the system, without increasing the costs. A debate within the scientific medical community about these systems, and possible alternative adjustments of the peer-review process is needed.", "citance": "The peer-review process has many already known limits: Godlee et al.

This restoration of social independence was caused by a single mutation of large effect that confers fitness superiority over both ancestral genotypes, including immunity from exploitation by the ancestral cheater. Thus, a temporary state of obligate cheating served as an evolutionary stepping-stone to a novel state of autonomous social dominance.Obligate relationships are common in biology. Higher eukaryotes host a vast array of obligate parasites and mutualists that include both microbes and larger organisms [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . For example, numerous bacteria are obligate pathogens or symbionts 7, 8 , many bird species are obligate brood parasites 9 and a variety of insects are social parasites that rely on workers of another species to raise their offspring [10] [11] [12] [13] . These radically distinct obligate systems share the common theme of dependence on a host or partner (which might be of the same or of a different species) for evolutionary success despite their divergent mechanisms and strategies.At least in microbes, extensive gene inactivation or loss often occurs during long-term evolution in an obligate state of mutualism or parasitism 7, 8 , making reversion to free-living status highly unlikely after extended periods of evolution. Although these and other longterm patterns of coevolution in obligate systems have been detected 9, 14, 15 , little is known about the initial stages of obligation in any system 16 . It remains unclear how frequently genetic transitions to obligate status are contingently irreversible 17 or rather might reverse during early stages of obligate coevolution, either directly to the exact ancestral genotype or by a novel mutational pathway 18, 19 . In particular, little is known about the potential of obligate social cheaters to evolve new forms of social cooperation that do not depend on the prior social host.Myxococcus xanthus is the best characterized species of the soildwelling myxobacteria, which are distinguished by cooperative predation on other microbes and social development into a wide variety of fruiting body morphologies 20 . Predation is accomplished by swarming packs of cells that secrete toxic and lytic metabolites that kill and degrade prey organisms and thereby generate an extracellular, public pool of resources 21 . Both predation and development are facilitated by two motility systems, one of which is social in nature and employs type-IV pili that mediate cell-cell interactions 22 . Upon amino-acid deprivation, M. xanthus cells aggregate into local groups of ,100,000 individuals that exchange intercellular signals to construct spore-bearing fruiting bodies 23 . Importantly, only a minority of cells survive development after differentiation into stress-resistant spores 24 , and thus proficiency at competition for limited sporulation 'slots' can be a major fitness component for distinct genotypes undergoing co-development in chimaeric fruiting bodies 25, 26 . This microbial system (as well as others 27, 28 ) readily allows real-time observation of evolutionary changes in social traits 29, 30 . A variety of socially exploitative relationships among microbes have been described 25, 26, [31] [32] [33] [34] , including developmentally-defective genotypes of M. xanthus that are capable of cheating on their developmentally-proficient progenitor during starvation 26, 35 . Several such cheaters were isolated from M. xanthus populations that had undergone 1,000 generations of evolution in nutrient-rich liquid medium in which positive selection for proficient motility or development was absent 26, 30 . Under these conditions all populations incurred major evolutionary losses in social ability, with most lineages becoming defective in both social motility and developmental sporulation.In mixtures with the developmentally proficient ancestor, however, some of these developmentally incompetent genotypes are able to cheat on their social benefactor by sporulating even more efficiently than the ancestral cooperator 26, 35 . One such cheater genotype, here designated 'OC' (Obligate Cheater), fails to produce viable spores in clonal isolation 35 . In this experimental system, OC is thus an obligate social cheater that requires the presence of a developmentally proficient social host (for example, strain GJV2, a marked variant of OC's ancestor GJV1) to avoid extinction during starvation. GJV2 is altruistic in an evolutionary sense because it benefits the fitness of OC to its own competitive disadvantage.", "citance": "Importantly, only a minority of cells survive development after differentiation into stress-resistant spores 24 , and thus proficiency at competition for limited sporulation 'slots' can be a major fitness component for distinct genotypes undergoing co-development in chimaeric fruiting bodies 25, 26 .", "claims": [{"text": "Only a minority of cells survive development after differentiation into stress-resistant spores.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Use of geocoded electronic health record (EHR) data to prevent spread of disease is limited in health service research. We demonstrate how geocoded EHR and spatial analyses can be used to identify risks for CA-MRSA in children, which are tied to place-based determinants and would not be uncovered using traditional EHR data analyses.   METHODS An epidemiology study was conducted on children from January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2010 who were treated for Staphylococcus aureus infections. A generalized estimated equations (GEE) model was developed and crude and adjusted odds ratios were based on S. aureus risks. We measured the risk of S. aureus as standardized incidence ratios (SIR) calculated within aggregated US 2010 Census tracts called spatially adaptive filters, and then created maps that differentiate the geographic patterns of antibiotic resistant and non-resistant forms of S. aureus.   RESULTS CA-MRSA rates increased at higher rates compared to non-resistant forms, p = 0.01. Children with no or public health insurance had higher odds of CA-MRSA infection. Black children were almost 1.5 times as likely as white children to have CA-MRSA infections (aOR 95% CI 1.44,1.75, p < 0.0001); this finding persisted at the block group level (p < 0.001) along with household crowding (p < 0.001). The youngest category of age (< 4 years) also had increased risk for CA-MRSA (aOR 1.65, 95%CI 1.48, 1.83, p < 0.0001). CA-MRSA encompasses larger areas with higher SIRs compared to non-resistant forms and were found in block groups with higher proportion of blacks (r = 0.517, p < 0.001), younger age (r = 0.137, p < 0.001), and crowding (r = 0.320, p < 0.001).   CONCLUSIONS In the Atlanta MSA, the risk for CA-MRSA is associated with neighborhood-level measures of racial composition, household crowding, and age of children. Neighborhoods which have higher proportion of blacks, household crowding, and children < 4 years of age are at greatest risk. Understanding spatial relationship at a community level and how it relates to risks for antibiotic resistant infections is important to combat the growing numbers and spread of such infections like CA-MRSA.", "citation_paragraph": "The use of geocoded electronic health record (EHR) data for improving health outcomes is in its infancy [1] particularly for infectious diseases such as community-associated methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) infections [2] [3] [4] . This is an important disease to study because it is preventable and the number of children hospitalized with CA-MRSA infections in the United States increased from 6.7 cases per 1000 admissions in 2002 to 21.2 cases in 2007 [5] . We demonstrated how geocoded EHR data in conjunction with a geographic information system (GIS) can be used to enhance the geographic surveillance of CA-MRSA. In doing so, we 1) characterized the communities where children infected by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) resided during the height of the CA-MRSA epidemic in the US [6] (2002-2010); and 2) identified areas at high risk for CA-MRSA where targeted interventions aimed at preventing disease transmission will have potentially the most impact.Electronic health records are becoming a routine part of patient care. Their primary purpose is to follow the provision of care to individual patients. However, they are also a source of data for public health surveillance that cannot be obtained from reportable disease registries or vital statistics databases. EHR data typically includes basic demographic characteristics of the patient as well as their list of diagnoses, prescriptions, results from laboratory tests, referrals to specialists, and provider characteristics [7] . They also contain residential information about the patient which can be geocoded and linked to data about the patient's social, physical and built environment, community resources and other data about their community [8] . Use of geocoded EHR for public health is still emerging, but there are a wide range of recent application areas including hospital readmissions for pediatric asthma [9] , preventable emergency department visits [10, 11] , hospitalizations for common illnesses [12] , obesity in children [12] , and Type 2 diabetes [8, 13, 14] .Population based studies have shown a higher rate of invasive MRSA infections among blacks and other minorities [15] [16] [17] [18] and in densely populated areas with high numbers of pre-school and school aged children [19] . The subset of MRSA infections emerging from the community, or CA-MRSA infections, have been endemic in many urban areas with significantly increased risk for invasive infection among blacks [6, 17, 20] . Risks associated with CA-MRSA disease may also be related to socioeconomic factors [4, 21] , and are not well characterized for this community acquired infection [6, 16, 17] . For instance, household crowding has been cited as a risk for CA-MRSA infections, but the impact of neighborhood crowding has not previously been addressed [22, 23] .The goals of this study are to characterize the neighborhoods with the highest rates of CA-MRSA infection in the Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Roswell, GA Metropolitan Statistical Area (the Atlanta MSA), and to analyze the spatial distribution of CA-MRSA compared to the non-antibiotic resistant form of S. aureus, also known as community-associated methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MSSA). There are very few studies to characterize CA-MRSA infections in this region of the US, compared to other parts. This spatial characterization would enable us to identify specific areas at greatest risk for antibiotic resistance and thus, identify those communities most likely to benefit from targeted interventions. Comparing spatial patterns of the nonresistant forms of S. aureus to resistant forms would identify clonal spread of specific resistant strains which may be circulating in a community or neighborhood; primary and secondary intervention plans aimed at specific geographic areas could be tailored, based on the risks associated with a particular location. For example, CA-MRSA rates within certain communities [24] have decreased over the last 5 years when community-level prevention measures (e.g., increased hand sanitizers located throughout public areas) were implemented. The importance of achieving these goals would allow public health officials and area primary care providers to combat the spread of CA-MRSA infections through targeted interventions aimed at those communities at highest risk for acquisition and transmission. Such interventions would contribute to the development of health policy guidelines for infection control, effective home and school-based interventions, and identifying but not stigmatizing children who may be at increased risk for CA-MRSA based on individual and area level risk factors.", "citance": "For example, CA-MRSA rates within certain communities [24] have decreased over the last 5 years when community-level prevention measures (e.g., increased hand sanitizers located throughout public areas) were implemented.", "claims": [{"text": "Over a 5 year period, community-associated methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) rates decreased when community-level prevention measures were implemented. \n", "subject": "(CA-MRSA) rates", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Over a 5 year period, community-associated methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) rates remained unchanged despite the implementation of community-level prevention measures.", "subject": "(CA-MRSA) rates", "is_negation": true}]}
{"s2orc_id": 475805, "title": "The CENP-A N-Tail Confers Epigenetic Stability to Centromeres via the CENP-T Branch of the CCAN in Fission Yeast", "abstract": "In most eukaryotes, centromeres are defined epigenetically by presence of the histone H3 variant CENP-A [1-3]. CENP-A-containing chromatin recruits the constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN) of proteins, which in turn directs assembly of the outer kinetochore to form microtubule attachments and ensure chromosome segregation fidelity [4-6]. Whereas the mechanisms that load CENP-A at centromeres are being elucidated, the functions of its divergent N-terminal tail remain enigmatic [7-12]. Here, we employ the well-studied fission yeast centromere [13-16] to investigate the function of the CENP-A (Cnp1) N-tail. We show that alteration of the N-tail does not affect Cnp1 loading at centromeres, outer kinetochore formation, or spindle checkpoint signaling but nevertheless elevates chromosome loss. N-tail mutants exhibited synthetic lethality with an altered centromeric DNA sequence, with rare survivors harboring chromosomal fusions in which the altered centromere was epigenetically inactivated. Elevated centromere inactivation was also observed for N-tail mutants with unaltered centromeric DNA sequences. N-tail mutants specifically reduced localization of the CCAN proteins Cnp20/CENP-T and Mis6/CENP-I, but not Cnp3/CENP-C. Overexpression of Cnp20/CENP-T suppressed defects in an N-tail mutant, suggesting a link between reduced CENP-T recruitment and the observed centromere inactivation phenotype. Thus, the Cnp1 N-tail promotes epigenetic stability of centromeres in fission yeast, at least in part via recruitment of the CENP-T branch of the CCAN.", "citation_paragraph": "One explanation for the missegregation defect caused by alterations in the Cnp1 N-tail is a reduction in loading at centromeres. To test this possibility, we quantified the fluorescence at clustered centromeres of GFP-Cnp1, GFP-Halftail, and GFP-Tailswap in a cnp1D background. Both GFP-Halftail and GFP-Tailswap localized equivalently to GFP-Cnp1 at centromeres ( Figures 1F and S1E ). In addition, equivalent localization was observed for GFP-Cnp1 and N-tail variants, with the exception of Deltatail, in the presence of endogenous Cnp1 ( Figure S1F ). Consistent with their normal loading, overexpression of all Cnp1 N-tail variants rescued the temperature-sensitive growth defect of scm3-139 ( Figure S1G ), which is caused by perturbation of the interaction between Cnp1 and its specialized chaperone Scm3 [20] . These results suggest that the elevated chromosome missegregation observed in the N-tail variants is not due to a defect in Cnp1 loading.We next tested outer kinetochore assembly in the Cnp1 N-tail variants. First, we quantified centromere localization of the Ndc80 subunit of the conserved Ndc80 complex that directly mediates end-coupled microtubule attachments (legend continued on next page) [21, 22] . Ndc80 localization was unaffected in all tested N-tail Cnp1 variants ( Figure 1G ). Second, we monitored spindle checkpoint activity, which requires an intact outer kinetochore to generate a signal that prevents cell-cycle progression [23] . Analysis of the checkpoint-mediated arrest, performed using a cold-sensitive tubulin mutation to disrupt microtubules [24] , revealed normal arrest in Cnp1 N-tail variants ( Figure 1H ); in contrast, the checkpoint pathway mutant mad1D failed to arrest. Thus, Cnp1 N-tail variants cause significant chromosome segregation defects, but these do not appear to arise from a problem in loading Cnp1 at centromeres or building an outer kinetochore with normal Ndc80 recruitment and checkpoint-signaling activity.Cnp1 Tail Variants Exhibit Synthetic Lethality in the Presence of an Altered Central Core Sequence A clue as to the origin of the Cnp1 N-tail variant missegregation defect came from a serendipitous observation made while introducing N-tail variants into strains harboring operator array insertions. Whereas we were able to construct strains expressing N-tail variants in a cnp1D background with operator array insertions outside the central core of the centromere (e.g., Figure 1E ; Cnp1 is concentrated in the central core) [20, 25] , we were unable to obtain strains with a TetO array insertion in the central core ( Figure 2A ; the strain also expresses a TetR-tomato fusion to label the array and is referred to as cen2-tetO-tomato) [26] .To assess if the N-tail variants and cen2-tetO-tomato were synthetic lethal, we used the mating-based random sporulation assay schematized in Figure 2A . In this assay, synthetic lethality is measured by the ratio of the number of colonies at 36 C (which prevents growth of cnp1D spores that inherited the cnp1-1 ts mutant transgene integrated at the lys1 locus) versus 25 C (where cnp1D spores that inherit either the cnp1-1 ts mutant or a gfp-cnp1 N-tail transgene integrated in the lys1 locus form colonies). In the absence of a central core TetO array insertion and with a gfp-cnp1+ transgene, the ratio was w0.4, near the expected ratio of 0.5. The cen2-tetO-tomato insertion in combination with gfp-cnp1+ reduced this ratio to w0.2, indicating a mild synthetic defect. The gfptailswap transgene in the absence of a TetO insertion exhibited a ratio of 0.23. Strikingly, for the combination of gfp-tailswap and the TetO insertion, the ratio was <0.01, indicating strong synthetic lethality. Similar magnitude synthetic lethality was observed with cen2-tetO-tomato and gfp-halftail and gfpquartertail transgenes (Figure 2A ). Importantly, neither cnp1-1 ts (Figures 2B and S2A) nor clr4D ( Figure 2C ), which exhibits similar magnitude chromosome missegregation as the N-tail variants ( Figure 1D ), exhibited synthetic lethality with cen2-tetO-tomato. In addition, the observed synthetic lethality is not due to temperature sensitivity, as it was also observed in plasmid shuffle assays performed at 30 C ( Figure 2C ). Finally, synthetic lethality was not observed when N-tail variants were combined with an operator array integrated outside the central core ( Figure S2B ; Table S1 ). Thus, N-tail variants of Cnp1 exhibit strong synthetic lethality with a centromeric DNA sequence harboring an operator array insertion in the central core.", "citance": "Consistent with their normal loading, overexpression of all Cnp1 N-tail variants rescued the temperature-sensitive growth defect of scm3-139 ( Figure S1G ), which is caused by perturbation of the interaction between Cnp1 and its specialized chaperone Scm3 [20] .", "claims": [{"text": "Overexpressing Cnp1 N-tail variants exacerbates the temperature-sensitive growth defect of scm3-139.", "subject": "rescue of scm3-139 growth defect", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Overexpressing Cnp1 N-tail variants rescues the temperature-sensitive growth defect of scm3-139.", "subject": "rescue of scm3-139 growth defect", "is_negation": false}]}

ABSTRACT OPA1 is a GTPase that controls several functions, such as mitochondrial dynamics and energetics, mtDNA maintenance and cristae integrity. In the last years, there have been described other cellular pathways and mechanisms involving OPA1 directly or through its interaction. All this new information, by implementing our knowledge on OPA1 is instrumental to elucidating the pathogenic mechanisms of OPA1 mutations. Indeed, these are associated with dominant optic atrophy (DOA), one of the most common inherited optic neuropathies, and with an increasing number of heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders. In this review, we overview all recent findings on OPA1 protein functions, on its dysfunction and related clinical phenotypes, focusing on the current therapeutic options and future perspectives to treat DOA and the other associated neurological disorders due to OPA1 mutations.", "citation_paragraph": "The respiratory chain constitutes the main source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within the cell. Considering the role of OPA1 in supercomplexes organization and shaping cristae structure, it is predictable that OPA1 dysfunction may imply ROS over-production and unbalanced redox homeostasis. Indeed, increased ROS levels were reported in a Drosophila model with homozygous or heterozygous mutations of Opa1 [66, 67] and in cardiomyocytes from a Opa1 +/\u2212 mouse models [68] . Furthermore, in brain cortex from Opa1 +/\u2212 transgenic mouse, as well as in OPA1 down-regulated cortical neurons, a reduction of aconitase activity was reported, strongly supporting an unbalance in redox homeostasis. This is also confirmed by activation of the nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2 like 2 (NRF2) pathway, leading to increased levels of mitochondrial antioxidant defenses (i.e. superoxide dismutases 1 and 2, SOD1 and SOD2) [69] . Increased ROS leves were also observed in lymphoblastoid cells bearing OPA1 mutations [70] and altered levels of antioxidant enzumes were revealed in fibroblasts from patients with DOA, further supporting a perturbation of mitochondrial redox state [69] . Conversely, overexpression of OPA1 reduced mitochondrial ROS production by stabilizing supercomplexes [71] . Finally, a mutual relationship between OPA1 and ROS has been recently highlighted in cardiomyocytes, where increased ROS generation caused by overexpressing long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 1 (ACSL1) altered the proteolytic processing of OPA1 [72] .", "citance": "Conversely, overexpression of OPA1 reduced mitochondrial ROS production by stabilizing supercomplexes [71] .", "claims": [{"text": "Overexpression of OPA1 reduces mitochondrial ROS production by destabilizing supercomplexes.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Overexpression of OPA1 reduces mitochondrial ROS production by stabilizing supercomplexes.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Therefore, these data suggest a crucial role for STING in suppressing colorectal tumorigenesis in colitis-associated CRC. We observed that STING gt/gt mice lost significantly more body weight than did WT mice ( Fig. 2A) . Indeed, the colon length was greatly reduced in STING gt/gt mice on day 14 (Fig. 2B) . H&E staining revealed an increase in cellular infiltration, crypt thickness, and hyperchromatin in colon tissues of STING gt/gt mice on day 14 (Fig. 2C) . In agreement, all of the histologic parameters assessed-inflammation, ulceration, and hyperplasia-were significantly higher in STING gt/gt mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 2D, 2E ). To assess whether STING mediates neoplastic changes that predispose the host to increased tumorigenic events, we performed Ki-67 staining on colon tissue sections and quantified the magnitude of intestinal epithelial proliferation. In line with our histological analysis, the colon of STING gt/gt mice had significantly increased numbers of Ki-67 + cells/crypt (58.7 6 2.1; n = 137) compared with WT mice (39.6 6 1.3; n = 153; p , 0.0001) on day 14 (Fig. 2F) . Taken together, these results suggest that STING plays an important function in controlling disease initiation and susceptibility to hyperproliferation during early stages of colitis-associated CRC.Because inflammation is one of the most important drivers in the development of CRC (3), we hypothesized that STING controls inflammation during early stages of AOM-DSS treatment, which ultimately determines host susceptibility to colorectal tumorigenesis. To analyze the magnitude of colonic inflammation in STING gt/gt mice, we measured levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and KC on day 14 (in the absence of any tumors) and day 80 (when tumors were fully developed). At 14 d post-AOM injection, we observed a significant increase in the levels of IL-6 and KC in colon tissues of STING gt/gt mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 3A) . We confirmed this finding and observed elevated levels of circulating IL-6 and KC in the serum of STING gt/gt mice (Fig. 3B) . Consistently, we found elevated phosphorylation of ERK and IkBa in colon tissues of STING gt/gt mice compared with WT mice on day 14 (Fig. 3C) . On day 80, when tumors were fully developed, the levels of IL-6 and KC remained elevated in STING gt/gt mice (Supplemental Fig. 1C ). Previous reports showed that myeloid cell-derived IL-6 signals through IL-6R and gp130 to activate cytoplasmic STAT3 in intestinal epithelial cells (24, 25) . STAT3 is frequently activated in premalignant and cancer cells to promote colon tumorigenesis by amplifying inflammation and tumorigenic transformation (26) . Indeed, colon tissues from STING gt/gt mice showed increased STAT3 phosphorylation compared with WT mice , n = 5. Data are mean 6 SEM of two independent experiments. **p , 0.01, ***p , 0.001, ****p , 0.0001. (Fig. 3D) . We also measured type I IFN production 14 d post-AOM injection and detected only basal levels of IFN-b in WT or STING gt/gt mice (Supplemental Fig. 2A ). Caspase-1-mediated release of IL-18 was shown to play a protective role in AOM-DSS-induced colorectal tumorigenesis (16) . We found reduced levels of caspase-1 activation and IL-18 release in colon tissues of STING gt/gt mice compared with WT mice after 14 d (Supplemental Fig. 2B, 2C ). Therefore, it is possible that the cross-talk between STING and caspase-1 could mediate protection at the intestinal barrier. These findings highlight that STING restricts NF-kB-and STAT3-signaling pathways to control colon inflammation and tumorigenesis.The gut microbiota plays a critical role in modulating susceptibility to CRC. Dysbiosis is associated with increased susceptibility to colitis and CRC development (3). To investigate whether an altered gut microbiota profile contributed to the elevated incidence of colorectal tumorigenesis in STING gt/gt mice, we performed real-time quantitative PCR analysis to detect the abundance of five major intestinal bacterial populations. We found that WT and STING gt/gt mice harbored similar levels of Prevotellaceae, Bacteroides, MIB, SFB, and TM7 (Supplemental Fig. 2D-H) . Therefore, it is unlikely that differences in these bacterial populations contributed to the protective role of STING during CRC development.A recent study revealed that administration of multiple doses of the STING ligand cyclic di-GMP, alone or in combination with an adjuvant, reduced the number of metastases, tumor weight, and tumor size in a mouse model of metastatic breast tumor (27) . The ability of cyclic di-GMP to enhance T cell responses, amplify IL-12 production by myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and activate caspase-3-dependent cell death in tumor cells was reported to play a role in reducing metastatic breast cancer (27) . The antitumorigenic properties of cyclic di-GMP in breast cancer indicate a need to evaluate the therapeutic value of this STING ligand in CRC. It is possible that STING itself, or in concert with an upstream DNA sensor, recognizes endogenous DNA released by dying cells during intestinal barrier damage. In addition, oxidative DNA damage was shown to accumulate in intestinal epithelial cells and activate STING signaling (28, 29) . It is possible that recognition of endogenous DNA by STING mediates suppression of inflammation, which reduces the likelihood of uncontrolled inflammation leading to tumorigenesis. Overall, our results underscore a novel role for STING in modulating activation of NF-kB and STAT3 signaling and production of IL-18 during the development of CRC. These inflammatory mediators may modulate the tumorigenic properties of intestinal cells, which ultimately regulate proliferation and tumorigenesis. Collectively, our data indicate that STING plays a critical role in mediating protection against inflammation-associated CRC development. Therapeutic modulation of STING in susceptible individuals may have the potential to prevent and treat CRC.", "citance": "In addition, oxidative DNA damage was shown to accumulate in intestinal epithelial cells and activate STING signaling (28, 29) .", "claims": [{"text": "Oxidative DNA damage activates STING signalling.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Oxidative DNA damage inhibits STING signalling.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}
{"s2orc_id": 195760089, "title": "DNA damage tolerance in stem cells, ageing, mutagenesis, disease and cancer therapy", "abstract": "The DNA damage response network guards the stability of the genome from a plethora of exogenous and endogenous insults. An essential feature of the DNA damage response network is its capacity to tolerate DNA damage and structural impediments during DNA synthesis. This capacity, referred to as DNA damage tolerance (DDT), contributes to replication fork progression and stability in the presence of blocking structures or DNA lesions. Defective DDT can lead to a prolonged fork arrest and eventually cumulate in a fork collapse that involves the formation of DNA double strand breaks. Four principal modes of DDT have been distinguished: translesion synthesis, fork reversal, template switching and repriming. All DDT modes warrant continuation of replication through bypassing the fork stalling impediment or repriming downstream of the impediment in combination with filling of the single-stranded DNA gaps. In this way, DDT prevents secondary DNA damage and critically contributes to genome stability and cellular fitness. DDT plays a key role in mutagenesis, stem cell maintenance, ageing and the prevention of cancer. This review provides an overview of the role of DDT in these aspects.", "citation_paragraph": "During fork reversal, the replication fork regresses from a fork into a chicken foot-like DNA structure (72) (Figure 3 ). In the chicken foot structure, the replication machinery has the opportunity to use the newly synthesized strand of the intact sister chromatid as alternative to the damaged template. Though it has not been proven directly that fork reversal promotes damage bypass, it is an attractive model for the function of the fork reversal as fork reversal gives nascent DNA of the stalled strand direct access to the nascent homologues undamaged template. Alternatively, fork reversal may occur to stabilize the stalled fork (22). PCNA-Ub n formation facilitates fork reversal and E2 ubiquitin ligase UBC13 is needed to generate a K63-linked polyubiquitin moiety at PCNA K164 (69) . Translocase zinc finger RANBP2-type containing 3 (ZRANB3) binds PCNA-Ub n and remodels the replication fork to a reversed fork and is involved in D-loop dissociation (69, (74) (75) (76) . Another translocase, SWI/SNF related, matrix associated, actin dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a like 1 (SMARCAL1) is also involved in promoting fork reversal (75, 77) . SMARCAL1 can evict RPA from the DNA and reanneal complementary single-stranded DNAs (78) (79) (80) . In this manner, SMARCAL1 is involved in reversing stalled replication forks. Furthermore, SMARCAL1 phosphorylation by ATR prevents nuclease-mediated fork collapse (81) . The phosphorylation of SMARCAL1 by ATR limits fork regression by SMARLCAL1. Other factors that are involved in fork reversal are the homologous recombination proteins BRCA2 and RAD51. These factors protect the fork form Meiotic Recombination 11 Homologue 1 (MRE-11) exonuclease activity (82) (83) (84) . When forks are reversed, these structures need to be protected from MRE-11 exonuclease activity. Without protection of the reversed fork, MRE-11 degrades the newly synthesized DNA of the leading and lagging strand from 3 to 5 and 5 to 3 , respectively (85) . As in vitro MRE-11 only has a 3 -5 resection activity, the 5 to 3 degradation of the lagging strand may involve another exonuclease whose activity depends on MRE-11 (86) . In addition, RecQ like helicase (RECQL), DNA replication helicase/nuclease 2 (DNA2) and Werner syndrome RecQ like helicase (WRN) helicases are involved in promoting replication fork restart during fork reversal (22). Another report in human cells suggest that RECQL limits DNA2-and WRN-mediated degradation of the reversed fork to create the 3 overhang in the reversed fork (87) . Furthermore, PARP1 is involved in promoting fork reversal, as shown in topoisomerase inhibitor induced fork reversal (88) . In addition, helicase FANCM has been implicated in fork reversal in promoting branch migration, as shown using purified FANCM (89, 90) . This observation has been corroborated independently in fission yeast, where FANCM orthologue Fml1 promotes fork reversal (91).", "citance": "PCNA-Ub n formation facilitates fork reversal and E2 ubiquitin ligase UBC13 is needed to generate a K63-linked polyubiquitin moiety at PCNA K164 (69) .", "claims": [{"text": "PCNA-Ub n formation causes fork reversal.", "subject": "PCNA-Ub n formation", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Ubiquitin ligase UBC13 generates a K63-linked polyubiquitin moiety at PCNA K164.", "subject": "Ubiquitin ligase UBC13 ", "is_negation": false}]}

PGE2 exerts diverse effects on cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, inflammation, and immune surveillance. This review concentrates primarily on gastrointestinal cancers, where the actions of PGE2 are most prominent, most likely due to the constant exposure to dietary and environmental insults and the intrinsic role of PGE2 in tissue homeostasis. A discussion of recent efforts to elucidate the complex and interconnected pathways that link PGE2 signaling with inflammation and cancer is provided, supported by the abundant literature showing a protective effect of NSAIDs and the therapeutic efficacy of targeting mPGES-1 or EP receptors for cancer prevention. However, suppressing PGE2 formation as a means of providing chemoprotection against all cancers may not ultimately be tenable, undoubtedly the situation for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Future studies to fully understand the complex role of PGE2 in both inflammation and cancer will be required to develop novel strategies for cancer prevention that are both effective and safe.", "citation_paragraph": "In combination with stimulation of PGE 2 formation, EP receptors are aberrantly expressed in multiple GI cancers. In CRC, for example, EP4 is the most abundantly expressed subtype of the EP receptors, and its levels are often upregulated during colon carcinogenesis. This was initially shown experimentally in mice by Mutoh et al. [85] and then in human colon cancer cell lines by Chell et al. [86] and later confirmed [87] . As recently demonstrated by Chandramouli et al. [88] , EP4 is negatively regulated in human cancer cells by miR-101, a microRNA that also inhibits COX-2 expression, raising the possibility that EP4 may ultimately provide a viable chemoprevention target. To assess the functional role of the specific EP receptor subtypes in intestinal cancer, a series of studies using genetic mouse models were performed more than a decade ago. In the first study of its kind, Watanabe et al. [89] examined the role of EP1 and EP3 in colon carcinogenesis. The formation of carcinogen-induced colonic aberrant crypt foci (ACF) was reduced by~60 %, an effect that occurred only in the EP1 KO mice. On the other hand, the EP3 receptor may play an important role in later stages of colon carcinogenesis. As observed by Shoji et al. [90] , EP3 expression was significantly reduced within the AOM-induced tumors, and there was an increase in tumor incidence and multiplicity in EP3-deficient mice. Interestingly, treatment of colon cancer cells with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) restored EP3 receptor expression, providing evidence that aberrant DNA methylation may contribute to the down-regulation of EP3 expression in colon cancer cells [90] . In line with this observation, Xia et al. [91] have recently demonstrated in both in vitro and in vivo models that PGE 2 promotes intestinal tumor growth by altering the expression of certain tumor-suppressor and DNA repair genes via epigenetic silencing. Exact mechanisms by which PGE 2 affects DNA methylation must be further addressed in future studies.In an important study by the Taketo laboratory [92] , additional proof for the key role of the EP2 receptor in small intestinal tumorigenesis was obtained. Homozygous deletion of the EP2 receptor in Apc \u0394716 compound mutant mice resulted in significant protection against intestinal cancer (tumor size and numbers), an effect that partially phenocopied the COX-2 KO mouse model. Genetic deletion of EP1 and EP3 were only slightly protective, whereas perhaps surprisingly, no protection was afforded to the intestine by the genetic deletion of the EP4 receptor. It was further proposed that increased cellular cAMP levels involving PGE 2 -EP2 receptor signaling amplified the actions of COX-2, possibly activating the expression of VEGF within the tumor microenvironment. Finally, the Wakabayashi laboratory [85] further assessed the role of the prostanoid receptors in colon carcinogenesis using six KO mouse lines (EP2, EP4, DP, FP, IP, and TP). After treatment with AOM, ACF formation was suppressed only in the EP4 KO mice to levels that were 56 % of wild-type controls. The lack of protection afforded by genetic deletion of the EP2 receptor was surprising, based on the previous findings in Apc \u0394716 mice. This may be a result of tissuespecific actions of the EP receptors within different regions of the intestinal epithelium or perhaps underlying differences in the initiating events that drive cancer in these two mouse models. Several recent studies have addressed the potential role of the COX-2-PGE 2 -EP signaling axis in other GI cancers. A recent study by Jimenez et al. [93] examined human esophageal cancers and found elevated levels of COX-2 and EP2 during the course of disease progression from Barrett's metaplasia to intraepithelial neoplasia, and finally to adenocarcinoma formation. While the expression of the EP4 receptor was increased in esophageal adenocarcinomas, the expression levels of COX-1 and the EP3 receptor were actually decreased during disease progression. In a liver cancer cell line (HepG2), treatment with the EP1 receptor agonist, ONO-DI-004, increased their viability and migration [94] . This effect was reversed by the EP1 receptor antagonist, ONO-8711, as well as by treatment with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), suggesting a novel mechanism for the chemopreventive efficacy of EGCG within the context of PGE 2 signaling. It is important to note that EP receptors exhibit highly tissue-specific functional activities. For example, EP3 has been shown to induce matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells, suggesting its involvement in angiogenesis and tumor metastasis [95] .", "citance": "In line with this observation, Xia et al.

Tissue culture experiments have shown GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) to be targeted to the apical membrane of epithelial cells. However, the in vivo importance of this targeting has not been investigated since null mutations in GPI biosynthesis enzymes in mice result in very early embryonic lethality. Missense mutations in the human GPI biosynthesis enzyme pigv are associated with a multiple congenital malformation syndrome with a high frequency of Hirschsprung disease and renal anomalies. However, it is currently unknown how these phenotypes are linked to PIGV function. Here, we identify a temperature-sensitive hypomorphic allele of PIGV in Caenorhabditis elegans, pigv-1(qm34), enabling us to study the role of GPI-APs in development. At the restrictive temperature we found a 75% reduction in GPI-APs at the surface of embryonic cells. Consequently, ~80% of pigv-1(qm34) embryos arrested development during the elongation phase of morphogenesis, exhibiting internal cysts and/or surface ruptures. Closer examination of the defects revealed them all to be the result of breaches in epithelial tissues: cysts formed in the intestine and excretory canal, and ruptures occurred through epidermal cells, suggesting weakening of the epithelial membrane or membrane-cortex connection. Knockdown of piga-1, another GPI biosynthesis enzymes resulted in similar phenotypes. Importantly, fortifying the link between the apical membrane and actin cortex by overexpression of the ezrin/radixin/moesin ortholog ERM-1, significantly rescued cyst formation and ruptures in the pigv-1(qm34) mutant. In conclusion, we discovered GPI-APs play a critical role in maintaining the integrity of the epithelial tissues, allowing them to withstand the pressure and stresses of morphogenesis. Our findings may help to explain some of the phenotypes observed in human syndromes associated with pigv mutations.", "citation_paragraph": "GPI anchor is an important post-translational protein modification whose functions and mechanisms have been widely studied using unicellular organisms and mammalian cells in culture [1, 6, 9] . However, the role of GPI biosynthesis in animals remains poorly understood. In humans, somatic mutations in PIGA gene loci lead to paroxysmal nocturnal hemaglobinuria, a disease characterized by increased susceptibility of erythrocytes to lysis by the complement immune system [34] . No heritable mutation in piga gene in human has been identified, suggesting that PIGA function is required during embryogenesis. Indeed, deletion of PIGA gene in mice, which completely abrogates GPI biosynthesis, resulted in early embryogenesis defects [11, 35] . However, this condition precludes the study of GPI function throughout embryogenesis.Also in C. elegans, a null mutation in piga-1 results in germline defects and early embryonic lethality. In this study, we circumvented the early requirements for GPI-APs by using a temperature sensitive hypomorphic allele of pigv-1. The amount of GPI-APs remaining upon pigv-1 inactivation was sufficient for normal germline development, thus enabling us to uncover their requirement during embryogenesis. We showed that GPI-APs are present and function throughout embryogenesis. Interestingly, the phenotypes of pigv-1 inactivation, i.e., weakened epithelial tissues, are manifested only late in embryogenesis during the elongation stage of epidermal morphogenesis. This may be due to increased mechanical forces generated by actomyosin in muscle and epidermis tissues at that stage.Although present at the membrane of all cells in the C. elegans embryo, pigv-1 loss of function exhibits no defect in early development events, such as gastrulation or tissue differentiation. This is in contrast to mammalian embryogenesis, in which complete PIGA depletion results in defects in tissue differentiation [35] . One possible explanation for this difference is that the residual GPI-APs in pigv-1 animals are sufficient for normal differentiation. Another reason could be differences in the proteins regulating differentiation. Tissue differentiation in mammals is regulated by BMP/ TGF-\u03b2 signaling whose activation requires GPI-anchored coreceptors, Dragon and Cripto-1 [35, 36] . Although present in C. elegans, BMP/TGF-\u03b2 signaling is not required during embryogenesis, but operates during postembryonic development, regulating body size [37, 38] .Inactivation of pigv-1 in C. elegans embryos resulted mainly in epithelial defects. Failures in epidermal enclosure and intestinal cyst formation are consistent with weaker cell-cell adhesion. In the epidermis, improper cell-cell adhesion creates gaps between ventral epidermal cells from which internal tissues leak out during elongation. Compromised cell-cell junctions in the intestine, which has higher osmotic pressure than the surrounding tissues, would allow passage of low molecular weight substances, such as water molecules, from the intestinal lumen to the intestine basal side. The presence of a basal lamina separating the intestine from the pseudocoelom results in accumulation of these substances in the form of cysts.One possible explanation of these results is that the reduction in the amount of one or more specific cell adhesion proteins that are GPI-anchored causes the observed defects. However, amongst the GPI-APs that have been experimentally identified in C. elegans none are known to mediate cell-cell adhesion [7, 10] . While we do not rule out the involvement of yet unknown GPI-anchored adhesion proteins, we propose another mechanism to explain the observed epithelial phenotypes that does not depend on a specific protein, but rather on the GPI anchors themselves. Goswami et. al. have shown that cortical actin affects the organization of GPI-AP in the membrane [13] . We propose that GPI-APs are enriched in apical membranes of polarized epithelial cells where they play a role in organizing the membrane into domains that interact with the actin cortex within the cell and through these interactions stabilize the apical membrane. According to this model, a decrease in GPI-APs will lead to fewer membranecortex connections and thus to a weaker apical membrane. In support of this idea, we observed a widening of the intestinal lumen in pigv-1 mutant embryos, as would be expected if the apical membrane of the intestine is weakened and thereby cannot resist as well the osmotic pressure from inside the lumen. Further support for this model comes from the finding that overexpression of ERM-1 rescues lumen width and overall embryonic lethality of pigv-1 mutant embryos. ERM-1, the sole C. elegans ortholog of ezrin, radixin and moesin, is a linker protein that has an actin-binding domain and attaches to the PM through its FERM domain, serving to connect the PM with the actin cortex [39, 40] . ERM-1 overexpression did not increase the levels of GPI-APs in pigv-1 embryos and hence the reduction in lethality associated with it is most likely due to its membrane-cortex cross-linking function. From this we deduce that loss of GPI-APs leads to a weakening of apical membranes in epithelial cells, irrespective of the proteins attached to the GPI-anchor.Another epithelial tissue affected by pigv-1 loss of function is the excretory canal. Down regulation of GPI-APs in the excretory canal leads to cysts formation and this cystic excretory canal is usually short, consistent with apical membrane weakening upon the loss of GPI-APs. Unlike the intestine, which is a multicellular tubule, the excretory canal is a unicellular tubule that extends actively during embryo elongation. It has been demonstrated that a balance between membrane-actin cortex recruitment and translumenal flux is essential for the excretory canal extension [33] . Weakened apical membrane upon down regulation of GPI-APs in pigv-1 mutant embryo may prevent further recruitment of membrane components and actin undercoat to extend the canal, creating an imbalance between the two forces. Consequently, the dominant force, the translumenal flux is transmitted to enlarge the canal diameter, resulting in cysts formation. Another phenotype we observed in the excretory canal of pigv-1 mutants is ectopic branching. To our knowledge such a phenotype has not been associated with loss of function of any gene so far, opening a new avenue to study the regulation of tubular branching.Besides epithelial tissues, loss of GPI-APs in C. elegans may also affects neuronal and/or muscle tissues, suggested by the lethargic phenotype of pigv-1(qm34) worms, although the GPI-APs responsible for this phenotype remains to be identified. The short excretory canal that has been observed occasionally in pigv-1(qm34) could also result from the loss of GPI-APs from neuronal membrane. The neuronal cell adhesion molecules (NCAM) that are essential for axon outgrowth and pathfinding have been demonstrated to regulate excretory canal extension [41, 42, 43] . In the absence of NCAM, the excretory canal does not grow to full extent. Supporting this view, the in vitro and the in silico experiments found several NCAMs (rig-3, rig-6, rig-7 and wrk-1) to be potentially GPI-modified [7, 44] .Not all epithelial tissues displayed abnormal phenotypes in pigv-1 mutants. The pharynx and rectum are two epithelial tissues that do not seem to be affected by down regulation of GPI-APs. High enrichment of GPI-APs at pharyngeal membranes compared to other tissues could provide an explanation for the absence of weakened membrane phenotypes. However, this reason does not hold for the rectum, as GPI-APs at rectal membranes are not more abundant than other tissues that display weakened membrane. Since both pharynx and rectum are covered by a cuticle, the most likely explanation for the absence of visible phenotypes is that the cuticle protects both tissues from potential damage resulting from weakened membranes.Restoring PIGV-1 expression individually in the epidermis, intestine and excretory canal in pigv-1(qm34) embryos revealed that the defects in these epithelial tissues do not contribute equally to the embryonic lethality. The intestine and the excretory canal defects have higher contribution to embryonic lethality as compared to the epidermal defects. This is somewhat unexpected because 56% of pigv-1(qm34) embryos die due to tissues leakage from the embryo interior, indicating that a gap between epidermal cells is present from where the tissues pass through. However, uncontained high pressure built in the intestinal and excretory canal due to cell adhesion defects and membrane weakening may be sufficient to open epidermal junction and push the internal tissues out of embryo interior.Mutations in the human ortholog of C. elegans pigv-1, PIGV, have been associated in genetic studies with hyperphosphatasia-mental retardation syndrome (a.k.a Mabry syndrome). This autosomal recessive syndrome has a wide spectrum of phenotypes including intellectual disabilities, facial anomalies, hyperphosphatasia, vesicoureteral and renal anomalies, and anorectal anomalies [21] . With the exception of hyperphosphatasia, which is known to be the result of loss of GPI-anchored complement inhibitors in blood cells [34] , the proteins and cellular functions that are affected in humans with PIGV mutations are unknown. Although our findings in C. elegans cannot possibly fully explain the cellular physiology of the human disease, it does point to a basic mechanism, i.e., weakening of apical membranes in epithelial cells, that may be playing a role in some of the manifestations of the disease. Furthermore, if it will be discovered that epithelial membrane integrity is affected in human patients then our work also suggests a promising avenue for therapy, i.e., strengthening of the membrane-cortex connection, based on our ERM-1 overexpression results.", "citance": "This is in contrast to mammalian embryogenesis, in which complete PIGA depletion results in defects in tissue differentiation [35] .", "claims": [{"text": "PIGA depletion in mammalian embryogenesis results in defects in tissue differentiation.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

The direct assignment of tyrosine residues of PKG-I has remained to be made due to the low sensitivity of the current proteomic approach. In order to assign modified tyrosine residues of PKG-I, we nitrated purified PKG-I\u03b1 expressed in insect Sf9 cells by use of peroxynitrite in vitro and analyzed the trypsin-digested fragments by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization\u2013time of flight mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Among the 21 tyrosine residues of PKG-I\u03b1, 16 tyrosine residues were assigned in 13 fragments; and six tyrosine residues were nitrated, those at Y71, Y141, Y212, Y336, Y345, and Y567, in the peroxynitrite-treated sample. Single mutation of tyrosine residues at Y71, Y212, and Y336 to phenylalanine significantly reduced the nitration of PKG-I\u03b1; and four mutations at Y71, Y141, Y212, and Y336 (Y4F mutant) reduced it additively. PKG-I\u03b1 activity was inhibited by peroxynitrite in a concentration-dependent manner from 30 \u03bcM to 1 mM, and this inhibition was attenuated in the Y4F mutant. These results demonstrated that PKG-I\u03b1 was nitrated at multiple tyrosine residues and that its activity was reduced by nitration of these residues.", "citation_paragraph": "NO modifies tyrosine residues through nitration and sulfhydryl residues of protein such as cysteine through Snitrosylation, which has emerged as an important post- [31, 32] . Nitration is the addition of a nitro group (NO 2 ) to tyrosine and S-nitrosylation is the addition of a nitroso group (RS-N\u2550O) to cysteine thiol [15] . Although the well-known PKG pathway is the most important for NO-mediated biological processing, NO is also suggested to be involved in it through nitration of tyrosine to 3-NT and S-nitrosylation [33] [34] [35] . Recent reports have suggested that activation of endothelial NO synthase is increased and PKG activity is impaired through tyrosine nitration in pulmonary hypertension [23, 24] .3-NT conversion is an oxidative modification associated with many diseases, and only a limited number of 3-NTcontaining peptide sequences have been observed to date due to the low sensitivity of the current proteomic approach, especially in biological samples. Therefore, immunostaining with anti-3-NT antibodies has been usually employed for detection of 3-NT instead of MS detection. Although targeting of PKG nitration represents a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension, the direct assignment of nitrated tyrosine residues of PKG-I\u03b1 remained to be made. We first tried to express recombinant PKG-I\u03b1 in E. coli, but, as reported previously [1] , the recombinant protein was mainly present in an insoluble form and inactive, and thus could not be refolded into a functional enzyme; and, furthermore, it was degraded rapidly by proteolysis [1] . The present study used a baculovirus-mediated expression system in Sf9-insect cells for proteomics. We could express wild-type and mutant recombinant PKG-I\u03b1 in sufficient amounts to use the proteomic approach and purified the enzymes in Sf9 cells to homogeneity within a couple of days with a yield of 30 % without proteolytic loss. Quite recently, PKG-I\u03b1 was successfully purified as a functional enzyme with a bacterial expression system, giving a low yield of 2.26 %; and the enzyme was shown to be inhibited by peroxynitrite, H 2 O 2 , and the NO donor spermine NONOate [36] . Consistent with previous studies [23, 36] , in vitro treatment of purified PKG-I\u03b1 with peroxynitrite in the present study decreased the enzyme activity in a concentrationdependent manner. However, the enzyme was not inhibited by NOR1, an NO donor, at 1 mM (Electronic Supplementary  Material, Fig. S1A ). In the LC-MS/MS analysis, we first used nanoLC-ESI-QTOF MS/MS with a 50-min linear gradient from 5 to 50 % of solvent B at a flow rate of 0.5 \u03bcl/min. Whereas the score of protein sequence coverage was 42 %, only six peptide fragments containing a tyrosine residue were matched among the 21 tyrosine residues; and two tyrosine residues were found to have been nitrated at Y71 and Y336 (data not shown). By increasing the gradient time from 50 to 100 min, we successfully detected most of the trypsin-digested fragments of PKG-I\u03b1 in the peroxynitrite-treated sample. In comparison with LC-MS/MS, MALDI MS did not work for the detection of nitrated peptides, probably due to much lower contents of 3-NT than of the unmodified form in tyrosinecontaining peptides and because of their destruction by the laser shot employed here. Since PKG-I\u03b1 treated with 3 mM peroxynitrite was analyzed by LC-MS/MS, identification of the tyrosine residues responsible for the activity was verified by performing mutation analysis. Both a single tyrosine mutation and Y4F mutation of PKG-I\u03b1 did not significantly affect PKG activity (Fig. 3A) . Whereas the activity of the Y345F mutant was reduced at 0.03 mM, that of the Y4F mutant was reduced only at 0.3 mM (Fig. 3C) . These results suggest that Y71, Y212, and/or Y336 were affected by peroxynitrite at lower doses than Y345 and that the inhibitory effect of nitration at Y4F and Y345 was additive. Whereas nitration was weakly detected at 0.3 mM, the kinase activity of PKG-I\u03b1 was affected at 0.03 mM, which might result from the difference in sensitivity of detection. The activities of wild-type and mutant PKG-I\u03b1 were completely lost by treatment with peroxynitrite at high The modified peptides were verified by using a Mascot search, and the scores obtained are shown Nitrated tyrosine residues are presented in italics a Nitration of Y141 was matched from 133-152 fragment that was containing a missed cleavage site of trypsin. One of the detected fragments for Y345 (343-356) also had a missed cleavage site concentrations of 1-3 mM (Fig. 3C) . Since peroxynitrite is known to promote the nitration of tyrosine and tryptophan residues, and S-nitrosylation of cysteine residues (Electronic Supplementary Material, Fig. S1B ), the inhibition of PKG-I\u03b1 may have been caused by reactions besides tyrosine nitration at the higher concentrations. ]Phosphate incorporated into histone IIA was counted after SDS-PAGE as described in the \"Materials and methods\" section. The enzyme activity without treatment was taken as 100 %. C Tyrosine nitration of wild-type and mutated PKG-I\u03b1. Wild-type or mutated PKG-I\u03b1 (0.8 ng) was incubated for 10 min at room temperature with 3 mM peroxynitrite in 50 mM HEPES (pH 6.5) containing 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and 50 mM NaCl. The reaction mixtures were subjected to 7.5 % SDS-PAGE and sequentially immunoblotted with anti-3-NT and anti-PKG-I\u03b1/\u03b2 antibodies, as described in the legend for Fig. 1A .

AU arbitrary unit D Concentration dependency for peroxynitrite on the kinase activity of wild-type and Y345 and Y4F PKG-I\u03b1 mutants. The enzymes (0.4 ng) were preincubated with the indicated concentrations of peroxynitrite for 10 min at 30\u00b0C. The reaction was started by the addition of 1 \u03bcM [\u03b3-32 P]ATP (1 \u03bcCi), and the standard reaction mixture was then incubated for 5 min at 30\u00b0C. The enzyme activity of PKG without treatment was taken as 100 %. *P <0.05; vs. without treatment. E Overall fold of PKG from PDB and the data [29] was visualized RasMol software. Tyrosine residues in the PKG 78-355 were colored red. Nitrated tyrosine was indicated by red characters PKG-I contains three major functional domains: the aminoterminal dimerization/autoinhibitory domain, having two autophosphorylation sites, a regulatory domain containing two structurally distinct cGMP-binding sites (88-328), and the catalytic domain, bearing the kinase activity and containing binding sites for the Mg 2+ /ATP binding site and target protein (356-671) [30] . To identify target tyrosine residues responsible for impairment of PKG-I\u03b1 upon nitration, Zhao et al. [21] hypothesized that nitration sites were present in the catalytic domain of PKG-I\u03b1 and that nitration of Y345 and Y549 were responsible for the impairment of its activity by mutation analysis of tyrosine residues into phenylalanine. Although nitration was almost completely lost in Y345F mutant, it was also markedly attenuated in the Y549F mutant in the previous study. Similarly, either mutation of Y345F or Y549F abolished the inhibition of PKG-I\u03b1 activity by nitration. Therefore, it was not clear which tyrosine residue was involved in the loss of enzyme activity by nitration. In the present study, we directly identified 6 nitrated tyrosine residues in recombinant PKG-I\u03b1 by LC-MS/ MS (Fig. 2 , Table 2 ) and demonstrated that the Y4F mutation, at Y71, Y141, Y212, and Y336, significantly attenuated nitration of PKG-I\u03b1 by peroxynitrite even at 3 mM (Fig. 3B) . Conversely, PKG-I\u03b1 was nitrated at multiple sites, but nitrated fragments containing Y549 was not detected in the present study (Table 2) . Since Y567 was already reported not to be responsible for the activity [23] , mutation analysis of it was not carried out here. Since it was reported that the incorporation of a nitro group into protein tyrosine can lead to profound structural and functional changes [37] , it is probable that the tyrosine nitration in the cGMP binding site contribute to altered PKG-I\u03b1 activity. We grasped the PKG-I\u03b1 protein structure using PDB and RasMol, and the result shows that the nitration sites detected in this study can affect to the binding between PKG-I\u03b1 and cGMP (Fig. 3E) . Along with structural information, bioinformatics analysis could be useful for the understanding of 3-nitrotyrosine post-translational modification [38] in further studies.In the central nervous system, NO has been implicated in synaptic plasticity including long-term potentiation in the hippocampus and in pain transmission in the spinal cord [39, 40] . Many behavioral studies including ours have demonstrated that NO and peroxynitrite contribute to the development and maintenance of hyperalgesia and allodynia in models of acute and chronic pain, which are relieved by the blockade of the NO/cGMP/PKG signaling pathway in the spinal cord [11, 41, 42] . PKG-I\u03b1 has been recently shown to play an essential role in the expression of spinal long-term potentiation and pain hypersensitivity in conditional PGK-I\u03b1 knockout mice [10] . The present study provides a basis for further investigation to characterize positive and negative effects of NO via PKG-I\u03b1 during pathophysiological conditions including chronic pain and pulmonary hypertension.", "citance": "PKG-I\u03b1 has been recently shown to play an essential role in the expression of spinal long-term potentiation and pain hypersensitivity in conditional PGK-I\u03b1 knockout mice [10] .", "claims": [{"text": "PKG-la does not have a large impact on expression of pain hypersensitivity in PGK-la knockout mice.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "PKG-la does not have a large impact on expression of spinal long term potentiation in PGK-la knockout mice.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "PKG-la plays an essential role in expression of pain hypersensitivity in PGK-la knockout mice.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "PKG-la plays an essential role in expression of spinal long term potentiation in PGK-la knockout mice.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

To identify natural ligands of RXRA that are present in hematopoietic cells, we adapted an upstream activation sequence\u2013green fluorescent protein (UAS-GFP) reporter mouse to detect natural RXRA ligands in vivo. We observed reporter activity in diverse types of hematopoietic cells in vivo. Reporter activity increased during granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)\u2013induced granulopoiesis and after phenylhydrazine (PHZ)\u2013induced anemia, suggesting the presence of dynamically regulated natural RXRA ligands in hematopoietic cells. Mouse plasma activated Gal4-UAS reporter cells in vitro, and plasma from mice treated with G-CSF or PHZ recapitulated the patterns of reporter activation that we observed in vivo. Plasma from mice with dietary vitamin A deficiency only mildly reduced RXRA reporter activity, whereas plasma from mice on a fatty acid restriction diet reduced reporter activity, implicating fatty acids as plasma RXRA ligands. Through differential extraction coupled with mass spectrometry, we identified the long-chain fatty acid C24:5 as a natural RXRA ligand that was greatly increased in abundance in response to hematopoietic stress. Together, these data suggest that natural RXRA ligands are present and dynamically increased in abundance in mouse hematopoietic cells in vivo.", "citation_paragraph": "RXRA is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that participates in several essential biological processes, including development, metabolism, and hematopoiesis. Although multiple RXRA-deficient mouse models have been used to study its function, these studies have not addressed whether endogenous RXRA ligands are present or whether their concentrations in hematopoietic cells are altered in response to stimuli in vivo. Other groups have used a UAS-Gal4 reporter system to explore natural RXRA ligands in the developing mouse spinal cord, although none have examined the presence of natural RXRA ligands in hematopoiesis (30) . By using a similar in vivo reporter system, we found that natural RXRA ligands are present and dynamically increase in concentration in mouse hematopoietic cells and plasma after hematopoietic stress induced by G-CSF or PHZ. Finally, we identified the long-chain fatty acid C24:5 as a natural RXRA ligand in mice. 9-cis-RA was initially identified as a high-affinity, highly active ligand for RXRA in vitro (3, 4). However, it has been the low-affinity long-chain fatty acids, such as DHA (8) , that have been implicated as natural ligands in vivo. Our data further support a role for low-affinity long-chain fatty acids as natural ligands for RXRA and demonstrate that these lipids may be dynamically regulated in vivo. RARA-RXRA heterodimers play important roles in hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis (31, 32) . Most of the patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) express the fusion protein promyelocytic leukemia-RARA, and at least 10 additional proteins have been identified as RARA fusion partners in APL patients (33) . Using our in vivo reporter strategy, we did not detect natural RARA ligands in hematopoietic cells in vivo (20) or in mouse plasma ( fig. S3C) . Instead, we observed evidence of natural ligands of RXRA in both hematopoietic cells and plasma and found that reporter activity increased during myeloid stress, such as that caused by G-CSF or PHZ treatment (Figs. 2 and 4) , but not after stem cell stress, such as that induced by 5-FU ( fig. S3A) . We observed no reporter activity when bone marrow cells were transduced with a form of RXRA lacking the AF2 domain, which is required for ligand-dependent activation of the reporter, suggesting that the increased reporter activity after induction of myeloid stress was due to increased concentrations of natural RXRA ligands. Because this deletion only prevents ligand-dependent activation of the reporter, it does not control for alternative, ligand-independent effects on RXRA that could result from G-CSF or PHZ treatment, and this limitation must be acknowledged, although increased concentrations of RXRA ligands DHA and C24:5 were observed in parallel by MS. RXRs are central members of the nuclear receptor superfamily (1) and can function as homodimers (10) or heterodimers (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) . PPAR-RXRs are permissive heterodimers that can be activated by either PPAR ligands or RXR ligands (34) . In contrast, TR-RXR and VDR-RXR are nonpermissive heterodimers, which only can be activated in the presence of TR ligands or VDR ligands, respectively (35) . PPARs participate in self-renewal of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (36, 37) , TRs influence proliferation and differentiation of erythroid progenitors (38) , and VDR deficiency promotes survival of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in the spleen (39) . Both RXRs and PPARs can be activated by long-chain fatty acids. However, we did not observe activation of the reporter when cells were treated with PPAR ligands (8, 22) , suggesting that the UAS-Gal4 system was responding specifically to RXRA ligands ( fig. S2, B and C) .We found that RXRA reporter activity increased during GSCFinduced granulopoiesis. Through studies with RXR-KO mice, we found that RXR activation contributed to G-CSF-induced mobilization of HSCs (although it was not absolutely required) and that G-CSFinduced mobilization of HSCs was augmented by the addition of pharmacologic concentrations of RXR ligands (Fig. 3, A to E) .The vitamin A derivatives 9-cis-RA and 9-cis-13,14-DHRA have been proposed as natural RXRA ligands in mouse serum, brain, and liver (3, 4, 7) . However, when we examined plasma in a VAD mouse model, in which plasma retinol concentrations were undetectable (Fig. 5A) , we nevertheless detected activation of the RXRA reporter, consistent with the presence of RXRA ligands (Fig. 5B) . These data suggest that the predominant plasma RXRA ligands both under baseline Error bars represent SDs of independent triplicate experiments. EC 50 determined by fitting the data to a log(agonist) variable slope with four parameters. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.conditions and after PHZ treatment are unlikely to be vitamin A derivatives. In contrast, multiple groups have suggested that fatty acids might serve as activating RXR ligands. The crystallographic analysis of a constitutively active mutant form of mouse RXRA (RXRA F318A ) revealed a continuous U-shaped electron density in the ligand-binding cavity, suggesting the presence of a bound ligand and consistent with a fatty acid of 16 or 18 carbon atoms (27) . C18:1 can activate the RXRA reporter ex vivo but with low efficiency (8) . We detected fatty acid C18:1 in mouse serum and found that it was more abundant in mouse than in goat serum, but its concentration was not affected by PHZ treatment (table S1) . Moreover, we found that C18:1 could be extracted by methanol/H 2 O (1:1), yet the products extracted by methanol/H 2 O (1:1) did not activate the RXRA reporter (Fig. 6C) . The unsaturated fatty acids C20:4, C22:5, and C22:6 have been identified as Rxr ligands in mouse brain (8) . We detected C22:5 in both mouse and goat serum, although goat serum did not activate the RXRA reporter ( Fig. 6A and  table S1 ). We also found that C22:5 did not coimmunoprecipitate with RXRA when the reporter cells were incubated with serum, although C22:6 did (table S1). However, PHZ treatment did not consistently affect C22:6 concentrations in VAD mice and NF mice (table S1), suggesting that C22:6 may contribute to basal RXR activation but does not appear to increase in concentration in response to PHZ. In contrast, C24:5 was consistently detected by MS under conditions that lead to activation of the RXRA reporter and was dynamically increased in plasma concentration after PHZ treatment. Commercially synthesized C24:5 activated the RXRA reporter, activated a DR1-luciferase reporter when coexpressed with full-length RXRA, and induced dose-dependent coactivator binding to purified RXRA (Figs. 7 and 8 ), suggesting that this lipid is a natural RXRA ligand that increases in plasma concentration in response to hematopoietic signals.In summary, we observed evidence of activating natural ligands for RXRA in mouse hematopoietic cells, as well as in plasma and serum. Concentrations of these ligands were increased after G-CSF-or PHZ-induced myeloid stress, and we identified C24:5 as a likely natural RXRA ligand that undergoes dynamic increases in concentration during myeloid stress. These data do not address further important questions: Which pathways lead to alterations in serum concentrations of natural RXRA ligands? Do differences in diet augment or diminish RXRA signaling and the subsequent consequences on inflammation and bone metabolism? Does intervention with RXRA agonists improve stem cell mobilization or augment G-CSF-induced NE count recovery after chemotherapy?

{"s2orc_id": 2046716, "title": "Transcriptional repressors: multifaceted regulators of gene expression.", "abstract": "Through decades of research it has been established that some chromatin-modifying proteins can repress transcription, and thus are generally termed 'repressors'. Although classic repressors undoubtedly silence transcription, genome-wide studies have shown that many repressors are associated with actively transcribed loci and that this is a widespread phenomenon. Here, we review the evidence for the presence of repressors at actively transcribed regions and assess what roles they might be playing. We propose that the modulation of expression levels by chromatin-modifying, co-repressor complexes provides transcriptional fine-tuning that drives development.", "citation_paragraph": "From the reasonable, although simplistic, view that repressors act to inhibit transcription, it might be expected that these complexes would only be found occupying silent regions of the genome. However, based on DNA association alone, assessed by genomewide ChIP analyses, it is clear that lysine deacetylases are not confined to silent loci (Dovey et al., 2010; Kurdistani et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2002; Wir\u00e9n et al., 2005) . A comprehensive study to assess the genome-wide distribution of multiple KDACs and KATs in human T cells revealed that a surprisingly small proportion (~20%) of KDACs were found at silent loci. By contrast, up to 75% of KDAC proteins were identified at actively transcribed regions, although the proportion varied depending on the protein investigated (Wang et al., 2009) . Similarly, in Drosophila melanogaster, the chromatin remodeller protein Mi-2 is normally associated with gene repression as part of the nucleosome remodelling and deacetylation (NuRD) co-repressor complex (Ahringer, 2000; Kehle et al., 1998) . However, Mi-2 colocalises with the elongating form of RNA Polymerase II (RNA PolII) at actively transcribed genes on polytene chromosomes and is recruited to sites of transcription upon heat shock (Mathieu et al., 2012; Murawska et al., 2011; Murawska et al., 2008) . Furthermore, larvae either depleted of Mi-2 or expressing a dominant ATPasemutant form of the protein showed significantly reduced levels of heat-shock transcripts, demonstrating that Mi-2 function is important for transcription in this context (Murawska et al., 2011) .The mammalian orthologue of Drosophila Mi-2 is Mi2\u03b2 (Chd4), a defining component of the mammalian NuRD complex. NuRD is a classic lysine deacetylase-containing co-repressor complex. In addition to Mi2\u03b2, the NuRD complex consists of a core of two lysine deacetylase proteins, Hdac1 and Hdac2, along with two chaperone proteins, Rbbp4 and Rbbp7, together with associated proteins. These accessory proteins include Gatad2a, Gatad2b, Mta1, Mta2 and/or Mta3, Cdk2ap1 and the scaffolding protein Mbd3 (Bowen et al., 2004; Le Guezennec et al., 2006; McDonel et al., 2009; Tong et al., 1998; Wade et al., 1998; Xue et al., 1998; Zhang et al., 1998) . Other associated proteins, such as Sall4, Lsd1 (Kdm1a), Ikaros (Ikzf1) or Oct4 (Pou5f1), may associate with a fraction of NuRD complexes in a cell typespecific manner. NuRD has been shown to repress transcription in a wide variety of cell types and systems (Ahringer, 2000; McDonel et al., 2009 ). Nevertheless, a number of ChIP-seq studies have found Mi2\u03b2 also to be associated with a surprisingly large number of active gene loci in different cell types (Reynolds et al., 2012b; Whyte et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2012) .ChIP-seq experiments for components of the polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs), or the marks they leave on chromatin (e.g. trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone H3, H3K27Me3; and monoubiquitylation of lysine 119 of histone H2A, H2Aub1), have also found that PRC target genes are often expressed at intermediate or high levels (Brookes et al., 2012; Schwartz et al., 2010; Young et al., 2011) . At first glance, this would appear to indicate that PRC complexes do, occasionally, co-exist with active RNA polymerase at the same genes. In apparent contradiction to this observation, an analysis of PRC target genes in D. melanogaster showed that PRC1-bound promoters are actually associated with stalled, but not elongating, RNA polymerase (Enderle et al., 2011) . A similar set of correlations was recently reported for mammalian PRC components in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells (Brookes et al., 2012) . Using sequential ChIP (in which DNA is immunoprecipitated sequentially by antibodies recognising two different proteins to identify sequences simultaneously bound by the two proteins), Brookes et al. (Brookes et al., 2012) found that PRC components could only be immunoprecipitated at DNA associated with the poised polymerase (S5P), but not with the elongating polymerase (S2P). This indicates that PRC and the elongating polymerase do not colocalise to a given gene at the same time, but rather that ES cell cultures consist of a heterogeneous mixture of cells in which certain genes are either associated with PRC and thus transcriptionally poised, or are free of PRC influence and in the process of active elongation (Brookes et al., 2012) .Further hints of the diverse functionality of co-repressors have come from expression analyses in loss-of-function experiments.Removal of co-repressor function, either genetically or through the use of chemical inhibitors, results in gene expression changes that tend to be subtle. Rather than genes going from off to on, as might be expected if these proteins function simply to silence, loss of repressor proteins often results in a modest (up to ten times) increase in the levels of some transcripts, many of which are not normally silent in wild-type cells. Loss of co-repressor proteins usually results in similar numbers of genes decreasing in expression as increasing (Bernstein et al., 2000; Harrison et al., 2011; Lenstra et al., 2011; Reynolds et al., 2012a; Williams et al., 2011; Wir\u00e9n et al., 2005; Yoshida et al., 2008; Zupkovitz et al., 2006) . Although in many instances increase in transcript levels could be an indirect effect of loss of repressive activity (e.g. failure to repress a repressor), in at least some of these cases genes found to be downregulated in the mutants are bound by the repressor in wild-type cells (e.g. Reynolds et al., 2012b; Williams et al., 2011) , indicating that these repressors might act to regulate different loci in opposing directions.", "citance": "A similar set of correlations was recently reported for mammalian PRC components in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells (Brookes et al., 2012) .", "claims": [{"text": "PRC1-bound promoters are associated with stalled RNA polymerase.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

In response to various environmental cues, VSMCs can dedifferentiate from a contractile state to a highly proliferative synthetic state through the so-called \u2018phenotypic switching\u2019 process. Changes in VSMC phenotype contribute to numerous vascular-related diseases, including atherosclerosis, calcification, and restenosis following angioplasty. Adventitial VSMC progenitor cells also contribute to formation of the neointima. Herein, we review both, the roles of VSMC differentiation in vascular diseases, and the in vitro models used to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of VSMC differentiation and phenotype modulation. A comprehensive understanding of VSMC behavior in vascular diseases is essential to identify new therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.", "citation_paragraph": "Vascular calcification (VC) is an active and complicated process regulated by multiple factors that involves several cytokines and their associated signaling pathways. VC is widely seen in numerous vascular-related diseases, including atherosclerosis, chronic kidney disease (CKD), hypertension, and diabetes (Bessueille and Magne, 2015) . The conventional viewpoint suggests that vascular calcification mainly occurs in the arterial intima and media. However, in vitro studies have observed calcified lesions in the aortic adventitia in humans, suggesting that adventitial calcification may arise from fibroblasts which had been transformed into myofibroblasts or VSMCs (Li et al., 2015) . There are numerous vascular cells, including VSMCs, myofibroblasts, vascular mesenchymal progenitors, and ECs that have been shown to be involved in vascular calcification (Steitz et shown that carotid ligation in mice having a VSMC-specific heterozygous PTEN deletion resulted in enhanced neointima formation, increased VSMC hyperplasia, reduced expression of VSMC markers (\u03b1-SMA and calponin), increased PI3-kinase/Akt/mTOR signaling, and NF-kB activity compared with wild-type mice (Furgeson et al., 2010) . These data indicate that inactivation of PTEN exclusively in VSMCs promotes a pro-inflammatory phenotype and enhances neointima formation. Consistent with this viewpoint, a further study, using both mouse genetic models and in vitro approaches, demonstrated that PTEN is an essential regulator of the transcriptional activity of SRF which plays an important role in the mechanism that dynamically regulates the expression of VSMC contractile genes (Horita et al., 2016) . Thus, loss of the PTEN-SRF axis promotes reprogramming of VSMCs into a proliferative, and inflammatory phenotype. Therefore, targeting PTEN-SRF nuclear interactions has the potential to produce novel therapeutics that preserve the mature differentiated VSMC phenotype in order to inhibit in-stent restenosis. Collectively, these data support the conclusion that an alteration in VSMC PTEN signaling acts as a critical initiating determinant driving pathological vascular remodeling.", "citance": "Consistent with this viewpoint, a further study, using both mouse genetic models and in vitro approaches, demonstrated that PTEN is an essential regulator of the transcriptional activity of SRF which plays an important role in the mechanism that dynamically regulates the expression of VSMC contractile genes (Horita et al., 2016) .", "claims": [{"text": "PTEN is a regulator for the transcriptional activity of SRF", "subject": "PTEN", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 32498157, "title": "Prolonged asystole provoked by head-up tilt testing", "abstract": "We describe a patient with a history of neurocardiogenic syncopes who had a positive headup tilt test that resulted in an lasting asystole lasting 34 seconds. However, the previously carried out Schellong test with a 30-min phase of standing showed a normal result. The patient showed typical orthostatic symptoms while tilted at the angle of 75\u00b0. Shortly before asystole occurred, heart rate variability showed high frequency bands, indicating vagal stimulation. The pathophysiology of neurocardiogenic syncope (NCS) in context with heart rate variability is discussed. This patient was successfully treated with propranolol. This case shows the utility of a provocative head-up tilt test in establishing the diagnosis of NCS. If the Schellong test is normal, still further examination by tilt-table test is indispensable.", "citation_paragraph": "The case has several interesting issues.n The long duration of asystolic episode First of all, our patient demonstrated a long period of asystole (34 s) during HUT, similar to the longest pauses reported previously in the literature [2, 17, 18, 23, 29] . Prior to the introduction of the tilt-table examination, NCS used to be diagnosed by excluding other causes. NCS is the most common form of reflex syncope. It usually occurs in younger individuals, as in our case, and is marked by characteristic prodromal symptoms of varying duration and intensity. These include vertigo, epigastric sensations, auditory disorders, and sweating, followed by loss of consciousness. The patients usually recover rapidly.n Pathophysiology of NCS in context with heart rate variability of our patientThe HRV analysis performed here demonstrated, firstly, the expected enhancement of sympathetic heart rate control and decrease in vagal heart rate control with tilt. Further, the reduction in sympathetic heart rate control just prior to syncope was expected and has been previously described. Of more interest, however, is the small enhancement of high frequency power preceding the asystolic event, consistent with vagal activation as the etiology.The pathophysiological mechanism of NCS is well investigated: enhanced peripheral venous pooling decreases the venous backflow to the heart. The systemic blood pressure is kept stable by the activity of the baroreflex and cardiopulmonary low-pressure baro-receptors, which lead to activation of the sympathetic nervous system and vagus inhibition (this is in accordance with our heart rate variability recording; Fig. 3 ). In addition to peripheral vasoconstriction, an acceleration of the heart rate takes place. A consecutive increase in ventricular inotropism activates mechanoreceptors, which are present in large numbers in the posterior wall of the left ventricle. The sudden increase in neural signals over slow-conducting C-fibres of the solitary tract and the solitary nucleus of the brain stem mimic the conditions of hypertension [12] . This results in a paradox inhibition of the sympathetic system (fall in blood pressure) and vagal activation (bradycardia to asystole, as in our case; see also recordings of vagal stimulation in Fig. 3 ), followed by a syncope. In fact, rapid activation of similar receptors at various locations may, given the appropriate predisposition, cause similar effects and trigger reflex syncopes (e.g. miction or coughing syncope).n Controversies about treatment A number of pharmacological treatment approaches exist for this disorder, some based on various pathophysiological aspects of NCS; however, in general, the efficacy of these approaches has not been substantiated by controlled data from randomised trials. Beta-blockers have been suggested to be effective in several trials [13, 21, 27] , but have also been equivalent to placebo in others [4, 24] . Therefore, a large 45 R. Winker et al. Asystole provoked by tilt test Fig. 3 Measurement of heart rate variability during HUT. On the x-axis, the frequency of heart rate changes, on the y-axis, the minutes of the HUT can be seen. The onset of tilting is marked with a capital T after 20 min of supine red. In the initial phase of tilting, strong sympathetic low frequency components of heart rate variability are present, which disappear before asystole. Just prior to asystole, high frequency vagal components (0.15-0.5 Hz) appear, labelled by a circle randomised clinical trial will address the question of the effectiveness of beta-blockers in the prevention of neurocardiogenic syncope [25] . Theoretically, beta-blockers will reduce the ventricular hypercontractility phase through their negative inotropic effect, leading to reduced stimulation of vagal afferents by means of ventricular mechanoreceptors. Patients with the highest increase in serum norepinephrine levels may benefit most from the treatment [14] , as was the case in our patient. Although beta-blockers may enhance bradycardia in cardioinhibitory forms of syncope, beta-blocker therapy appears to have been effective in our patient over a follow-up period of 12 months. A similar observation of a patient with NCS, who remained syncope-free for 6 months under the medication of ipratropium-bromide was recently reported by Friedrich et al. [8] .Very few well-performed randomised controlled trials have been performed which deal with alternative drugs to beta-blockers for the treatment of NCS and show satisfactory results over placebo (alphaagonists, serotonin reuptake inhibitors) [4] . Pacing has recently been the subject of controlled trials. In a randomised controlled syncope treatment study, pacemakers were superior to the beta-blocker atenolol in preventing syncopal recurrences [1] . For that reason, we recommended the implantation of a pacemaker, which the patient refused.Also physical treatments [4] and head-up tilt of bed [11] are arising as novel first-choice treatment for NCS. Isometric arm and leg counterpressure manoeuvres have been proposed recently as safe and cost-effective first-line treatment for NCS. For reviews dealing with this subject see [11, 19, 31] .Vasovagal syncope generally has been reported to have a benign prognosis [26] , with no cardiac-related deaths over a 40-month follow-up in one series of patients with asystole induced by head-up tilt test [2] . Nevertheless, some authors have related it to rare events of sudden death [20] . Longer term follow-up will be necessary to fully address this question.", "citance": "In a randomised controlled syncope treatment study, pacemakers were superior to the beta-blocker atenolol in preventing syncopal recurrences [1] .", "claims": [{"text": "Pacemakers are better at preventing syncopal recurrences than the beta-blocker atenolol.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 43479697, "title": "Evolution of Dominance in Sporophytic Self-Incompatibility Systems: I. Genetic Load and Coevolution of Levels of Dominance in Pollen and Pistil", "abstract": "Recent theoretical advances have suggested that various forms of balancing selection may promote the evolution of dominance through an increase of the proportion of heterozygote genotypes. We test whether dominance can evolve in the sporophytic self-incompatibility (SSI) system in plants. SSI prevents mating between individuals expressing identical SI phenotypes by recognition of pollen by pistils, which avoids selfing and inbreeding depression. SI phenotypes depend on a complex network of dominance relationships between alleles at the self-incompatibility locus (S-locus). Empirical studies suggest that these relationships are not random, but the exact evolutionary processes shaping these relationships remain unclear. We investigate the expected patterns of dominance under the hypothesis that dominance is a direct target of natural selection. We follow the fate of a mutant allele at the S-locus whose dominance relationships are changed but whose specificity remains unaltered. We show that strict codominance is not evolutionary stable in SSI, and that inbreeding depression due to deleterious mutations linked or unlinked to the S-locus exerts strong constraints on changes in relative levels of dominance in pollen and pistil. Our results provide a general adaptive explanation for most patterns of dominance relationships empirically observed in natural plant populations.", "citation_paragraph": "Our results show that in SSI systems, mutations either increasing or decreasing the dominance of an S-allele relative to other extant alleles are generally favored in populations with codominant alleles, whereas mutations leading to codominance are disfavored when the population contains dominant alleles. This occurs because of a \"hiding effect\": although strict codominance restricts mating to pairs of genotypes carrying different S-alleles (four distinct alleles), a dominant S-allele hides its co-occurring allele. Heterozygotes carrying one dominant S-allele are therefore expected to have more compatible mates than heterozygotes with codominant alleles, and thus dominance interactions will be favored. Similar results were obtained by Schoen and Busch (2009) . The two models differ by the fact that the latter explicitly modeled recombination between the S-locus and the modifier locus, and found that tight linkage was required for the evolution of stable associations between S-alleles and specific dominance modifier alleles. Because the S-locus region in Brassicaceae is highly divergent among S-alleles (Tang et al. 2007 ) and essentially contains nonrecombining allele-specific sequences (Sato et al. 2002; Kamau et al. 2007) , tight linkage between S-alleles and modifier alleles may readily occur. In short, this hiding effect creates a selective pressure favoring the evolution of dominance in species with SSI, especially when there is tight linkage between dominance modifier and the S-locus. This selective pressure is lowered when the number of S-alleles increases as it is shown in Figure 4 , however dominance evolution does not change qualitatively. This hiding effect is similar to that expected in genes controlling host-parasite interactions (Nuismer and Otto 2005) , allowing parasite genes responsible for the infection to minimize the probability of recognition by resistance genes of the host. In M\u00fcllerian mimicry in Heliconius butterflies, a high allelic diversity is observed due to selection to mimic phenotypes of other species. In the case of H. numata, the mimicry seems to be controlled by a single locus, and hierarchical dominance relationships are observed among alleles (Joron et al. 2006) , which suggests that similar selection processes such as in the case of SSI could be acting on dominance at this locus, preventing the appearance of intermediate and nonmimetic phenotypes. Indeed, if alleles at the coloration locus were codominant, individuals would show intermediate coloration phenotype and would not be recognized by predators as unpalatable. Hence, codominant alleles should be disfavored. However, further studies are needed to determine if strong selection is exerted on the dominance of multiallelic loci involved in recognition processes, such as mating-types genes or genes involved in host-parasite interactions.", "citance": "This hiding effect is similar to that expected in genes controlling host-parasite interactions (Nuismer and Otto 2005) , allowing parasite genes responsible for the infection to minimize the probability of recognition by resistance genes of the host.", "claims": [{"text": "Parasites minimize probability of recognition by resistance genes of the host through mimicry of phenotypes.", "subject": " genes ", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 17376410, "title": "Effect of malarial infection on haematological parameters in population near Thailand-Myanmar border", "abstract": "BACKGROUND Malaria is a major mosquito-borne public health problem in Thailand with varied haematological consequences. The study sought to elucidate the haematological changes in people who suspected malaria infection and their possible predictive values of malaria infection.   METHODS Haematological parameters of 4,985 patients, including 703 malaria-infected and 4,282 non-malaria infected, who admitted at Phop Phra Hospital, Tak Province, an area of malaria endemic transmission in Thailand during 2009 were evaluated.   RESULTS The following parameters were significantly lower in malaria-infected patients; red blood cells (RBCs) count, haemoglobin (Hb), platelets count, white blood cells (WBCs) count, neutrophil, monocyte, lymphocyte and eosinophil counts, while mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), Mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and monocyte-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) were higher in comparison to non-malaria infected patients. Patients with platelet counts < 150,000/uL were 31.8 times (odds ratio) more likely to have a malaria infection. Thrombocytopenia was present in 84.9% of malaria-infected patients and was independent of age, gender and nationality (P value < 0.0001).   CONCLUSION Patients infected with malaria exhibited important changes in most of haematological parameters with low platelet, WBCs, and lymphocyte counts being the most important predictors of malaria infection. When used in combination with other clinical and microscopy methods, these parameters could improve malaria diagnosis and treatment.", "citation_paragraph": "This study confirms that haematological abnormalities in malaria infection are common. Leucopenia was frequently seen in the malaria-infected patients which was confirmed by other studies that have demonstrated leucopenia [6, 15] and contrast with another study that had demonstrate leucocytosis [3] . Neutrophil and lymphocyte counts were the most important leukocytic changes associated with malaria infection. The decrease in lymphocyte counts associated with malaria observed in this study may due to reflect redistribution of lymphocytes with sequestration in the spleen [6, 17] . The decrease in neutrophil count associated with malaria infection was in contrast with previous studies which suggested that it might be activated neutrophil production or release from the marrow or suppressed peripheral removal [3] .The observation of decreased monocytes counts in this study was also in contrast with previous studies [3, 18] . Mononuclear cells, which are activated by Plasmodium during malarial infection, produce inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1 (IL1) and interleukin-6 (IL6). These cytokines stimulate the hepatic synthesis of acute phase inflammatory proteins, including CRP, which increase during malaria infection [17] .Anaemia is one of the most common complications in malaria infection especially in younger children and pregnant women in high transmission areas [19] . The pathogenesis of anaemia during malaria infection is not clearly understood. However, It is thought to result from the parasite's primary target is the red blood cell resulting in RBCs destruction, accelerated removal of both parasitized and non-parasitized [20] , bone marrow dysfunction [21] and the level of parasitemia [22] . This study, reported a significant reduction of Hb level and RBC count whereas MCV, MCH, and MCHC level in patients infected with malaria were higher as compared to non-malaria infected group. There are no evidence relate to higher level of MCV, MCH, and MCHC and pathogenesis of malaria infection but it has been suggested that people with \u03b1 + -thalassaemia protected malaria infection by a direct interaction between the parasite (Plasmodium falciparum) and the altered thalassaemic erythrocyte, resulting in reduced parasite load [23] . Most studies showed that \u03b1 + -thalassaemia homozygotes have better protection against severe malarial anaemia compared to heterozygotes [24, 25] . Moreover, patients with microcytosis and higher erythrocyte count associated with \u03b1 + -thalassaemia homozygosity had an advantage against severe malarial anaemia during acute infection with Plasmodium falciparum [26] .Platelet abnormalities in malaria are both qualitative and quantitative change. In this study, platelet counts were significantly reduced in malaria-infected people. Thrombocytopenia occurred in 84.9% of malariainfected patients. These observations may imply that thrombocytopenia may be a marker of Plasmodium infection. The association of platelet count and malaria infection has previously been described [3, 7, 18] . Patients with thrombocytopenia were also likely to have an anaemia (r = -0.107, P value = 0.004) and correlate with age (r = -0.235, P value < 0.0001) as previously reported from a study in Kenya and Nigeria [3, 8] . There were various hypotheses about thrombocytopenia occurring in malaria infection. Thrombocytopenia seems to occur through peripheral destruction [9] , excessive removal of platelets by spleen pooling [27, 28] as well as platelet consumption by the process of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) [29] . Adequate or increased number of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow affects decreased thrombopoiesis an unlikely cause of thrombocytopaenia in malaria [27] . Immune-mediated destruction of circulating platelets has been postulated as a cause of thrombocytopenia seen in malaria infection. Platelets have also been shown to mediate clumping of P. falciparum infected erythrocytes [30] . This could lead to pseudo thrombocytopenia. Malaria-infected patients have elevated levels of specific immunoglobulinG (IgG) in the blood which binds to platelet-bound malaria antigens possibly leading to accelerated destruction of platelets [10] . The previous study revealed that platelet aggregation, which is the platelet clumps are falsely counted as single platelet by the analyzers thus causing pseudo-thrombocytopenia [3] . Additionally, during malaria infection, endothelial activation was activated and may contribute to loss of barrier function of the endothelium and organ dysfunction. This process may use platelets and their released proteins as an important regulator of endothelial permeability resulting in thrombocytopaenia [31] .In this study, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and diagnostic accuracy for all haematoparameter were determined. Among of those parameter, thrombocytopenia (platelet counts < 150,000/\u03bcl) had the best sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value (85% sensitivity, 85% specificity, and 97% negative predictive value) which were higher than the previous studies [11, 12] while the positive predictive value was low (48%). The two most reliable haematological parameters for predicting malaria in people from endemic areas were thrombocytopenia and leucopenia. Patients with thrombocytopenia were 31.8 times more likely to have malaria infection than those with normal platelets count. Thrombocytopenia and leucopenia had sensitivity of 85% and 17%, specificity 85% and 94%, respectively to predict malaria infection. Patients with leucopenia (WBCs <4,000/\u03bcL) were 2.7 times more likely to have malaria infection than those with normal leucocytes count. High neutrophil counts, leucopenia, and lymphopenia had good specificity but lacked sensitivity to screening of malaria infection. The monocytes to lymphocytes ratio (ML ratio) in this study was high supported by the previous study that the ML ratio, which was measured in peripheral blood was directly correlates with risk of clinical malaria during follow-up [5] . This may due to the major role of the monocytes in the first time of innate immune response by releasing IFN\u03b3, to response to malaria infection [32] . When considered the neutrophil to lymphocytes ratio (NL ratio) in this study, it was also high which supported that the NL ratio was found to correlate with malaria parasitaemia [4] . Limitations of this study included lack of previous medical histories such as other diseases that may have analysis bias such as Hb diseases, anaemia, bacteria or virus infection, which could potentially affect the interpretation of the results.", "citance": "Moreover, patients with microcytosis and higher erythrocyte count associated with \u03b1 + -thalassaemia homozygosity had an advantage against severe malarial anaemia during acute infection with Plasmodium falciparum [26] .Platelet abnormalities in malaria are both qualitative and quantitative change.", "claims": [{"text": "Patients with microcytosis and higher erythrocyte count are more vulnerable to severe malarial anaemia when infected with Plasmodium falciparum.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Patients with microcytosis and higher erythrocyte count were more resistant to severe malarial anaemia when infected with Plasmodium falciparum.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

{"s2orc_id": 132772303, "title": "The Role of Monocytes and Macrophages in Human Atherosclerosis, Plaque Neoangiogenesis, and Atherothrombosis", "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. It is a complex disease characterized by lipid accumulation within the arterial wall, inflammation, local neoangiogenesis, and apoptosis. Innate immune effectors, in particular monocytes and macrophages, play a pivotal role in atherosclerosis initiation and progression. Although most of available evidence on the role of monocytes and macrophages in atherosclerosis is derived from animal studies, a growing body of evidence elucidating the role of these mononuclear cell subtypes in human atherosclerosis is currently accumulating. A novel pathogenic role of monocytes and macrophages in terms of atherosclerosis initiation and progression, in particular concerning the role of these cell subsets in neovascularization, has been discovered. The aim of the present article is to review currently available evidence on the role of monocytes and macrophages in human atherosclerosis and in relation to plaque characteristics, such as plaque neoangiogenesis, and patients' prognosis and their potential role as biomarkers.", "citation_paragraph": "Blood monocytes and eventually resident vascular macrophages are the leukocytes that are recruited earlier in the nascent atherosclerotic lesion [24] . Direct evidence concerning the recruitment and activation of monocytes and macrophages in humans is currently unavailable, and most of our knowledge is derived from studies on animal models. Local activation of inflammation has been shown to induce the production of cytokines and chemokines, among which C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), also termed monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), appears to play a major role [25] [26] [27] . These soluble chemotactic signals recruit circulating monocytes within the blood vessel wall through C-C chemokine receptor (CCR)2 and CCR4 [28] . Of note, studies performed in mouse models of atherosclerosis have shown that different subsets of monocytes are differentially recruited into the atherosclerotic plaque. Indeed, monocytes expressing high levels of surface lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, i.e., Ly6C hi monocytes, appear to be the greatest contributors to plaque macrophages. The human orthologue of Ly6C hi monocytes is the CD14 + CD16 -monocytes, currently referred also as \"classical\" monocytes [29] . Their putative role appears to be proinflammatory [30] and was shown to be increased in specific dyslipidemic conditions [31] . While CD14 + CD16 -monocytes have been initially reported to predict cardiovascular events, [32] a subsequent work showed that a different subset with more markedly inflammatory functions and with no murine counterpart, the intermediate CD14 hi CD16 + monocytes, has been implicated as a key cell type in the development of atherosclerosis [30] .Classical histological studies have shown that monocytes and resident macrophages undergo local proliferation [33] and eventually mature and acquire a phagocytic phenotype. Lineage-tracing studies have indeed found that peripheral proliferation of macrophages is the dominant mechanism for macrophage increase in atherosclerotic lesions [34] . Once within the vessel wall, macrophages and monocyte-derived macrophages start scavenging oxidized LDL (OxLDL) [35] . The uptake of OxLDL is mediated by surface scavenging receptors, including scavenger receptor-(SR-) A1, SR-B2 (also termed CD36), and E1 (also termed lectin-like OxLDL receptor-1 (LOX-1)) [36] . Interestingly, these receptors seem to be under the transcriptional control of the nuclear factor-(NF-)-kB, an inflammatory master switch activated by both PRR and the effect of proinflammatory cytokines [37] . The uptake of cholesterol is at least in part counterbalanced by cholesterol efflux from the macrophages, which is mediated by the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters A1 and G1. These transporters mediate the transfer of cholesterol to a free apolipoprotein A1 or directly to high-density lipoproteins containing either apoA1 or apolipoprotein E (high-density lipoprotein (HDL)) [35, 38] . HDLs mediate the transport of cholesterol towards the liver, a process known as reverse cholesterol transportation. This mechanism, which is peculiar for innate immune cells, is critical to control cellular cholesterol metabolism thus linking the activity of HDL and its components with the immune inflammatory response [39] .Indeed, an imbalance between cholesterol uptake and efflux leads to intracytoplasmic accumulation of cholesteryl lipid droplets [35] . This ultimately leads to the formation of lipid-laden foam cells, the hallmark of atherosclerosis [40] . The progression of cellular cholesterol loading leads to the triggering of an unfolded protein response in the endoplasmic reticulum, which brings cellular dysfunction. Cholesterol might precipitate within the cell as crystals and activate the inflammasome; this might lead to programmed cellular death, i.e., apoptosis or eventually necrosis [41] . Apoptosis and secondary necrosis lead to the development of an atherosclerotic necrotic core within the arterial lesion [42] . The necrotic core is mainly composed of cellular debris, [43] and lipid material [44] and therefore is highly thrombogenic. It is separated from the bloodstream by a fibrous cap. A discontinuation or rupture of the fibrous cap initiates a process of intraluminal thrombosis leading eventually to acute events including acute coronary syndromes or stroke. The rupture of the fibrous cap appears to be more likely when it is thinner or eventually infiltrated by foam cells [45] .Recent data suggested that lipid loading may begin even in circulating monocytes, which develop a foamy monocyte phenotype and subsequently migrate into the nascent atherosclerotic plaque. [46] Interestingly, the impairment of reverse cholesterol transportation, indirectly evaluated with serum cholesterol acceptor capacity, was shown to be associated to an increase in terms of cardiovascular death, nonfatal AMI, nonfatal stroke, or coronary revascularization at 9.4 years in a free living population of 2924 otherwise healthy subjects [47] . More recent data confirmed that serum cholesterol acceptor capacity, measured using cholesterol-loaded human THP-1 macrophages and patients' serum as a cellular cholesterol acceptor, is a strong independent determinant of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In a recent report on 1609 patients suffering from acute coronary syndrome, cholesterol efflux was significantly lower in subjects who died at 1.9 years of follow-up, despite comparable levels of HDL cholesterol. Indeed, serum cholesterol acceptor capacity was associated with in-hospital survival (hazard ratio (HR): 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.40 to 0.97, p = 0 038) and lower 30-day mortality (HR: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.13 to 0.78, p = 0 012) after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors [48] .", "citance": "Lineage-tracing studies have indeed found that peripheral proliferation of macrophages is the dominant mechanism for macrophage increase in atherosclerotic lesions [34] .", "claims": [{"text": "Peripheral proliferation of macrophages is the dominant mechanism for macrophage increase in atherosclerotic lesions.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

The study was conducted in a London teaching hospital's 22-bedded general ICU. The sampling periods were 28 weeks before and 2, 10, 25 and 37 weeks after introduction of CPOE. The unit pharmacist prospectively recorded details of MEs and the total number of drugs prescribed daily during the data collection periods, during the course of his normal chart review.ResultsThe total proportion of MEs was significantly lower with CPOE (117 errors from 2429 prescriptions, 4.8%) than with HWP (69 errors from 1036 prescriptions, 6.7%) (p < 0.04). The proportion of errors reduced with time following the introduction of CPOE (p < 0.001). Two errors with CPOE led to patient harm requiring an increase in length of stay and, if administered, three prescriptions with CPOE could potentially have led to permanent harm or death. Differences in the types of error between systems were noted. There was a reduction in major/moderate patient outcomes with CPOE when non-intercepted and intercepted errors were combined (p = 0.01). The mean baseline APACHE II score did not differ significantly between the HWP and the CPOE periods (19.4 versus 20.0, respectively, p = 0.71).ConclusionIntroduction of CPOE was associated with a reduction in the proportion of MEs and an improvement in the overall patient outcome score (if intercepted errors were included). Moderate and major errors, however, remain a significant concern with CPOE.", "citation_paragraph": "This study was designed to investigate the impact of CPOE, without decision support, on MEs in the critical care setting. The data collected were viewed in terms of proportion of errors, patient outcomes arising from the error and types of error.The proportion of MEs reduced following the introduction of CPOE. There was also some evidence that a learning curve occurred with CPOE, as the proportion of errors appeared to decline over time. This learning curve could have included improvements made to the system in light of experience, although it is conceivable that the ME rate may have reduced by itself over time. The error rates found were less than those reported in a recent study of prescription errors in UK critical care units [12] . There was no difference in the mean APACHE II score in the HWP and CPOE periods, indicating that it is unlikely that severity of illness differed substantially in the monitored periods.It was decided to separate the recording of non-intercepted and intercepted errors (where an error was spotted and corrected before having an impact on the patient). The intercepted errors were scored on the basis of what might have occurred if the patient received the medication as prescribed.There was a demonstrated benefit on patient outcome scores with CPOE prescribing when the intercepted errors were combined with the non-intercepted errors. It was reassuring to note that no patients suffered permanent harm or death as a result of any non-intercepted error. Three errors, which all occurred with CPOE, could have led to permanent harm or death had they been administered as prescribed. This CPOE system lacks the ability to effectively deal with drugs with variable dosage regimens such as vancomycin, gentamicin and warfarin. In addition, our impression is that prescribers often prescribed too quickly and made mistakes when using pulldown menus, as seen with the diamorphine error. A lack of product knowledge probably led to the amphotericin error. Prescribers need to develop a thorough, systematic approach to prescribing, similar to that which they employ for diagnosis. This aspect of our findings is in accordance with a recent study that identified that a CPOE system frequently increased the probability of prescribing errors [13] .Most of the errors were defined as 'minor' in outcome and, as such, did not cause the patient harm but, in some cases, may have lead to an increase in monitoring but with no change in vital signs. There were four errors, however, that caused either patient harm or increased monitoring and 34 intercepted errors that could have potentially caused harm had they been administered. The fact that these MEs were rectified before they harmed the patient underlines the value of daily prescription review by an experienced clinical pharmacist [14, 15] . In contrast to other views [8] , it was decided not to regard abbreviated drug names as errors, because this would have distorted the results in favour of CPOE. In justification of this treatment of the results, no abbreviated drug name led to a patient receiving the wrong drug, but it is regarded as poor prescribing practice as defined by our own prescribing guidelines and national guidelines [16] . CPOE effectively eradicated the use of abbreviations.The study was not designed or powered to identify differences in the types of errors under the two systems. Future work should be designed to focus on these differences. Omission of key prescription details such as dose, units, frequency and signatures appeared to be much reduced with CPOE, as the computer program did not permit drug entry with missing key data entry fields. Dose errors were still prevalent with CPOE, however, as a result of physicians choosing the wrong drug template, selecting from multiple options, or as a consequence of constructing their own drug prescriptions using pull down menus.There were also many missed prescribers' signatures with CPOE. This did not affect the patient but, in these cases, nurses administered medication without a legally valid physician order. Although an absent 'signature' with CPOE was regarded as an error, the audit facility of the Clinical Information System did record who prescribed the drug. There were several cases where necessary drugs were not prescribed with CPOE; this was probably not related specifically to the prescribing system.The categories described were specific to the setting and systems, thus a general taxonomy of medication errors [17] was not used as it was considered that this did not adequately characterise the errors. The categories used here specifically describe the event and general taxonomies were considered to be too broad to provide a specific and useful description of the episode.During the data collection period, key staff such as consultants, senior nurses and the pharmacist remained the same, so this did not influence the results. Pharmacist attendance at ward rounds has been associated with a reduction in adverse events [15] . In this study the pharmacist attended the ward round throughout the study. No other significant organisational changes occurred during the study period. The only possible changes were the junior medical staff who did change during the study and this may have affected the results. Ideally, the impact of this could be minimised by sampling over a longer period and more frequently, but this was beyond the scope and resources of this study. Alternatively, we could have statistically adjusted for experience level, although this is a difficult issue and has not been attempted by other researchers. Furthermore, the MEs recorded were all proactively identified from the daily pharmacist prescription chart review, and thus did not rely on the notoriously low reporting of multi-disciplinary adverse incident reports. Patient outcome was assessed by the pharmacist and clinical director, who were not blinded to the prescribing system; this could have introduced the potential for bias in the results and is a limitation of the study.Medical errors are among the leading causes of death in the United States. In its highly publicised report, the Institute of Medicine estimates that between 44,000 and 98,000 Americans die as a result of medical errors each year, with the majority of these errors being preventable [18] . MEs are the leading type of medical error [3] . Previously, in a setting that included general wards and ICUs, a similar type of CPOE was associated with a halving of the rate of non-intercepted MEs [19] ; ours is the first study identified that investigates the impact of CPOE on MEs solely in an adult ICU. CPOE is already the subject of considerable interest [20] and has already shown benefits in paediatric medicine [21] [22] [23] . A systematic review of the impact of clinical decision support systems (CDSS) [6] has demonstrated statistically significant improvements in antibiotic-associated MEs or adverse drug events and an improvement in theophylline-associated MEs, while several studies have shown non-significant results. CDSS is worthy of future study in the adult ICU in order to build on the experience gained from the limited CDSS system used in a mixed ICU and general ward setting [19] .", "citance": "Pharmacist attendance at ward rounds has been associated with a reduction in adverse events [15] .", "claims": [{"text": "Pharmacist attendance at ward rounds increases adverse events in wards.", "subject": "Adverse events in wards", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Pharmacist attendance at ward rounds reduces adverse events in wards.

{"s2orc_id": 20161222, "title": "Comparative analysis of de novo assemblers for variation discovery in personal genomes", "abstract": "Current variant discovery approaches often rely on an initial read mapping to the reference sequence. Their effectiveness is limited by the presence of gaps, potential misassemblies, regions of duplicates with a high-sequence similarity and regions of high-sequence divergence in the reference. Also, mapping-based approaches are less sensitive to large INDELs and complex variations and provide little phase information in personal genomes. A few de novo assemblers have been developed to identify variants through direct variant calling from the assembly graph, micro-assembly and whole-genome assembly, but mainly for whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. We developed SGVar, a de novo assembly workflow for haplotype-based variant discovery from whole-exome sequencing (WES) data. Using simulated human exome data, we compared SGVar with five variation-aware de novo assemblers and with BWA-MEM together with three haplotype- or local de novo assembly-based callers. SGVar outperforms the other assemblers in sensitivity and tolerance of sequencing errors. We recapitulated the findings on whole-genome and exome data from a Utah residents with Northern and Western European ancestry (CEU) trio, showing that SGVar had high sensitivity both in the highly divergent human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region and in non-HLA regions of chromosome 6. In particular, SGVar is robust to sequencing error, k-mer selection, divergence level and coverage depth. Unlike mapping-based approaches, SGVar is capable of resolving long-range phase and identifying large INDELs from WES, more prominently from WGS. We conclude that SGVar represents an ideal platform for WES-based variant discovery in highly divergent regions and across the whole genome.", "citation_paragraph": "Complete and accurate detection of sequence variations is a key prerequisite for deciphering the genetic etiology of disease [1, 2] . Mapping-based approaches currently dominate the field of variant discovery through whole-genome sequencing (WGS) or whole-exome sequencing (WES), but with limitations in several key aspects. First, the human reference sequence is not perfect [3] , containing misassemblies [4] and gaps [5] . In addition, some regions show high-sequence divergence or complex structural variations between haplotypes, or represent recent duplications with high-sequence similarity, causing ambiguity in short-read mapping [6, 7] . The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium estimated 171 Mb (5.5%) of the human genome reference GRCh37 as being inaccessible to the short-read sequencing technologies and mapping algorithms [8] , including 130 Mb of recent segmental duplications between which a reliable differentiation is often difficult [9] . Importantly, some of the missing, highly divergent and inaccessible regions are associated with human disease [2] . Current standard practice is less effective in variation discovery from these regions [2] . For example, a recent study revealed that mapping bias led to 19% error rate in assigning single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes for five critical genes in human leukocyte antigen (HLA), a highly divergent region associated with over 100 diseases [10] .Also, mapping efficiency often biases toward the reference allele in the presence of INDELs [6] , reducing the detection of INDELs, especially large ones and those located within microsatellites [11, 12] . Even though numerous tools have been developed specifically for INDEL detection, an initial read mapping is still needed [13] . Finally, phasing facilitates the inference of causal mutations, as haplotype structure provides pertinent information as to whether two or more deleterious variants are located on the same allele [14] . In organ transplantation, phase information is useful for predicting the donor-recipient match [15] . Nevertheless, current mapping-based approaches report only unphased genotypes or limited phasing information from local de novo assembly-based callers. Without genotype information from trio or reference population, it will be difficult to infer haplotype and uncover transmitted variants in personal genomes.The variation-aware de novo assemblers represent an attractive alternative. In principle, they are similar to the consensus sequence assemblers through the implementation of either de Bruijn graph [3] or string graph [4, 16] . In de Bruijn graph-based assembly paradigm, reads are split into substrings of length k called k-mers that are often error-corrected before used to build contigs. Thus, the performance of an assembler is correlated with the k-mer coverage rather than the base coverage, which highlights the importance of selecting appropriate k-mers, especially in cases when long reads are used. In string graph-based assembly, contigs represent paths of string graph built from overlapped reads. In this way, read coherence is fully retained in string graph but lost in de Bruijn graph. Most importantly, there is a key distinction between variation-aware and consensus sequence assemblers when applied to non-haploid organisms. While the former tries to preserve heterozygotes at polymorphic sites, the latter collapses them into consensus bases [17] .The variation-aware assemblers are capable of assembling reads into haplotype contigs [18] , facilitating the identification of long INDELs and structural variations [2, 4, 12, 19] . In fact, a few packages have been developed for direct variant calling from the graph [3] , local assembly (micro-assembly) using mapped reads [1, 12] , or whole-genome de novo assembly [4, 20, 21] .Cortex is the first de novo assembly-based algorithm for direct variant calling from short reads. Cortex implements colored de Bruijn graph for single-or multi-sample variant calling, using the reference sequence if available [3] . In the graph, the nodes and edges are colored by the samples having them, thus allowing population-based variant discovery. Variants are called directly from the graph through the function 'bubble-calling' (for simple variants) or 'path-divergence calling' (for complex variants). However, the current version has a low sensitivity, with nearly 40% false-negative rate [1] .The String Graph Assembler (SGA) was originally developed for consensus sequence assembly of large genomes [16] . It creates overlapping graphs by first performing Burrows-Wheeler Transform and Ferragina-Manzini (FM) indexing of reads [16] . With the implementation of such a data structure, SGA can efficiently compute the path of string graph in large genomes, alleviating the requirement of high computing, a limitation inherent to string graph [22] . The 'graph-diff' module, a supplement to the SGA package, provides two modes to call variants directly from string graph and de Bruijn graph, respectively. However, the efficiency of this development version has yet to be assessed.Scalpel [12] and DISCOVAR [1] perform local assembly based on de Bruijn graph. Reads are first mapped to the genome reference, and pairs with at least one mapped read are selected. Scalpel was designed solely for INDEL detection from WGS or WES data [12] . DISCOVAR was developed for assembling longer (250 bp) reads from WGS of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-free libraries; its error correction and variant detection algorithms might not work well on the typical shorter (76-150 bp) reads that are often generated from libraries involving PCR amplification [1] . Importantly, their performance in highly divergent regions remains unknown.Finally, Fermi and FermiKit (fermi2) are string graph-based whole-genome assemblers. Fermi implements FerraginaManzini DNA (FMD) index, a variety of FM index used in SGA, for forward-backward extension of DNA sequences [4] . It outputs unitigs that preserve SNPs, short INDELs and structural variations, without subsequent unitig mapping and variant calling. FermiKit is an updated version of Fermi [20] , which uses the BFC algorithm [23] for less greedy error correction compared with the k-mer frequency used by Fermi, BWA-MEM [24] for mapping unitigs to the reference and HTSBox (https://github. com/lh3/htsbox) for variant detection. Nevertheless, both versions lack the flexibility needed for tweaking parameters when applied to WES or targeted gene panel sequencing data.Except for Scalpel that was designed exclusively for INDEL detection in WES and WGS [12] , the other packages described above were developed for WGS. Unlike in WGS, de novo assembly of WES data is complicated by the variability in coverage because of capture, sequencing and mapping bias [7, 25, 26] . De novo assembly of WES in complex regions is particularly challenging. Short-read assembly often implements de Bruijn graph, a data structure tending to be less effective compared with string graph when complex regions are assembled [27] .Understanding the advantages and limitations of individual methods is critical for optimizing variant discovery through de novo assembly. However, a detailed comparison of de novo assemblers is lacking in both WGS and WES. Using simulated exome data as well as real WES and WGS, we assessed SGVar, a chromosome-level de novo assembly pipeline we developed for haplotype-based variant discovery, along with five other de novo assembly-based and three mapping-based variant discovery methods. SGVar demonstrates excellence in both sensitivity and precision, which is largely independent of variability in coverage and divergence. SGVar can achieve long-range phasing over some of the most divergent HLA genes. It is powerful in detecting large INDELs, SNP clusters and complex structural variations.", "citance": "In organ transplantation, phase information is useful for predicting the donor-recipient match [15] .", "claims": [{"text": "Phase information is not predictive of donor-recipient matches in organ transplantation.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Phase information is useful for predicting donor-recipient matches in organ transplantation.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 13639207, "title": "Chromatin modifications and DNA repair: beyond double-strand breaks", "abstract": "DNA repair must take place in the context of chromatin, and chromatin modifications and DNA repair are intimately linked. The study of double-strand break repair has revealed numerous histone modifications that occur after induction of a DSB, and modification of the repair factors themselves can also occur. In some cases the function of the modification is at least partially understood, but in many cases it is not yet clear. Although DSB repair is a crucial activity for cell survival, DSBs account for only a small percentage of the DNA lesions that occur over the lifetime of a cell. Repair of single-strand gaps, nicks, stalled forks, alternative DNA structures, and base lesions must also occur in a chromatin context. There is increasing evidence that these repair pathways are also regulated by histone modifications and chromatin remodeling. In this review, we will summarize the current state of knowledge of chromatin modifications that occur during non-DSB repair, highlighting similarities and differences to DSB repair as well as remaining questions.", "citation_paragraph": "Postreplication mismatch repair (MMR) is initiated when a base mismatch escapes the DNA polymerase proofreading machinery. In human cells, MMR is regulated by histone H3-K36 trimethylation ( Figure 1F ). H3-K36me3 is required in vivo to recruit the heterodimer MSH2-MSH6 (MutS\u03b1) to chromatin through the Pro-Trp-Trp-Pro (PWWP) domain of MSH6, a domain that specifically interacts with H3-K36me3 . Since H3-K36me3 is abundant during G1 and early S phase, it is thought that this ensures the enrichment of MutS\u03b1 on DNA during the period when mismatches are likely to arise. Cells that lack the H3-K36 trimethyltransferase SETD2 have altered MSH6 localization and a mutator phenotype, but are not defective in MMR in vitro . Whether additional histone modifications are involved in MMR is as yet unknown; good candidates may be those associated with the progression of DNA replication, such as H3-K56 (Kadyrova et al., 2013) .Because nucleosomes become disassembled in front of a replication fork, newly replicated DNA is relatively nucleosomepoor and MMR may not need robust chromatin remodeling to effectively compete with nucleosomes. However, fully formed nucleosomes have been observed about 250 bp from a replication fork, and there are intermediates in the assembly process in the region in between (Sogo et al., 1986; Jackson, 1988) . Therefore, the MMR machinery is likely to encounter some completely formed nucleosomes in addition to nucleosome intermediates. There is some evidence for interaction between MMR factors and the histone H3-H4 chaperone chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1). Mismatch correction reactions with HeLa cell extracts demonstrated that replication error correction occurs on DNA that is packaged into nucleosomes by CAF-1 (Kadyrova et al., 2011) . However, in a combined in vitro MMR and nucleosome assembly assay, a mismatch in a nicked plasmid substrate delayed loading of nucleosomes in a human cell extract (Sch\u00f6pf et al., 2012) , suggesting that MMR interferes with nucleosome assembly. The balance between MMR and chromatin reassembly may be regulated by a physical interaction between MutS\u03b1, specifically MSH6, and the p150 subunit of CAF-1 (Sch\u00f6pf et al., 2012) .In addition to these interactions between MMR and chromatin assembly factors, passive chromatin remodeling assists the MMR process. Using in vitro experiments with reconstituted nucleosomes and purified human proteins, the MMR initiation heterodimer MutS\u03b1 disassembles nucleosomes (Javaid et al., 2009) . Nucleosome remodeling by MutS\u03b1 required a mismatch and translocation of the complex as a sliding clamp along the DNA (Javaid et al., 2009) . The nucleosome remodeling function required ATP binding but not hydrolysis, suggesting that the remodeling function is passive. Histone H3 acetylation or an H3 acetylation mimic (H3-K115Ac, H3-K122Ac, H3-K56Q), enhanced the remodeling function of MutS\u03b1 (Javaid et al., 2009) . Additionally, phosphorylation of histone H3-T118 enhanced nucleosome disassembly by MutS\u03b1 by 25-fold in vitro (North et al., 2011) . However, no in vivo investigation has been done yet to support a role for H3 phosphorylation or acetylation in MMR. There is also evidence that passive MutS\u03b1-dependent nucleosome disassembly may not be sufficient, as human MutS\u03b1 bound poorly to a substrate with a mismatch within a nucleosome ). In addition, nucleosomes blocked ATP-induced sliding of MutS\u03b1 along the DNA when there was a mismatch between two nucleosomes ). Overall, these findings indicate that nucleosomes likely inhibit the MMR process to some degree, and active remodeling may yet be found to play a role in MMR.", "citance": "Additionally, phosphorylation of histone H3-T118 enhanced nucleosome disassembly by MutS\u03b1 by 25-fold in vitro (North et al., 2011) .", "claims": [{"text": "Phosphorylation of histone H3-T118 enhanced nucleosome disassembly by MutS\u03b1 by 25-fold in vitro", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Phosphorylation of histone H3-T118 enhanced nucleosome disassembly by the heterodimer MSH2-MSH6 (MutS\u03b1) by 25-fold in vitro.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Phosphorylation of histone H3-T118 reduced nucleosome disassembly by the heterodimer MSH2-MSH6 (MutS\u03b1) by 25-fold in vitro.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Phosphorylation of histone H3-T118 reduced the rate of nucleosome disassembly by MutS\u03b1 in vitro.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}
{"s2orc_id": 195697033, "title": "The mechanistic basis for chromatin regulation by pioneer transcription factors", "abstract": null, "citation_paragraph": "As the second step of pioneering activity, pioneer factors locally open chromatin structure and create a permissive state for gene regulation. In contrast to the chromatin binding step, the molecular mechanisms underlying the chromatin opening step remain to be determined for most pioneer factors.The chromatin opening that follows FoxA binding does not require ATP or ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers (Cirillo et al., 2002 ), but we cannot rule out the possibility that chromatin remodelers are recruited to FoxA pioneering sites for further chromatin remodeling. A FoxA2 ChIP-exo-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation with lambda exonuclease digestion followed by sequencing) experiment in adult mouse livers identified FoxA2 binding sites in single nucleotide resolution throughout the genome and revealed that FoxA2 binding events were enriched near the dyad axis (center) of the nucleosome . Interestingly, the \"winged helix\" DNA-binding domain of FoxA structurally resembles the globular, nucleosomal binding domain of linker histones (Clark et al., 1993; Ramakrishnan et al., 1993) , and linker histones also bind near the dyad axis of the nucleosome (Goytisolo et al., 1996) . in vitro biochemical and in vivo knockout studies indicate that FoxA binding locally displaces linker histones from the closed chromatin and keeps the nucleosome accessible (Cirillo et al., 1998; Iwafuchi-Doi et al., 2016) , providing a simple explanation for the underlying nucleosomes becoming more accessible. Furthermore, the C-terminal domain of FoxA interacts directly with core histone proteins and is required for opening chromatin (Cirillo et al., 2002) . The interaction with core histones could stabilize FoxA binding and enhance the displacement of linker histones. Similarly, a C-terminal domain of EBF1, a key transcription factor for B cell programming, is required for chromatin opening at the majority of EBF1-inducible DNase-hypersensitive sites (Boller et al., 2016) . It remains to be determined whether the C-terminal domain of EBF1 directly interacts with chromatin or coregulatory factors for chromatin opening. These studies demonstrate the role of non-DNA-binding domains in pioneering activity.As many transcription factors function by recruiting transcriptional coregulatory complexes, including chromatin remodelers, some pioneer factors can recruit chromatin remodelers and open chromatin structure. Large-scale proteomic studies indicate that the pioneer factor OCT3/4 interacts with major chromatin remodeling factors (Ding, Xu, Faiola, Ma'ayan, & Wang, 2012; Pardo et al., 2010; van den Berg et al., 2010) . A genetics and genomics study shows that OCT3/4 recruits the chromatin remodeler BRG1 (SMARCA4) and establishes accessible chromatin structure in pluripotent stem cells (King & Klose, 2017) . The linker between the two Oct3/4 DNA-binding domains (Pou-specific and Pou-homeodomain) functions as a proteinprotein interaction interface with BRG1 and is required for the reprogramming activity of Oct3/4 (Esch et al., 2013) . More pioneer factors, such as Sox2, p63, Gata, and AP-1, have also been reported to recruit chromatin remodelers to their target sites (Bao et al., 2015; Engelen et al., 2011; Hu et al., 2011; Takaku et al., 2016; Vierbuchen et al., 2017) . Further studies are required to determine the extent to which chromatin opening activity relies on the support of chromatin remodelers and whether the pioneer factors have the intrinsic ability to open chromatin by themselves as FoxA does.", "citance": "Large-scale proteomic studies indicate that the pioneer factor OCT3/4 interacts with major chromatin remodeling factors (Ding, Xu, Faiola, Ma'ayan, & Wang, 2012; Pardo et al., 2010; van den Berg et al., 2010) .", "claims": [{"text": "Pioneer factor OCT3/4 interacts with major chromatin remodeling factors.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "There is no known interaction between Pioneer factor OCT3/4 and major chromatin remodeling factors.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}

No Caption available. Abstract The glucagon\u2010like peptide 1 receptor (GLP\u20101R) can be activated by a number of endogenous peptide hormones, including extended, processed, glycine extended and carboxy\u2010terminally amidated versions of glucagon\u2010like peptide 1 (GLP\u20101). While the main focus of the literature has been on the processed, amidated form, GLP\u20101(7\u201036)NH2, the other forms of this peptide are likely to be secreted in physiologically relevant amounts under certain circumstances. This study builds on our existing work examining the effect of mutation of conserved transmembrane polar residues within the receptor to understand the nature of binding and pleiotropic signaling in response to these alternatively processed versions of this important incretin hormone. We show that extended and processed peptides differ not only in their binding to the receptor but also in the way the receptor is engaged for activation that leads to differential signaling bias exhibited by these peptides.", "citation_paragraph": "The glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) is an important target for the treatment of type-2 diabetes (T2DM). Activation of the GLP-1R on pancreatic \u03b2-islets results in a glucose dependent increase in insulin secretion, which is important for controlling circulating glucose levels [1, 2] . In animal models GLP-1R activation produces an increase in \u03b2-cell mass and improved \u03b2-cell function [3] [4] [5] . The GLP-1R is also present in both the peripheral and central nervous systems and activation of neuronal GLP-1R results in a reduction in gastric motility, a decrease in feeding behavior (due to both reduced appetite and increased satiety in humans), a decrease in hepatic glucose production, an increase in thermogenesis in brown adipose along with a decrease in white lipogenesis (reviewed in [2] ). There have also been reports that GLP-1R activation in the cardiovascular system is cardio-protective [6] [7] [8] [9] and that its activation in the central nervous system can mitigate some of the cognitive decline observed in patients with long term T2DM [10] . These pleiotropic roles of GLP-1R, in the context of the T2DM metabolic syndrome, have led to the development of injectable GLP-1 mimetics such as Exenatide and Liraglutide.The GLP-1R is a class B, G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR); a therapeutically important class of receptors that are activated by peptide ligands. They share a common topology with a large extracellular domain, stabilized by 3 conserved disulphide bonds and a 7 transmembrane helix bundle. The GLP-1R has several endogenous ligands that include 4 forms of GLP-1 (GLP-1(1-37), GLP-1(1-36)NH 2 , GLP-1(7-37), GLP-1(7-37)NH 2 and oxyntomodulin [11] that arise from posttranslational processing of the proglucagon gene. The preproglucagon peptide is processed by prohormone converting enzyme 1 and/or 3 (PC1/3) to form the peptides GLP-1, GLP-2, oxyntomodulin, glucagon and glicentin [12] [13] [14] [15] . It is unclear what proportion of GLP-1(1-37) is processed into GLP-1(1-36)NH 2 , GLP-1(7-36)NH 2 and GLP-1(7-37), however the majority of secreted GLP-1 from L cells in response to a rise in blood glucose levels is GLP-1(7-36)NH 2 and to a lesser extent GLP-1(7-37). There is currently no data demonstrating which enzyme(s) are responsible for processing of the extended (1-37) and (1-36)NH 2 to form the truncated (7-37) and 1(7-36)NH 2 forms. However, older data indicates that both truncated forms of GLP-1 are present in plasma at roughly equimolar concentrations in the fasted state [16] , suggesting differing physiological roles for these peptides. There is an enduring debate in the literature regarding production of various forms of GLP-1 in pancreatic \u03b1-cells and if so whether any of these forms are secreted.On balance, there appear to be conditions, such as elevated circulating glucose levels, pancreatic islet damage and systemic inflammation under which a subset of islet \u03b1-cells upregulate PC1/3 to produce and secrete small amounts of unprocessed GLP-1. These extended forms of GLP-1 have little effect on pancreatic insulin secretion and while their function is still largely unknown, there are several reports demonstrating that these are biologically active. GLP-1(1-37), acting via GLP-1R, has been shown to inhibit chemokine dependent CD4+ T-cell migration [17] , which may have implications for vascular inflammation in type II diabetic patients. GLP-1(1-37) treatment of mouse embryonic intestinal epithelial cells leads to conversion of a subset of these cells to an insulin secreting phenotype, in an apparent GLP-1R dependent manner [18] , which may imply a developmental role for this extended peptide. There is also data showing this extended peptide has in vivo glucose lowering efficacy in mice [19] , although this is unlikely to be via pancreatic actions. Recent publications have pointed to secretion of extended forms of GLP-1 [17] [18] [19] and, separately, have shown that physiological, neuronal GLP-1R activation is due to local release of GLP-1R agonists in the central nervous system [20] [21] [22] . Overall the physiology of these extended peptides is underexplored, however there is sufficient data pointing to roles of these peptides outside the typical pancreatic actions of GLP-1(7-36)NH 2 that more research is required. Analogous to all GPCRs, the GLP-1R transduces signals from the outside of the cell to the inside by allosterically converting a ligandbinding event to activation of intracellular effectors. The GLP-1R couples to several intracellular effectors and this pleiotropic coupling is physiologically relevant and can lead to biased agonism, whereby distinct ligands can promote distinct profiles of cellular signaling [23] . Moreover, our previous work reveals that extended GLP-1 peptides are biased agonists at the GLP-1R relative to fully processed peptides, with higher relative efficacy for signaling pathways such as ERK1/2 phosphorylation and limited ability to promote calcium mobilization [24] [25] [26] . GLP-1R activation leading to intracellular signaling relies on a series of polar transmembrane networks within the receptor. Our previous work highlighted that differential engagement of these networks by endogenous ligands, GLP-1(7-36)NH 2 and oxyntomodulin and the exogenous ligand exendin-4 may contribute to their observed biased agonism [27] [28] [29] . Here, we extend this work to understand whether GLP-1R engagement by extended GLP-1 or processed GLP-1 peptides results in similar patterns of receptor activation and how this links to differential signaling profiles of these ligands.", "citance": "The GLP-1R couples to several intracellular effectors and this pleiotropic coupling is physiologically relevant and can lead to biased agonism, whereby distinct ligands can promote distinct profiles of cellular signaling [23] .", "claims": [{"text": "Pleiotropic coupling of GLP-1R to intracellular effectors inhibit distinct profiles of cellular signaling.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Pleiotropic coupling of GLP-1R to intracellular effectors promotes distinct profiles of cellular signaling.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 177500, "title": "Genetic causes of proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome: Impact on podocyte pathobiology", "abstract": "In the past 20 years, multiple genetic mutations have been identified in patients with congenital nephrotic syndrome (CNS) and both familial and sporadic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Characterization of the genetic basis of CNS and FSGS has led to the recognition of the importance of podocyte injury to the development of glomerulosclerosis. Genetic mutations induce injury due to effects on the podocyte\u2019s structure, actin cytoskeleton, calcium signaling, and lysosomal and mitochondrial function. Transgenic animal studies have contributed to our understanding of podocyte pathobiology. Podocyte endoplasmic reticulum stress response, cell polarity, and autophagy play a role in maintenance of podocyte health. Further investigations related to the effects of genetic mutations on podocytes may identify new pathways for targeting therapeutics for nephrotic syndrome.", "citation_paragraph": "Following the discovery of the role of NPHS1 and NPHS2, mutations in actin cytoskeleton-associated genes (CD2AP, ACTN4, MYO1E, INF2, ARHGDIA) were identified in patients with nephrotic syndrome [33] [34] [35] . How do defects in actin cytoskeleton regulation lead to podocyte injury? One possibility is they may impair the ability of podocyte foot processes to respond to the dynamic changes in the pressure and shape of the capillary walls. In vivo fluorescent imaging of podocytes suggests that podocytes are motile and migrate in the presence of injury [6] . Altered podocyte motility and decreased adhesion could induce detachment from the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and eventually podocyte loss [36] .CD2AP is an 80-kDa cytoplasmic adaptor protein originally identified as a ligand interacting with the T-cell-adhesion protein CD2 [37] . In podocytes, CD2AP serves as a linker that anchors NPHS1 and NPHS2 to the actin cytoskeleton [19, 38] . In addition, CD2AP binds other regulators of the actin cytoskeleton. Cell motility requires the formation of projections of the actin cytoskeleton, known as lamellipodia. CD2AP recruits actin capping proteins to cortactin in the cortical actin cytoskeleton, promoting lamellipodia formation [39] . CD2AP also binds synaptopodin (SYNPO), an alphaactin binding protein that promotes the formation of unbranched actin filaments and is required for actin remodeling [40, 41] . In addition to its effects on the actin cytoskeleton, CD2AP deletion induces podocyte injury and apoptosis through the upregulation of transforming growth factor beta [42] . CD2AP \u2212/\u2212 mice develop early onset, severe nephrotic syndrome, while CD2AP +/\u2212 (heterozygous) mice develop FSGS-like lesions at 9 months [43, 44] . CD2AP mutations may be rare in humans; to date, only a few heterozygous CD2AP mutations linked to FSGS [35, 44, 45] and one case of homozygous CD2AP mutations in infantile form of nephrotic syndrome have been reported [46] . Alpha-4-actinin (ACTN4) is a 100-kDa actin-binding protein that belongs to the spectrin gene superfamily. ACTN4 forms cross-links between actin filaments and binds adhesion molecules alpha-1-integrin and vinculin. Missense mutations in ACTN4 are associated with incompletely penetrant and lateonset autosomal dominant (AD) FSGS [33] . Mutations in ACTN4 are relatively rare, accounting for only approximately 4 % of familial FSGS [47] . The identified mutations result in non-conservative amino acid substitutions affecting the ACTN4 binding domain. Mutant ACTN4 exhibits increased binding to filamentous actin in vitro compared with wild-type protein, and the mutant protein formed aggregates within the podocyte, impairing podocyte migration in vitro [48, 49] .In addition to effects on the actin cytoskeleton, mutant ACTN4 may have other deleterious effects on the podocyte. Transgenic \"knock-in\" mice that express K255E mutant ACTN4 develop FSGS lesions and demonstrate activation of the ER stress response [50, 51] . The ER is a network of membrane-enclosed tubes (cisternae). Proteins are synthesized on ribosomes attached to the ER, and the ER is enriched in chaperones that help the nascent proteins fold. These chaperones, such as GRP78/BIP, have dual roles, as they also regulate the cell's response to stress (reviewed in [52] ). In the absence of stress, members of the unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling cascade [including inositol-requiring kinase 1 (IRE1a), PRKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6)] are bound and inhibited by GRP78/BIP [52] . Accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER sequesters GRP78/BIP and releases this inhibition. Mis-folded proteins are also targeted for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Back-up (or \"choking\") of the ubiquitin-proteosome system with misfolded proteins further activates the UPR. Early on, activation of UPR elements leads to the global suppression of mRNA transcription and cell cycle arrest. This is likely to be an adaptive response to enable the cell to recover. However, continued UPR activation leads to p38 MAPK phosphorylation and increased expression of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and BIM [52] . These proteins are pro-apoptotic and can induce cell death. The K255E mutant ACTN4 causes \"choking\" of the ubiquitin-protesome system and activation of the UPR signaling pathways [51] . Thus, mutant ACTN4 may also induce podocyte injury via ER stress.Two mutations (A159P and Y695X) in MYO1E, the gene encoding non-muscle class I myosin, myosin 1E, have been associated with childhood-onset autosomal-recessive FSGS [53] . MYO1E is a member of the actin-dependent motor proteins. Myosins are bound to actin and generate force by hydrolysis of ATP to ADP, leading to a conformational change that stimulates movement of the actin filaments. Like other myosins, the N-terminus of MYO1E has an actin-binding domain and ATPase [54] . In addition to binding actin, MYO1E localizes to the slit diaphragm via interactions with ZO1, a cell-cell junction protein that can form a complex with slit diaphragm components [54] . MYO1E is required for the organization of podocyte actin filaments along cell-cell contacts. In one study, cultured podocytes expressing mutant A159P MYO1E failed to organize actin filaments at cell-cell junctions [54] , and in another study, knockdown of MYO1E led to impaired podocyte adhesion and podocyte detachment in vitro [55] . In sum, MYO1E mutations impact both the assembly of the actin cytoskeleton and cell-cell adhesion, likely leading to podocyte injury and loss.INF2 encodes inverted formin 2 (INF2), a member of the diaphanous formin subfamily of actin-regulating proteins (mDias). mDias are effectors for RHOA signaling. RHOA, CDC42, and RAC belong to the RHO family of GTPases that regulate the actin cytoskeleton and modulate cell shape, motility, adhesion, polarity, cell cycle, and transcription. A delicate balance of RHOA, RAC, and CDC42 signaling is required in podocytes, and excess RHOA activation induces podocyte injury and FSGS lesions in mice [56, 57] . When RHOA is bound by GTP, and it can bind and active mDias to stimulate actin polymerization. The mDias have formin homology domains that are the sites of actin nucleation and polymerization. They also have two regulatory domains: the diaphanous inhibitory domain (DID) and the diaphanous autoregulatory domain (DAD). In the absence of RHOA-GTP binding, the DID/DAD domains interact to inhibit actin polymerization. INF2 is homologous to mDias, and its DID domain can inhibit mDias and actin polymerization [58] . Thus, INF2 acts to fine-tune RHOA signaling. Loss of function disrupts the cortical actin network in cultured podocytes [58] .Most of the described mutations in INF2 are heterozygous missense variants clustered in exons 2-4, which code for the N-terminal DID of the protein [59] [60] [61] . INF2 mutations lead to loss of its inhibitory function and tip the balance towards mDia activation [58] . INF2 mutations account for up to 9-17 % of familial cases of AD FSGS but are rarely associated with the sporadic cases of FSGS [34, 59, 62, 63] . INF2 mutations have been also identified in individuals with FSGS and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease [64] .Mutations in ARHGDIA have recently been identified in an infant with CNS and in two siblings with early onset SRNS [65] . ARHGDIA regulates GDP/GTP binding to RHO GTPases. It can act as a regulatory switch by determining the proportion of RHO GTPases bound to GDP (inactive) versus GTP (active). In cultured podocytes, wild-type ARHGDIA binds RHOA, RAC, and CDC42 and inhibits cell migration [65] . Expression of the mutant ARHGDIA leads to increased RAC1 and CDC42 activity in vitro [65] . Taken together, data on the mutations in INF2 and ARHGDIA indicate the need for tight regulation of the actin cytoskeleton to maintain podocyte health.", "citance": "In vivo fluorescent imaging of podocytes suggests that podocytes are motile and migrate in the presence of injury [6] .", "claims": [{"text": "Podocytes are motile and migrate in the presence of injury.

{"s2orc_id": 11825787, "title": "The cultural history of wine - theoretical background to wine therapy", "abstract": "Abstract The knowledge of grape and wine is as old as the cultural history of mankind. Moderate consumption of wine can be beneficial in healthy individuals. It is also known from ancient times that it can cause acute and chronic damage when consumed in great quantities. The disinfectant effect of its use in ointments has been observed already in the antiquity. Polyphenols, among them resveratrol, have generated a great amount of scientific research due to their in vivo and in vitro antioxidant capabilities. For decades, red wine was thought to have beneficial effects on cardiovascular health. This relation was clearly established in the French Paradox phenomenon as well as in the Mediterranean diet. The French Paradox is defined as a low incidence of coronary heart disease, while consuming a diet rich in saturated fat. The cause of this phenomenon is the usually wine drinking in small quantity, supposingly in the consequence of polypenols in red wine. The use of ointments containing polyphenols of wine and the cosmetic treatments with them can be advantageous in the treatment and prevention of some diseases of the skin and the joints, due to its free radical scavenging effect. In healthy individuals the consumption of a moderate amount of 1 to 2 dl wine a day may reduce the mortality of cardiovascular diseases. However, also this quantity can be associated with detrimental effects in pregnant women, in children and in patients with various organic, particularly hepatic, diseases as well as in case of regular administration of certain medicines.", "citation_paragraph": "Wine therapy is essentially a new 'therapeutic' modality that has come into favour from France and is used in a few countries up to now. Basically the procedure is as follows: the person to be treated is laid into a well-prepared bathtub filled with a fluid devoid of alcohol but containing the other ingredients of wine (mainly polyphenols). Then massage is applied with ointments that contain oil obtained from grape pips by cold pressure, followed by a special compress with skins of the pressed grape. Cosmetic treatments are performed with ointments of polyphenols made of wine. All this is associated with a carefully prepared diet containing plenty of fruits, salads and fishes. Quality wines are offered to the meals in the above recommended small quantities. Of course, all these are accompanied by the natural environment of the institutes of such type and the friendly atmosphere of hospitality as external factors.As the most important part of wine therapy is comprised of the several polyphenoltype substances present in wine, we will deal with these in greater detail. The beneficial physiological effects of wine, especially red wine, are attributed to the polyphenol-type compounds originating from the grape. The presumptive mechanisms for the healthprotecting effect of polyphenol components of wine origin can be arranged around several biochemical reactions. One of their most essential and most extensively studied properties is their antioxidant and radical-scavenging effect. Several working groups reported the inhibitory effect of phenolic components of wine origin on LDL-oxidation. The oxidised LDL derivatives can be made responsible for the development of cells with foamy plasma in the first stage of arteriosclerosis. Polyphenols of the red wine probably are synergists of the tocopherol (Vitamin E) and ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), thus they inhibit lipid peroxidation -i.e. the enhanced oxidation of the lipids in cell membrane and cell constituents -and consequently the permeability of the membranes to a greater degree so that they prevent the rapid decay of the cells.In risk reduction of cardiac diseases due to vascular obstruction, the beneficial effect of the phenol components originated from wine may prevail via anticoagulant mechanisms as well. Polyphenols of the wine inhibit platelet and macrophage cyclooxigenase and lipoxigenase enzyme activity, thus making the process of coagulation slower. Through their radical-scavenging i.e. antioxidant properties they inhibit the damage of endothelial prostacyclin and endothelium-dependent relaxation factor caused by lipid peroxidation [36, 48, [54] [55] [56] .The alcohol content of red wines varies between 10 to 15%. Their compounds with antioxidant properties suffer little damage in the course of processing, and they contain no carcinogenic ingredients according to our current knowledge. Their appetising and digestive effects have been well-known for a long time. Owing to the alcohol content, polyphenol compounds can be easily absorbed through the alimentary tract [8, 49, 52] . The polyphenol contents of some wines commercially available in Hungary are shown in Figure 2 . It is important to note that not only the red but also white vines exert an influence on certain functions of the organism, such as on endothelial func tion of the vessels in the extremities in cardiovascular diseases [57] . Complex bilding capacity of some Hungarian wines based on our data are demonstrated in Figure 3 . Among the polyphenols the resveratrol has got a special effect on the different tissues and cells both in animals and human [58] . Its some specific molecular biologic effects are demonstrated in Table 1 together with the references [59] [60] [61] [62] . It is necessary to mention that other content of the food is very important in the reduction of cardiovascular mortality [63] . The polymeal nutrition [64] like the poly pill treatment is able to reduce the mortality rate by 76 percent (Figure 4 ). As demonstrated above, the polyphenol compounds of grape origin play an essential role in the beneficial effects of wines. Some wine-producing techniques offer a possibility for increasing the polyphenol content. Well known, polyphenol content of the red wines is substantially higher than that of the white ones; this follows from differences both in basic material and in wine-processing technology. The polyphenol content of wines can also be increased by adding components from other plants. Vermouths of excellent quality and pleasant aroma can be produced with extracts of herbs and spices or their mixtures. Vermouth occupies an intermediate position between dessert wines and liqueurs, and essentially it is an aromatised dessert wine with a bouquet dominated by the odour and flavour of absinth and other substances that give a bitter taste [65] .

{"s2orc_id": 863073, "title": "Whole body cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging to stratify symptomatic and asymptomatic atherosclerotic burden in patients with isolated cardiovascular disease", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to use whole body cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (WB CVMR) to assess the heart and arterial network in a single examination, so as to describe the burden of atherosclerosis and subclinical disease in participants with symptomatic single site vascular disease. 64 patients with a history of symptomatic single site vascular disease (38 coronary artery disease (CAD), 9 cerebrovascular disease, 17 peripheral arterial disease (PAD)) underwent whole body angiogram and cardiac MR in a 3 T scanner. The arterial tree was subdivided into 31 segments and each scored according to the degree of stenosis. From this a standardised atheroma score (SAS) was calculated. Cine and late gadolinium enhancement images of the left ventricle were obtained. Asymptomatic atherosclerotic disease with greater than 50 % stenosis in arteries other than that responsible for their presenting complain was detected in 37 % of CAD, 33 % of cerebrovascular and 47 % of PAD patients. Unrecognised myocardial infarcts were observed in 29 % of PAD patients. SAS was significantly higher in PAD patients 24 (17.5-30.5) compared to CAD 4 (2\u201311.25) or cerebrovascular disease patients 6 (2-10) (ANCOVA p < 0.001). Standardised atheroma score positively correlated with age (\u03b2 0.36 p = 0.002), smoking status (\u03b2 0.34 p = 0.002), and LV mass (\u03b2 -0.61 p = 0.001) on multiple linear regression. WB CVMR is an effective method for the stratification of cardiovascular disease. The high prevalence of asymptomatic arterial disease, and silent myocardial infarctions, particularly in the peripheral arterial disease group, demonstrates the importance of a systematic approach to the assessment of cardiovascular disease.", "citation_paragraph": "We have shown that whole body cardiovascular MRI is a feasible solution to stratify the extent of atherosclerosis in arteries and the extent of cardiac dysfunction and myocardial scarring in a 45-min exam. This is also the first study to show a positive correlation between the Stratified medicine has become a topic of increasing importance [21, 22] . This is as important in cardiovascular disease as it is in cancer, and requires accurate definition and quantification of disease. This is especially important given findings that polyvascular disease is associated with significantly higher rates for major adverse cardiovascular events than in single site vascular disease [23] . In our study we have demonstrated the ability of WB-MRA to stratify and quantify atherosclerotic burden throughout the body. Significant undetected arterial stenoses were found to be present in multiple sites in all disease groups. We found a 37 % prevalence Table 5 The percentage of patients in each group that have at least one vessel segments with (a) severe stenosis (MRA score = 3 or 4) and (b) moderate stenosis (MRA score = 2) for the different anatomical territories. The bracketed number is the total number of vessel segments with the relevant degree of stenosis (21) 56 (6) 88 (34) Head/Neck (%) 5.3 (4) 0 (0) 29.4 (8) 11 (4) 33 (3) 29 (7) Aorta (%) 0 (0) 0 (0) 5.9 (1) 3 (1) 0 (0) 6 (1) Abdomen (%) 7.9 (4) 11.1 (1) 52.9 (11) 18 (7) 0 (0) 12 (2) Ilio-Femoral (%) 10.5 (6) 0 (0) 76 (28) 8 (5) 11 (1) 59 (15) Run off (%) 18.4 (12) 22.2 (5) 58.8 (25) 8 (4) 22 (2) 41 (9) CAD coronary artery disease, CVD cerebrovascular disease, PAD peripheral arterial disease of extra-coronary arterial disease in CAD. This is lower than the 50 % reported in one study although this latter study did not exclude patients with known extracoronary disease [16] . It is also lower than the 55 % reported in a more recent study [12] , although this was performed at 1.5 T with a lower spatial resolution than obtained in the current study, thus the improved arterial definition may have led to a more accurate quantification of the degree of stenosis due to improved spatial resolution found at 3 T. We found that 33 % of cerebrovascular disease patients had significant disease outwith the head and neck. This is significantly lower than that reported by Paraskevas et al. [5] , however their study only looked at patients with known unilateral internal carotid artery occlusion which is at the extreme end of the carotid disease spectrum, while our study used prior cerebrovascular events as inclusion criteria. Our PAD cohort demonstrated significant disease above the level of the abdominal aortic bifurcation in 47 % which is slightly higher than that previously reported on WB-MRA [15] . The standardised atheroma score was significantly higher in the peripheral arterial disease group than either the cerebrovascular or the coronary arterial disease group. Previous epidemiological studies have shown that patients with PAD have a 33 % higher composite risk of CV death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospitalisation for atherothrombotic event(s) than either cerebrovascular or coronary arterial disease groups [24] . As well as the intrinsic risk of arterial stenosis, part of the causative mechanism may be the effect the atherosclerotic burden has on the heart. We have shown for the first time the association between whole body arterial atheroma burden and left ventricular mass, which is known to be strongly associated with future cardiovascular events [25] . This may be due to the stiffening nature of the atherosclerosis on the arteries, as total atheroma burden has been shown to correlate with arterial stiffness, [26] which in turn is associated with left ventricular hypertrophy [27] . Given that both left ventricular mass and atheroma burden are associated with increased future risk of cardiac events, further work is required to extricate the interaction between these measures, to ascertain whether these need to be targeted individually, or whether there is a single linking aetiology which can be targeted.Unrecognised myocardial infarctions are present in 29.4 % of patients with peripheral arterial disease. The rate in peripheral arterial disease patients is significantly higher than the 6 % reported in a previous PAD population using ECG and echocardiography during pre-operative work-up [28] , or the 14 % reported in a series of patients undergoing pre-operative coronary angiography screening [29] . However ECG has been shown to only detect 6-29 % of unrecognised myocardial infarcts revealed on late gadolinium enhancement [30, 31] . Our observed incidence is closer to that expected from a previous study looking at whole body cardiovascular MR in a population cohort study which showed rates of unrecognised myocardial infarction in 19.7 % of 70 year olds and 30 % in 75 year olds [30, 32] . That the prevalence in the PAD population was on par with a 75 year old cohort despite having a mean age of 68 is in keeping with the higher prevalence of risks factors in our population, although a recent study has called into question the link between unrecognised myocardial infarctions and traditional risk factors [33] . None of the patients with cerebrovascular disease had evidence of unrecognised myocardial infarcts. This is surprising given the results of previous studies showing unrecognised myocardial infarcts in 32 %-52 % of patients but may be due to the small numbers of this group in the current study.Recognition of unrecognised myocardial infarction is important as these have the same prognostic implications as recognised myocardial infarcts [34] . Furthermore these patients respond well to both conventional secondary prevention medication and percutaneous coronary intervention [35] [36] [37] .It could be argued that since patients with clinically apparent cardiovascular disease in one site will result in patients being treated for atherosclerotic risk factors that further information about disease elsewhere is superfluous. However this ignores several factors. Despite our study showing comparable rates of statin prescriptions between the different groups, a previous population study has shown that community prescription of risk modifying agents is markedly different between disease groups, with fewer patients with PAD being prescribed statins and antiplatelet agents compared with stroke or coronary artery disease groups [38] . This suggests poor appreciation of the extensive disease present elsewhere in the body, indeed, in our study the PAD population had the most extensive extra-primary site disease. The second is the additional prognostic information this provides. Multisite disease is associated with a significantly raised risk of future major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) compared with single site disease, and had a greater detrimental effect on future prognosis than the presence of diabetes [23, 38] . While these studies have focused on symptomatic disease, the significance of asymptomatic disease is supported by recent studies showing increased risk of MACCE in patients with higher global atherosclerotic burden on whole body MR angiography [10, 11] . Thus patients with polyvascular disease may warrant more intensive management and follow-up as well as being ideal candidates for future novel therapeutic agents [24] . For those being referred for a clinical MRA of a specific vascular territory, extension of this to a whole body cardiovascular MR would be a logical step, and indeed the added cost of extending a clinically indicated MRA to include the rest of the body is small when considered in relation to the high cost of the baseline exam, and in a peripheral arterial disease population has been shown to be cost effective due to its reductions in requirements for other imaging investigations (such as echocardiography and carotid Doppler) and alterations in patient management, although other cardiovascular disease cohorts have still to be assessed [39] .The limitations of the current study are: The study groups are unequal in size with a relatively small number of cerebrovascular patients and large number of coronary arterial disease. In addition the cerebrovascular group demonstrates a disproportionate number of females which could bias the results, however we demonstrated no significant correlation between SAS and sex, and accounting for sex using an analysis of covariance did not change the results. An intrinsic limitation of WB-MRA is its ability to only provide information on the prevalence of stenotic atherosclerosis, and will thus miss the earliest stages of the disease including vessel stiffening and remodelling. Additionally, while the prognostic effect of symptomatic multisite atherosclerosis is known, the effect of asymptomatic multisite disease still requires further work to elucidate.", "citance": "This is especially important given findings that polyvascular disease is associated with significantly higher rates for major adverse cardiovascular events than in single site vascular disease [23] .", "claims": [{"text": "Polyvascular disease is correlated with higher rates for major adverse cardiovascular events than in single site vascular disease.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Polyvascular disease is correlated with lower rates for major adverse cardiovascular events than in single site vascular disease.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}

The disease affects many organs, can be life-threatening, and currently lacks curative treatments. Inherited mutations most commonly reduce the enzyme\u2019s stability, altering its homeostasis and ultimately blunting intracellular heme production. This results in uroporphyrin by-product accumulation in the body, aggravating associated pathological symptoms such as skin photosensitivity and disfiguring phototoxic cutaneous lesions. We demonstrated that the synthetic marketed antifungal ciclopirox binds to the enzyme, stabilizing it.

This group of diseases includes congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP; ICD-10 #E80.0; MIM #263700), also known as G\u00fcnther's disease (2, 3) , which is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from a markedly deficient activity of the uroporphyrinogen III synthase (UROIIIS; EC 4.2.1.75) that leads to the specific and marked accumulation of type I porphyrins, specifically uroporphyrin I (URO I) and coproporphyrin I (COPRO I) (4) . The accumulation of these porphyrins throughout the body, especially in the skin, drives the pathogenesis of the disease and leads to hemolysis, severe anemia, splenomegaly, and disfiguring phototoxic cutaneous lesions (5) . A close relationship between the metabolic disturbance reflected by porphyrin excess and the severity of disease expression has been established (6) . For instance, the severity of the skin manifestations varies considerably among CEP patients and is dependent on porphyrin amounts in affected tissue and the degree of light exposure (7) . The prognosis for some CEP patients is severe, with death occurring in the neonatal or early life periods (8) , whereas for other patients, it is devastating and debilitating due to lifelong persistence of the symptoms.The current standard of care in most of CEP patients involves the management of disease symptoms rather than addressing the underlying pathology. Palliative care includes absolute avoidance of sun exposure, meticulous skin care, and avoiding mechanical trauma (4, 9, 10) . Attempts have been made to reduce erythropoiesis and lower concentrations of circulating porphyrin via erythrocyte transfusions, but complications associated with a chronic transfusion regimen are potentially severe and include the risk of transfusion-communicated infectious disease and iron overload (11) .Splenectomy has been performed to decrease severe hemolytic anemia and to stimulate erythropoiesis and porphyrin production, thereby increasing the lifespan of erythrocytes and resulting in the reduction of cutaneous photosensitivity. However, the results of this surgical procedure are variable, and the benefit is often short-lived (4, (10) (11) (12) . Bone marrow transplantation has also been used, and although there have been some reports of curative effects in CEP patients, this approach is mired with specific risks of complications including chemotherapy toxicity, immunosuppression leading to infections, transplant rejection, and demise (10, (13) (14) (15) . Finally, case reports describing the success of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for CEP remains limited. Moreover, it is challenging to find a human leukocyte antigen-matched donor, and patients may experience acute complications after transplantation (16) . Consequently, there are currently no approved pharmacological treatments for CEP, highlighting the need to identify novel therapeutic strategies that address the underlying pathology and affect the quality of life of these patients.Most of UROIIIS missense mutations result in proteins that are unable to fold efficiently into their native conformation in the endoplasmic reticulum (table S1) (17) . For instance, the C73R mutation in the UROS gene (present in more than one-third of reported CEP cases) produces a conformational change responsible for the decreased kinetic stability of the enzyme. Specifically, the in vitro activity of the UROIIIS-C73R mutant is about 15% of that of the wild-type (WT) enzyme and, more critically, the unfolding half-life of the mutated enzyme drops from 2.5 days (WT) to 15 min (C73R) at 37\u00b0C (18) . In agreement with this, untagged or tagged UROIIIS-C73R is expressed in cells but rapidly unfolds and is quickly targeted for proteasomal degradation, resulting in undetectable protein levels (18) (19) (20) . About 75% of reported missense mutations shares this reduced protein stability and altered homeostasis (table S1) (17) that thus constitutes the main deleterious molecular mechanism observed in CEP patients.Degradation of UROIIIS depends mostly on the activity of the proteasome instead of the lysosome pathway, providing a molecular mechanism for the failure of chloroquine treatment in CEP patients (21) . For that reason, inhibiting proteasome activity can modulate the degradation process, as shown by the effectiveness of proteasomal inhibitors in restoring mutant UROIIIS homeostasis. In particular, MG132, a well-characterized inhibitor of the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation system, was able to restore the functionality of UROIIIS in cells expressing mutant versions of the protein (19, 22) . Furthermore, in vivo treatment of CEP knock-in (Uros P248Q/P248Q ) mice with bortezomib (a proteasome inhibitor) led to a decrease in uroporphyrin accumulation in circulating red blood cells (RBCs) and urine, accompanied by the disappearance of skin photosensitivity, yet failed to improve the features of hemolytic anemia (22) . Despite these promising results, efficient, long-term proteasome inhibition is difficult to maintain in vivo and may lead to serious adverse toxic effects especially in the central nervous system (23, 24) . Thus, proteasome inhibitors are unlikely to constitute a safe therapeutic choice for CEP.One attractive alternative way to potentially regulate UROIIIS proteostasis is by means of pharmacological chaperones, which are chemical substrates or modulators that usually bind to a partially folded intermediate to stabilize the protein and allow it to complete the folding process (25) . These molecular chaperones have successfully reduced clinical symptoms of disease by slowing down or inhibiting the tendency of different proteins to aggregate, resulting in detectable amounts of enzyme in the cell (26) . Chemical chaperones have also shown promising results in restoring several destabilized mutant proteins including heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein-coupled receptors, ion channels, adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporters, and lysosomal enzymes (27) . Pharmacological chaperones usually target the binding site of the enzyme as reversible inhibitors that mimic the substrate's conformation in the transition state (28) . The use of allosteric chaperones, which stabilize the enzyme without competing with the substrate, is less explored.Here, we show that the off-patent synthetic antimicrobial ciclopirox (CPX) acts as an UROIIIS pharmacological chaperone in vitro and in vivo. We selected this compound after screening several thousand candidates for their stabilization and restoration of the homeostatic properties of UROIIIS, including a thorough biophysical, biochemical, and cellular characterization of selected hits. CPX acted as an allosteric chemical stabilizer of UROIIIS, regulated heme group metabolism in multiple eukaryotic cells, and was able to revert most of the hallmark symptomatology (abnormal URO I levels in the blood, splenomegaly, and liver porphyrins, among others) in a mouse model of the disease.", "citance": "Porphyrias, inborn errors of heme biosynthesis, are metabolic disorders, each resulting from the deficiency of a specific enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway ( fig.

{"s2orc_id": 1471797, "title": "A pseudouridine synthase module is essential for mitochondrial protein synthesis and cell viability.", "abstract": "Pseudouridylation is a common post-transcriptional modification in RNA, but its functional consequences at the cellular level remain largely unknown. Using a proximity-biotinylation assay, we identified a protein module in mitochondrial RNA granules, platforms for post-transcriptional RNA modification and ribosome assembly, containing several proteins of unknown function including three uncharacterized pseudouridine synthases, TRUB2, RPUSD3, and RPUSD4. TRUB2 and RPUSD4 were previously identified as core essential genes in CRISPR/Cas9 screens. Depletion of the individual enzymes produced specific mitochondrial protein synthesis and oxidative phosphorylation assembly defects without affecting mitochondrial mRNA levels. Investigation of the molecular targets in mitochondrial RNA by pseudouridine-Seq showed that RPUSD4 plays a role in the pseudouridylation of a single residue in the 16S rRNA, a modification that is essential for its stability and assembly into the mitochondrial ribosome, while TRUB2/RPUSD3 were similarly involved in pseudouridylating specific residues in mitochondrial mRNAs. These results establish essential roles for epitranscriptomic modification of mitochondrial RNA in mitochondrial protein synthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and cell survival.", "citation_paragraph": "Genomewide mapping studies of the epitranscriptome in human cells have revealed widespread post-transcriptional modifications in both non-coding and coding RNA [1, 2] . Pseudouridine (w), the most common RNA modification, has been suggested to play a role in RNA stability, RNA folding/secondary structure, and translation efficiency and fidelity; however, the functional consequences of this modification at the cellular level, especially in mRNA, generally remain obscure [3] . Human cells contain 13 pseudouridine synthases, but the majority remain uncharacterized, and their substrates and subcellular distribution are unknown [3] . The mitochondrial 16S rRNA contains a single known pseudouridine site [4] , and mitochondrial tRNAs are extensively pseudouridylated by PUS1, an enzyme that also modifies cytosolic tRNAs, and when mutated causes mitochondrial myopathy and sideroblastic anemia [5, 6] . Genomewide pseudouridine profiling suggested that in addition to these known pseudouridine sites in mitochondrial RNA, specific mRNAs, and the 12S rRNA might be pseudouridylated in human cells [7] , but these results have not been confirmed, nor has the enzymatic machinery been identified.Mammalian mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA) is transcribed as two polycistronic transcripts, which are further processed to produce 2 rRNAs, 11 mRNAs (including two bicistronic transcripts), and 22 tRNAs. Post-transcriptional handling of mitochondrial transcripts, as well as the assembly of the mitochondrial ribosome, occurs in nonmembrane delimited structures called mitochondrial RNA granules [8] [9] [10] [11] . These structures contain newly synthetized mtRNA and a number of RNA-binding proteins responsible for stabilization, processing, modification, folding, and degradation of mtRNA. Here we have uncovered a protein module containing three uncharacterized pseudouridine synthases that localizes to these granules. We identify the pseudouridylated sites in mitochondrial RNA that are the targets of these enzymes and investigate the functional consequences of these epitranscriptomic modifications for mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis, mitochondrial translation, and assembly of the oxidative phosphorylation complexes. one such protein, FASTKD2, cause infantile mitochondrial encephalopathy [13] . FASTKD2 binds the mitochondrial 16S rRNA [9, 14] , and it is required for the assembly of the large 39S subunit (mt-LSU) of the mitochondrial ribosome [9] , but the molecular mechanism remains unknown. To further investigate FASTKD2 function, we searched for interacting protein partners using affinity purification-mass spectrometry and BioID, a proximity-biotinylation assay that identifies interacting protein partners in vivo independent of the strength of the interaction [15] . FASTKD2 specifically interacted with known RNA granule proteins, several proteins of the mitochondrial ribosome, other mitochondrial enzymes, as well as four proteins, MTERFD1, TRUB2, WBSCR16, NGRN (Fig 1A and  Table EV1 ), whose presence in mitochondrial RNA granules has not been previously reported, and which we confirmed by immunofluorescence studies (Fig EV1) . We observed only partial overlap with GRSF1, a bone fide RNA granule protein, and it is possible that many RNA granule proteins transit into and out of the granules in response to physiological signals, a hypothesis that requires further investigation. MTERFD1 (mitochondrial transcription termination factor MTERF3) is required for the assembly of the mt-LSU [16] , whereas TRUB2 (a pseudouridine synthase), WBSCR16 (Williams-Beuren Syndrome Chromosome Region 16), and NGRN (Neugrin) are uncharacterized [17] . Using BioID, we reciprocally confirmed the specific interaction of TRUB2 with all these proteins ( Fig 1B) and identified two other pseudouridine synthases, RPUSD3 and RPUSD4, forming a plausible functional module for mitochondrial pseudouridylation. Both TRUB2 and RPUSD4 were identified as core essential genes in CRISPR/Cas9 screens of multiple human cell lines, and RPUSD3 was essential in two of the cell lines investigated [18] . NGRN, WBSCR16, TRUB2, RPUSD3, and RPUSD4 were also identified in a Crispr/Cas9 death screen for essential OXPHOS genes, and subsequent immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry studies suggested that they formed a module, independently confirming the results we obtained using the BioID assay [19] . TRUB2 also interacted with METTL15 (Fig 1B) , an orthologue of the E. coli protein RsmH, which methylates cytidine 1402 (at the N4 position) in bacterial 16S rRNA [20] , a modification conserved in the mammalian mitochondrial 12S rRNA.Depletion of the pseudouridine synthases produces specific defects in mitochondrial translation and assembly of the OXPHOS complexes Mitochondrial tRNAs and rRNAs are modified at several positions, and these modifications include methylation, thiolation, formylation, taurine addition, and pseudouridylation [6, 21] . Although some of the enzymes involved have been characterized, only one pseudouridine synthase, PUS1, which pseudouridylates both cytosolic and mitochondrial tRNAs [5] , has been investigated to date; however, it was not detected in our studies as part of the module. To investigate the role of the three mitochondrial pseudouridine synthases identified in the pseudouridylation module, we used siRNA to A B deplete each of them individually in human 143B cells, a cell line that we used to characterize the composition of mitochondrial RNA granules [8] (Figs 2A and EV2A ). The efficiency of suppression at the protein level was between 77 and 95%. No commercially available anti-RPUSD3 antibody could detect a specific band on an immunoblot, so the efficiency of the knockdown (95%) was confirmed by qRT-PCR (Table EV2) . Interestingly, depletion of MTERFD1, used as a positive control, led to a significant decrease in the levels of FASTKD2, TRUB2, RPUSD4, and NGRN (Fig EV2A) , suggesting that it plays a role as a regulator of the stability of this protein module. Depletion of TRUB2 resulted in a 50% decrease in WBSCR16 isoform 1, and a small, but significant, decrease in FASTKD2. Depletion of each of the three pseudouridine synthases led to a decrease in the levels of MRPL11, a protein of the mt-LSU, implicating the pseudouridine synthase module in mitochondrial translation and the biogenesis of the mitochondrial ribosome. Depletion of each of the pseudouridine synthases also resulted in combined oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) assembly defects ( Fig 2B and C) due to the decreased synthesis of the mtDNA-encoded polypeptides (Figs 2D and EV2B). Mitochondrial protein synthesis, as measured by a pulse-translation assay, was decreased to 76, 20, and 53% of control in cells in which TRUB2, RPUSD4, and RPUSD3 were depleted, but the nature of the defect differed in all three cases. The decrease in mitochondrial protein synthesis in TRUB2-, RPUSD3-, or RPUSD4-depleted cells was not caused by a decrease in the levels of individual mRNAs (Table EV2) ; however, the level of the 16S rRNA was decreased to 22% of control in RPUSD4-depleted cells (Table EV2) , consistent with the severe global decrease in mitochondrial protein synthesis. In 143B cells, only depletion of RPUSD4 and FASTKD2 resulted in a significant decrease in 16S rRNA (Fig EV2C) , in contrast to the results reported after Crispr/Cas9 knockdown in K562 cells [19] . It is possible that the differences between the two studies simply reflect the fact that the studies were carried out in different cell types, but this will require further investigation. Remarkably, in TRUB2 knockdown cells, the synthesis of ATP6 and ATP8 proteins (encoded on a bicistronic transcript) was severely reduced (Figs 2E and EV2B), a pattern not seen previously in cells in which any component of the mitochondrial RNA metabolism or translation machinery was depleted or mutated.Depletion of TRUB2 and RPUSD4 leads to defects in mitochondrial ribosome assemblyTo investigate the effects of depleting the individual pseudouridine synthases on the assembly of the mitochondrial ribosome, we performed a sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis in both control and depleted cells. Nearly all immunodetectable TRUB2 and RPUSD4 co-sedimented with the mt-LSU (Fig 3A) . Depletion of both TRUB2 and RPUSD4 led to a decrease in the assembly mt-LSU, as well as the 55S monosome (Figs 3B and C, and EV3), with the most severe defect appearing in cells lacking RPUSD4. The assembly of the 28S small ribosomal subunit (mt-SSU) was either not affected (siRPUSD4) or slightly increased (siTRUB2). In contrast, knockdown of RPUSD3 did not affect the assembly of the mitochondrial ribosome, suggesting that these enzymes have non-overlapping functions in mitochondrial protein synthesis.To assess whether any of the pseudouridylation module proteins formed stable high molecular weight complexes, we performed a 2D-gel analysis (Fig 3D) . TRUB2, FASTKD2, MTERFD1, and NGRN migrated largely at their predicted monomeric molecular weights, while RPUSD4 and WBSCR16 were present predominantly in higher molecular weight complexes of different sizes. Consistent with our observation that UV cross-linking was necessary to immunoprecipitate the proteins interacting with FASTKD2, these data demonstrate that the proteins in the pseudouridine synthase module do not form a stable multimeric complex, suggesting that their interactions are transient and facilitated by mitochondrial RNA.", "citance": "Post-transcriptional handling of mitochondrial transcripts, as well as the assembly of the mitochondrial ribosome, occurs in nonmembrane delimited structures called mitochondrial RNA granules [8] [9] [10] [11] .", "claims": [{"text": "Post-transcriptional handling of mitochondrial transcripts occurs in mitochondrial RNA granules.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 8908753, "title": null, "abstract": null, "citation_paragraph": "Pre-mRNAs containing multiple exons undergo sequential intron removal events during the course of splicing. Larger exons are formed as intervening introns are removed and remaining exons are ligated. Formation of increasingly larger exons could pose a problem for the spliceosome, which efficiently recognizes exons under 250 nt in length. During the process of exon ligation, new exons are continually formed that exceed this length limitation. Therefore, we anticipate that mechanisms exist to assist the spliceosome in the removal of introns flanking large ligated exons.A pair of splicing substrates was created to test intron removal efficiency (Fig. 1A) . The test substrate contains an upstream intron that is removed quickly and a downstream intron that is removed slowly. These design features promote the production of a splicing intermediate that contains a long ligated exon. The control substrate contains only the downstream intron and is identical in sequence to the test splicing intermediate. The efficiency of long intron removal can then be compared between substrates-the test having undergone an initial intron removal and the control, which has not-to evaluate the influence a neighboring splicing event has on downstream intron removal. In vitro splicing assays were performed over a 3-h time course to determine the rate of intron removal for the test and control substrates (Fig. 1B) . Although the test substrate was designed to undergo an initial short intron removal event, the intermediate for the alternative splicing pathway, initial removal of the long intron, was also observed, albeit at lower frequency. Through monitoring the levels of splicing intermediates it was possible to specifically determine the rate of long intron removal for pre-mRNAs having undergone the short intron removal event first. Analysis of the splicing reactions revealed a fivefold increase in the rate of intron removal in test substrates that underwent a previous intron removal, compared with control substrates (Fig. 1B) . Although alternative splicing pathways were observed, such as exon skipping, they were minor and did not significantly affect the calculated rate.Splicing efficiency was also analyzed in cell transfection experiments by determining the steady-state levels of spliced products. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing either the test or control substrates and RNA was isolated from cells 24 h later. Steady-state analysis of mRNA by semiquantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed that test substrates that underwent an initial intron removal were able to undergo removal of subsequent introns five times more efficiently than control substrates that never underwent a prior intron removal (Fig. 1C) , consistent with our in vitro analysis. One limitation of steady-state mRNA analyses is the fact that the levels of spliced and unspliced RNA can be influenced by differential stabilities. However, it is also appreciated that pre-mRNAs associated with spliceosomal components are more stable than unassociated splicing substrates (Hicks et al. 2005 (Hicks et al. , 2006 , arguing that the test substrate intermediate is more stable than its control counterpart. These considerations suggest that our measurement is a conservative estimate of the steady-state differences. We conclude that premRNAs that underwent a prior upstream intron removal are spliced more efficiently than substrates that did not.", "citance": "However, it is also appreciated that pre-mRNAs associated with spliceosomal components are more stable than unassociated splicing substrates (Hicks et al. 2005 (Hicks et al. , 2006 , arguing that the test substrate intermediate is more stable than its control counterpart.", "claims": [{"text": "Pre-mRNAs associated with spliceosomal components are less stable than unassociated splicing substrates.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Pre-mRNAs associated with spliceosomal components are more stable than unassociated splicing substrates.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Exercise training provides favorable anatomical and physiological changes that reduce the risk of heart disease and failure. Compared with pathological cardiac hypertrophy, exercise-induced physiological cardiac hypertrophy leads to an improvement in heart function. Exercise-induced cardiac remodeling is associated with gene regulatory mechanisms and cellular signaling pathways underlying cellular, molecular, and metabolic adaptations. Exercise training also promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative capacity leading to a decrease in cardiovascular disease. In this review, we summarized the exercise-induced adaptation in cardiac structure and function to understand cellular and molecular signaling pathways and mechanisms in preclinical and clinical trials.", "citation_paragraph": "In preclinical models, exercise training induces physiological cardiac remodeling and inhibits pathological cardiac hypertrophy, suggesting an HF improvement. Particularly, many researchers provide evidences that exercise training directly affects the mechanism of physiological cardiac hypertrophy and pathological cardiac hypertrophy through alterations of gene expression levels in genetic animal models. For example, exercise training improves cardiac function in surgical and genetic mouse models of HF and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [59, 74, 120] , but other studies reported that low-intensity exercise did not exert an effect on hypertension in rats with HF [33] . Among clinical trials, the Heart Failure: A Controlled Trial Investigating Outcomes of Exercise Training (HF-ACTION) trial is the largest study of its kind, in which the safety and effectiveness of exercise were examined in 2300 patients with HF with a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) [82] . The study investigated the combined effects of walking, treadmill, and stationary bike exercises on percent HR maximum. According to the results of the HF-ACTION trial, the prescribed exercise training did not exhibit significant decreases in cardiovascular-related mortality rates or HF-related hospitalization rates compared with that of the general treatment group [82] . However, considerable improvements were observed in the 6-min walking test and in overall fitness, which indicated improvements in QoL [40] . These findings are significant when considering the fact that the HF-ACTION trial was conducted only in patients with HFrEF.Some patients with HF are known to suffer from HF with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Although large-scale randomized studies on the effects of exercise in patients with HFpEF have not been conducted, some small-scale studies have been reported [117] . Retrospective analyses of these studies did not reveal an association between cardiopulmonary fitness and the QoL of patients with HFpEF, nor changes in their systolic and diastolic functions [88] . In these patients, exercise-induced improvements may not have exerted a substantial effect on cardiac function, suggesting possible peripheral effects on arterial stiffness, which can also affect the musculoskeletal system and endothelial function, and consequently, peripheral vascular resistance may have occurred. Given the relatively low number of patients who have registered for the HFpEF experiment to date, a randomized controlled trial with a larger study population is necessary to confirm these results. Moreover, an assessment of the type of exercise that is most useful for patients with HFpEF or HFrEF is needed.As mentioned above, all signaling pathways and factors that facilitate physiological hypertrophy exert protective effects on the heart and antagonistic actions on pathological hypertrophy in preclinical trials [11, 15, 67, 128] . According to the findings of the HF-ACTION trial, cardiac rehabilitation may be prescribed to patients with HFrEF; nevertheless, an exercise prescription presents significant challenges for these patients, as they have trouble in strictly complying with exercise prescription [82] . The subjects were generally elderly patients who had additional comorbidities that have interfered with their participation and compliance with the exercise prescription. Therefore, target therapies that facilitate exerciseinduced activation of signaling pathways in the heart may be able to supplement the prescribed exercise program. However, the identification of safe and effective targets that activate the physiological cardiac hypertrophic pathways is a difficult task. The IGF-1/PI3K pathway is a proven target in preclinical models. Likewise, hormone replacement therapy is one of the well-known strategies for increasing the circulating IGF-1 level. Preclinical trials reported the benefits of growth hormones in HF patients [53, 131] . In particular, PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b4 share many cardiac targets and induce glucose oxidation, indicating a well-balanced energy metabolism [20] . PPAR\u03b4 cooperates with AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling in the skeletal muscles to mediate their responses to exercise [80] . Therefore, a selective PPAR\u03b4 ligand appears to be an attractive target for facilitating exercise mimetics effects under HF conditions. Moreover, direct AMPK activators function as exercise mimetics, as AMPK strengthens the activities of PPAR\u03b4 in the skeletal muscles. AMPK activation retains various metabolic effects that may be beneficial in patients with HF [56] . PGC-1\u03b1, a direct target of AMPK, is directly associated with mitochondrial synthesis and energy production in the heart [54] . However, concerns regarding excess glycogen accumulation due to AMPK activation in cardiomyocytes lower than the expectations for this approach [5] . Although definitive activators of ERR have not yet been identified, it may also represent an effective target. Moreover, the mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant molecule SS-31, also known as elamipretide interacts with cardiolipin, a mitochondria-specific phospholipid [12] . Elamipretide has been shown to improve cardiac function and facilitates mitochondrial respiration in microembolization HF models [13, 99] and is currently being studied in clinical trials.", "citance": "However, considerable improvements were observed in the 6-min walking test and in overall fitness, which indicated improvements in QoL [40] .", "claims": [{"text": "Prescribed exercise training has no effect on overall fitness.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Prescribed exercise training improves overall fitness.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Prescribed exercise training improves quality of life.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Prescribed exercise training improves results in a 6-minute walking test.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Prescribed exercise training worsens quality of life.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Prescribed exercise training worsens results in a 6-minute walking test.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}

We studied the impact of HIV and HAART on ARR among patients taking thrice-weekly antituberculosis therapy.   METHODS This cross-protocol analysis included patients with newly diagnosed, rifampicin-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis, with and without HIV, enrolled in clinical trials (who took >80% of medication) at the National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis between 1999 and 2013. All patients received rifampicin and isoniazid for 6 months reinforced with pyrazinamide and ethambutol in the first 2 months, given thrice-weekly throughout the study along with HAART in one of the groups. Outcomes were categorized and multivariate logistic regression analysis performed to identify risk factors for ARR.   RESULTS The per-protocol results included patients with tuberculosis: 246 HIV-uninfected patients (HIV(-)TB(+)), 212 HIV patients not on HAART (non-HAART), and 116 HIV-infected patients on HAART. Median CD4 counts of the latter 2 groups were 150 and 93 cells/\u00b5L, respectively, and the median viral loads were 147 000 and 266 000 copies/mL, respectively. Compared with HIV(-)TB(+), the relative risks (RRs) for an unfavorable response in the coinfected, non-HAART and HAART groups were 2.1 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7-14.8; P<.0001) and 2.1 (95% CI, .9-5.2; P=.3), whereas for ARR, the RRs were 21.1 (95% CI, 2.6-184; P<.001) and 8.2 (95% CI, .6-104; P=.07), respectively.   CONCLUSIONS HIV-infected patients with tuberculosis treated with a thrice-weekly antituberculosis regimen are at a higher risk of ARR, compared with HIV-uninfected patients, in the presence of baseline isoniazid resistance. HAART reduces but does not eliminate the risk of ARR.", "citation_paragraph": "This unique comparison of tuberculosis treatment outcomes from 3 different groups of patients, treated with an identical thrice-weekly ATT in the same setting, enabled us to evaluate the impact of HIV and HAART on ARR. Failures during treatment truly reflected the strength of the regimen rather than recurrences, which could be influenced by tuberculosis endemicity in that region and the level of immunodeficiency in the patient [19, 20] . We found that failing tuberculosis Abbreviations: ARR, acquired rifampicin resistance; E, ethambutol; H, isoniazid; HAART, highly active antiretroviral therapy; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; R, rifampicin; S, streptomycin; TB, tuberculosis. Pretreatment INH resistance is a known risk factor for amplification of drug resistance among tuberculosis patients on ATT [21] . In fact, the incidence of ARR, even among HIV-uninfected patients with tuberculosis, was 5 times higher in the presence of initial INH resistance compared with patients harboring fully drug-susceptible organisms [7] .Varying plasma levels of INH and rifampicin, due to differential half-lives, cause functional monotherapy. Malabsorption of ATT drugs in HIV may further potentiate occurrence of ARR [22] [23] [24] . Our study similarly revealed that pretreatment INH resistance was a significant risk factor for development of ARR among tuberculosis patients, irrespective of HIV status. Among HIV-infected patients with tuberculosis, a low CD4 count and a higher mycobacterial burden at baseline were additional risk factors. It would be interesting to study the occurrence of ARR among HIV patients on HAART, with a relatively higher CD4 count at the time of tuberculosis diagnosis, as well as among those receiving daily ATT.Incidence of ARR was observed to be high among failures and relapses when intermittent tuberculosis therapy was used in the presence of HIV infection. In our previous study, all patients who failed therapy had ARR [6] . Further, subgroup analysis revealed that patients who developed ARR had a significantly lower CD4 cell count, lymphocyte percentage, and higher sputum culture grade at baseline, compared with those who did not [6, 25] . In the study by Vernon et al, 4 of 5 patients who relapsed in the once-weekly rifapentine arm compared with none in the twice-weekly rifampicin arm (given in the continuation phase along with INH), developed ARR [4] . Risk factors identified included younger age, lower CD4 count, extrapulmonary tuberculosis, and concomitant antifungal treatment. Of note, none of the HIV-uninfected patients enrolled in that trial developed ARR [4] .Additionally, in a study of 169 patients with advanced HIV, Burman et al [24] found that 8 of 9 patients (with CD4 count <100 cells/\u00b5L) with failure or relapse had ARR. A recent retrospective survey from a California tuberculosis registry reported a 5 times higher risk of ARR in dual infection. Cavitation at baseline and absence of directly observed therapy were other risk factors in that study [26] .Nosocomial transmission facilitated by prolonged or frequent hospitalization, which is inevitable without HAART, could partly explain the higher rates of ARR in our HIV + TB + , non-HAART group [6, 20, 24, 27] . Li et al [28] found that patients relapsed with ARR when intermittent dosing of tuberculosis drugs was used throughout the treatment period. However, ARR was infrequent when a daily intensive phase was followed by an intermittent continuation phase. In a meta-analysis of published studies, Lew et al [29] identified initial drug resistance as the main predisposing factor for ARR. The incidence of ARR was 0.8%, 6%, and 14% when patients harbored pan-susceptible, single-drug resistant, and polydrug-resistant organisms, respectively [29] .Another meta-analysis among dually infected patients by Khan et al [30] concluded that thrice-weekly antituberculosis regimens were associated with more failures, relapses, and acquisition of drug resistance (to tuberculosis). This trend was reduced considerably with HAART administration. They also found that a daily administration of ATT during the intensive phase, with rifampicin given throughout for at least 6 months, improved tuberculosis treatment outcomes in HIV-infected patients [30] .Preliminary results from an ongoing RCT comparing daily with intermittent antituberculosis regimens in patients with culture-positive pulmonary tuberculosis (NCT0933790) revealed a significantly higher rate of culture conversion at 2 months, as well as a trend toward lower incidence of ARR in the daily arm [14, 31] .The strengths of our study were that all patients had identical tuberculosis regimens. Quality-assured drugs were used and patients were treated under similar trial conditions. High compliance rate and intense clinical monitoring was ensured. Mycobacterial culture and drug susceptibility testing were performed every month at a supranational reference laboratory.The limitations were that these were not head-to-head comparisons, but rather nonconcurrent trials. The numbers eligible for this analysis from the HIV + TB + HAART group were relatively small. Other limitations were the differences in drug supervision patterns and the varying time of ART initiation within the HIV cohorts.In conclusion, HIV-infected patients with tuberculosis are at a higher risk of ARR than are HIV-uninfected patients, when treated with a thrice-weekly antituberculosis regimen, especially in the presence of baseline INH resistance. HAART reduces but does not eliminate the risk of ARR completely. Daily tuberculosis treatment, prompt diagnosis of HIV, and earlier HAART initiation preserving immune function in HIV-infected tuberculosis patients could potentially prevent amplification of drug resistance.

{"s2orc_id": 17231197, "title": "Molecular Mechanisms of DNA Replication Checkpoint Activation", "abstract": "The major challenge of the cell cycle is to deliver an intact, and fully duplicated, genetic material to the daughter cells. To this end, progression of DNA synthesis is monitored by a feedback mechanism known as replication checkpoint that is untimely linked to DNA replication. This signaling pathway ensures coordination of DNA synthesis with cell cycle progression. Failure to activate this checkpoint in response to perturbation of DNA synthesis (replication stress) results in forced cell division leading to chromosome fragmentation, aneuploidy, and genomic instability. In this review, we will describe current knowledge of the molecular determinants of the DNA replication checkpoint in eukaryotic cells and discuss a model of activation of this signaling pathway crucial for maintenance of genomic stability.", "citation_paragraph": "The current model for ATR activation assumes that ATR is recruited onto ssDNA via an interaction with its cofactor ATRIP (ATR-Interacting Protein) and RPA [96, 97] . ATR associates with ATRIP in a stable stoichiometric complex independently of DNA damage. ATRIP binds directly to RPA-coated ssDNA, and is thought to target ATR at sites of replicative stress or DNA damage [98, 99] . After induction of damage, ATR and ATRIP are located in DNA damage nuclear foci [99] and, in human cells, formation of these foci is inhibited when the expression of RPA is downregulated by RNA interference [97, 100] . In addition, down regulation of RPA also result in inhibition of checkpoint activation. These findings have led to the proposal that nucleation of RPA onto ssDNA generated at stalled forks is a key determinant of checkpoint activation. However, more recent data in Xenopus egg extracts show that recruitment of excess RPA at stalled forks is dispensable for S-phase checkpoint activation, while generation of ssDNA is absolutely required [101] . These results are consistent with previous observations in mammalian cells showing that RPA is not quantitatively required for checkpoint activation [102] and that, in yeast, an RPA mutant that cannot interact with the checkpoint clamp 9-1-1 complex (see below) is still checkpoint proficient [103] . Finally, an ATRIP mutant that cannot interact with RPA was also shown to normally activate the checkpoint in mammalian cells [98] . In addition to its participation in checkpoint activation, RPA is primarily required for the establishment of replication forks (see Section 2.3). Thus, without RPA, replication forks cannot be made and therefore ssDNA is not stabilized. Hence, it is very likely that removal of RPA from the cell mainly inhibits checkpoint activation indirectly-by inhibiting DNA synthesis (see below)-an issue that was not previously fully taken into account [104] . Interestingly, some of us have shown that reduced levels of RPA induce formation of excess ssDNA and ATR activation, and that in S-phase, ssDNA is not processed by exonucleolytic activities [101] . This is not surprising knowing that many other ssDNA binding proteins exist in the cell that may protect ssDNA from cleavage [105] . It is thus unlikely that in the presence of low levels of RPA, ssDNA is present under naked, unprotected form in the cell. However, this substrate may be unstable in mitosis, when cells attempt to segregate chromosomes with underreplicated DNA, since it can fuel recombination-based mechanisms, as previously proposed [106] . Based on these observations, some of us predicted that hypomorphic mutations in RPA or other replication proteins might be a source of replication stress that can trigger genomic instability. In line with this possibility, a hypomorphic mutation in RPA was previously shown to induce genetic instability and fuel lymphoma in mice [106] , and recently, genomic instability has been observed also in human cells in which RPA is limiting [107] . In this report, ATR is also suggested to be important to limit formation of ssDNA upon replication stress, by inhibiting firing of dormant origins (see Section 5.6).Activation of ATR kinase activity requires recruitment of important ATR activators, the checkpoint clamp Rad9-Hus1-Rad1 (9-1-1 complex) and TopBP1 [108] . The heterotrimeric 9-1-1 complex is loaded at stalled replication forks in a similar manner to PCNA, which is loaded by RF-C, except that loading of this checkpoint clamp complex involves an RF-C-like complex in which the largest subunit of RF-C (RFC1) is replaced by Rad17 (RFC Rad17 ) [109, 110] . It has been demonstrated that binding of the 9-1-1 complex requires the presence of a 5'-end at the junction between double and ssDNA [111, 112] . Interestingly, although the recruitment of the 9-1-1 complex and ATR onto chromatin are independent and both necessary for full ATR activation [111] , an in vitro study in S. cerevisiae suggests a direct interaction between the C-terminal part of Ddc1 with Mec1 (respectively RAD9 and ATR homologues in S. cerevisiae, see Table 1 ) [113] . TopBP1 is a large, multi-functional protein, playing an essential role in both DNA synthesis and checkpoint activation [114, 115] . These functions of TopBP1 come under separable domains: the N-terminal domain is necessary for activation of DNA synthesis, while the C-terminal domain is required for checkpoint activation [116, 117] . Although TopBP1 function appears not to be essential during ongoing DNA synthesis, this protein is found associated with unperturbed replication forks [29, 118] and may stimulate ATR activity by local specific protein-protein interactions during replication fork progression to coordinate the temporal order of origins firing. Several additional interactions have been described for TopBP1 in replication checkpoint. Interaction between the phosphorylated tail of Rad9 (on serine 387) with BRCT repeats I and II of TopBP1 [119] [120] [121] and another interaction between TopBP1 with ATR-ATRIP through a specific domain known as ATR-Activation Domain or AAD [122, 123] localize TopoBP1 for ATR activation. Recruitment of high levels of 9-1-1 on chromatin require TopBP1 [124] and stabilization of TopBP1 at stalled forks has been shown to be also dependent upon the DNA helicase FANCJ/BACH1 [125] . Finally, interaction between TopBP1 and the MDC1 (Mediator of the checkpoint 1) protein has been shown to be important for Chk1 phosphorylation after replication stress [126] . Recently, the MRN complex has also been implicated in ATR activation through stabilization of TopBP1 [127] and this function appears to depend upon its catalytic activity [128] . Altogether, these findings highlight a complex structural network of interactions mediated by TopBP1 whose function in the context of the stalled replication forks will be very interesting to elucidate in the future.Previous observations have proposed a role for DNA synthesis in ATR activation [129, 130] . DNA primase/polymerase activities were shown to be required for ATR activation at stalled replication forks. Since this enzyme is absolutely required to initiate DNA synthesis, these data can be interpreted as an indirect role for DNA polymerase \u03b1 in stimulating replication forks formation. This is well illustrated by the observation that the checkpoint is inactive when initiation of DNA synthesis is inhibited by Geminin [101, 129] . However, a recent study has addressed the requirement of DNA synthesis in DNA replication checkpoint [131] and convincingly showed that continued synthesis and elongation of new DNA primers on ssDNA templates occurs at replication forks stalled with aphidicolin. Since synthesis of these replication intermediates is essential for binding of the 9-1-1 complex, these findings highlight an additional key step in ATR signaling. Formation of ssDNA at arrested forks may be then important to generate replication intermediates that stimulate recruitment of the 9-1-1 complex catalyzed by the RFC Rad17 complex. Once loaded, the 9-1-1 checkpoint clamp is tethered to the ATR-ATRIP complex via the TopBP1 C-terminus, thus leading to ATR activation ( Figure 4) . Nonetheless, it remains unclear what the precise molecular substrates are that allow ATR activation. Recent data suggest that autophosphorylation of ATR is important for its kinase activity. Autophosphorylation appears to be dependent on RPA, 9-1-1, and not TopBP1 [132] . A similar model based on autophosphorylation was previously proposed for ATM activation [133] , suggesting a conserved mechanism of activation within the PI3K family. ATM activation has also been shown to require generation of small DNA fragments [134] . Short replication intermediates synthesized onto ssDNA generated at stalled forks would be the equivalent substrate that stimulates ATR activation (see below). Interestingly, ATR can also be activated following processing of a DSB by end-resection (see Section 5.2), but the role of small DNA fragments generated in this process remains to be determined. Alternatively, ATR may be activated in a different manner in specific situations. Figure 3 ) that is coated by RPA. On the lagging strand DNA polymerase, \u03b1 and \u03b4 replicative polymerases catalyze synthesis of short replication intermediates (priming reaction). It is not yet clear whether these intermediates are also generated on the leading strand, and if this is the case, which is the DNA polymerase implicated (question mark). A strong candidate is the recently identified Primpol enzyme [135] [136] [137] [138] [139] . TLS DNA Pol \u03ba may be implicated in recruitment of the 9-1-1 complex by stabilization and/or synthesis of short replication intermediates in proximity of the ATR-ATRIP complex thus facilitating interaction via TopBP1. The MRN complex may facilitate the interaction between TopBP1 and ATR by an as yet unknown mechanism. Once activated, ATR may autophosphorylates and phosphorylate chromatin-bound as well as soluble substrate (-P). CHK1 is phosphorylated by ATR (A), and phosphorylation is potentiated via interaction with Mrc1/Claspin within the FPC (B), although this can also occur in the soluble fraction of the nucleus.

{"s2orc_id": 26560039, "title": "Palliative care in urgent need of recognition and development in general practice: the example of Germany", "abstract": "BACKGROUND Specialist palliative care is being increasingly recognised and developed to improve end-of-life care in many developed countries. However, only a small proportion of the total number of patients with incurable, progressive diseases actually has direct contact with specialist palliative care practitioners. Using the German situation as an example, the main purpose of this paper is to argue that the emphasis on specialist palliative care services without a similar encouragement of primary palliative care will deliver a constrained service.   DISCUSSION For the vast majority of people with incurable, progressive diseases, good palliative care delivered by General Practitioners and community nurses, with access to specialist support when needed, is the optimal response. In Germany, specialist palliative care in the community was established in the 2007 health care reforms. However actual and potential delivery of palliative care by general practitioners and community based nurses has been sorely neglected. The time-consuming care of palliative patients and their families is currently far from accurately reflected in German, indeed most European primary care payment systems. However, it is not just a question of adequate financial compensation but also of the recognition of the fundamental value of this intense form of holistic family medicine.   SUMMARY It is imperative palliative care carried out by community nurses and general practitioners is better recognised by health professionals, health insurers, government and the scientific community as a central part of the delivery of health care for people in the last phase of life. Health systems should be arranged so that this critical role of general practice and primary care is intentionally fostered. Palliative care carried out by generalists needs an identity at an academic and practical level, developing in concert with specialist palliative care.", "citation_paragraph": "In order to meet these challenges, the development of existing specialist palliative care is an important step. The debate will however fall short of the issue if, as is frequently the case, it focuses almost exclusively on specialist care. For the vast majority of people in the final phase of life with incurable, progressive diseases, good primary care delivered by GPs and community nurses, i.e. primary palliative care, is the optimal response [7] . In politics, public and professional circles, however, this aspect has been sorely neglected.Beneficial as the introduction of specialist palliative care in the community (SAPV) in Germany was, the failure to encourage primary palliative care at the same time remains baffling. The time-consuming care of palliative patients and their families is currently far from accurately reflected in the primary care compensation Figure 1 Seamless transition between specialist and generalist palliative care services according to intensity of need.[23] Figure 2 Organisation of health system to facilitate needs-based palliative care. [23] system. The same holds for the numerous home visits that are often required, or for the willingness of many primary care doctors to be, for the sake of their patients, available outside of, and in addition to, their official practice times and emergency duties. This is not just a question of adequate financial compensation, but also of the recognition of requirements in health care delivery, and patients' needs, and of the fundamental value of this intense form of holistic family medicine.Transition between primary and specialist palliative careAn ideal health system for managing palliative care would see a seamless transition between primary and specialist palliative care, and provision of support in the form of access to evidence based guidelines, supported by specialist involvement ranging from one-off consultations to full referral. In effect, the care of the patient is shared between the two, with the primary care team usually determining when and how much support is required.In Australia, for example, much work has been done to facilitate needs-based palliative care delivery to ensure that patients receive the right level of care at the right time [21, 22] . A schematic representation of this model developed by Australian policy makers is shown in Figures 1  and 2 [23] .In Britain, which has long-established and well developed specialist palliative care services, a general practice-based system of routinely identifying patients who could die, and developing care plans for these people on an individual basis is encouraged by formal financial support by the National Health Service [24, 25] .In Germany, specialist palliative care in the community (SAPV) as established with the 2007 health care reforms provides the appropriate legal and system requirements for smooth transition between primary and specialist palliative care [10] . It is much to be hoped that further refinement of the implementation into practice will facilitate and support appropriate primary palliative care.", "citance": "For the vast majority of people in the final phase of life with incurable, progressive diseases, good primary care delivered by GPs and community nurses, i.e. primary palliative care, is the optimal response [7] .", "claims": [{"text": "Primary palliative care is the optimal response for most people in the final phase of life with an incurable progressive disease.

However, the results have been inconsistent. We aimed to systematically review the published studies and quantitatively evaluate the effects of these variants on the risk of sepsis.   METHODS We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, Medline, Web of Knowledge, and HuGE databases to identify studies that investigated the associations between genetic variants and sepsis risk. Then, we conducted meta-analyses of the associations for genetic variants with at least three study populations and applied the Venice criteria to assess the association result credibility.   RESULTS A literature search identified 349 eligible articles that investigated 405 variants of 172 distinct genes. We performed 204 primary and 185 subgroup meta-analyses for 76 variants of 44 genes. The results showed that 29 variants of 23 genes were significantly associated with the risk of sepsis, including 8 variants of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), 14 variants of cytokines, one variant of an immune-related gene and 6 variants of other genes. Furthermore, the cumulative epidemiological evidence of a significant association between each variant and the risk of sepsis was classified as strong or moderate for 18 variants. For the 329 variants with fewer than three study populations, 63 variants of 48 genes have been reported to be significantly associated with the risk of sepsis in a systematic review.   CONCLUSION We identified several genetic variants that could influence the susceptibility to sepsis by systematic review and meta-analysis. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the genetic architecture of variants involved in sepsis susceptibility and novel insight that may affect personalized targeted treatment in the future clinical management of sepsis.", "citation_paragraph": "Cytokines released from immune cells are major players in the inflammatory response to infection. Primary pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-1 (IL-1), induce secondary pro-and anti-inflammatory mediators such as IL-6 and IL-10 [24] . Genetic variants of these cytokines have been shown to play key roles in determining susceptibility to sepsis [6] .Forty-one studies investigated the association between TNFA rs1800629-308G/A and the risk of sepsis (5540 cases and 9709 controls). In the primary meta-analysis, significant associations between the -308G/A polymorphism and the risk of sepsis were found under all three genetic models. Furthermore, through stratified analysis according to ethnicity and age, the associations were more significant in the adult and Asian populations than in the overall populations, suggesting that this SNP might be specifically linked to the adult and Asian populations. In our study, data on the second TNFA variant (rs1799724-857C/T) from three studies (502 cases and 1373 controls) were meta-analyzed. The overall results showed that there was a significant association between this variant and the risk of sepsis under the dominant model (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.01-1.64, P = 0.04) with a low level of evidence. Associations between a third TNFA variant (rs361525-238G/A) and the risk of sepsis were investigated in nine studies. The primary meta-analysis indicated a highly significant association between the TNFA rs361525-238G/A variant and the risk of sepsis under the recessive model (OR = 4.88, 95% CI = 2.19-10.87, P < 0.0001). Furthermore, in the analysis stratified by ethnicity, only Asian individuals with this variant had a higher risk of sepsis than individuals with the wild-type allele under the dominant and allelic genetic models. The LTA rs909253+252 T/C variant was analyzed in 32 studies with 4762 cases and 7588 controls and was significantly associated with the risk of sepsis under the dominant and allelic models; however, there was a low level of evidence due to between-study heterogeneity. The associations were also significant in the analyses stratified by ethnicity and age.Seven studies investigated the IL1B rs143634+3594C/ T variant. The result of the overall comparison suggested that the association of this variant with sepsis susceptibility was significant under the recessive genetic model (OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.34-0.82, P = 0.034). Meanwhile, the stratified analysis showed that there was a significant association between this variant and the risk of sepsis in the white population (OR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.32-0.80, P = 0.003 for the recessive model) and the adult population (OR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.33-0.90, P = 0.02 for the recessive model). With regard to rs1800796-572G/C, which is located in the IL-6 promoter region, there was no significant association with the risk of sepsis in the primary meta-analysis. However, three studies in Asian populations indicated a significant association between -572G/C and the risk of sepsis (OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.29-0.96, P = 0.04 for the recessive model). In the adult population, the association between this variant and the risk of sepsis was also confirmed under the dominant model. A significantly increased risk of sepsis was found to be associated with another variant, rs1800795-174G/C, in the allelic model (OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.01-1.35, P = 0.03) through the primary meta-analysis of 17 studies and the subgroup analysis of adults (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.19-1.73, P < 0.0001 for the recessive model and OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.06-1.46, P = 0.008 for the allelic model). For IL-8rs4073-251 T/A, the association between the variant and the risk of sepsis were confirmed under all genetic models in the primary analysis and the subgroup analysis according to ethnicity. For the IL10 rs1800871-819C/T variant, a significant association with the susceptibility to sepsis was only confirmed in the Asian population (OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.03-1.76, P = 0.03 for the recessive model).Five studies of the IFNG rs2430561-874A/T variant were included in the meta-analysis. The results of the overall comparison suggested that the association of this variant with the risk of sepsis was significant under the dominant genetic model (OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.07-1.68, P = 0.01). The rs1429638A/C variant of the CXCL1 gene and the rs2297630A/G and rs266087A/G polymorphisms of the CXCL12 gene were found to be associated with altered susceptibility to traumatic sepsis in Wang's study (accepted by Journal of Trauma Acute Care Surg). Four studies of MIF-173G/C were included in the metaanalysis.

{"s2orc_id": 14719497, "title": "Isolation of Small SSEA-4-Positive Putative Stem Cells from the Ovarian Surface Epithelium of Adult Human Ovaries by Two Different Methods", "abstract": "The adult ovarian surface epithelium has already been proposed as a source of stem cells and germinal cells in the literature, therefore it has been termed the \"germinal epithelium\". At present more studies have confirmed the presence of stem cells expressing markers of pluripotency in adult mammalian ovaries, including humans. The aim of this study was to isolate a population of stem cells, based on the expression of pluripotency-related stage-specific embryonic antigen-4 (SSEA-4) from adult human ovarian surface epithelium by two different methods: magnetic-activated cell sorting and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Both methods made it possible to isolate a similar, relatively homogenous population of small, SSEA-4-positive cells with diameters of up to 4  \u03bcm from the suspension of cells retrieved by brushing of the ovarian cortex biopsies in reproductive-age and postmenopausal women and in women with premature ovarian failure. The immunocytochemistry and genetic analyses revealed that these small cells--putative stem cells--expressed some primordial germ cell and pluripotency-related markers and might be related to the in vitro development of oocyte-like cells expressing some oocyte-specific transcription factors in the presence of donated follicular fluid with substances important for oocyte growth and development. The stemness of these cells needs to be further researched.", "citation_paragraph": "Microarray analysis showed that the primordial germ cell-(PGC-) related gene PRDM1 (BLIMP1) was strongly expressed in small putative ovarian stem cells. In both hESCs ( = 8.29 \u2212 03) and human adult fibroblasts ( = 2.71 \u2212 04) PRDM1 was significantly downregulated at the log ratio < \u22124 in comparison with ovarian stem cells, as revealed by DGAs. In addition putative ovarian stem cells expressed PRDM14, but the expression of this gene was upregulated in hESCs ( = 6.41 \u2212 03) and down-regulated in fibroblasts ( = 6.94 \u2212 03). The PRDM1 gene is the key determinant of PGCs and plays a combinatorial role with PRDM14 during PGC specification from postimplantation epiblast cells [25] . Moreover, PRDM1 is a critical determinant of the germ cell lineage in mice. The genetic lineage-tracing experiments indicated that the PRDM1-positive cells originated from the proximal posterior epiblast cells and were indeed the lineage-restricted PGC precursors [26] . Therefore, the relation of small putative stem cells from the adult ovarian surface epithelium to PGCs is not excluded.Small putative ovarian stem cells weakly expressed the core genes related to pluripotency, ESCs, or germ cells, such as DPPA3 (STELLA), OCT4A (POU5F1), SOX2, and NANOG, which were significantly up-regulated in hESCs ( = 2.79 \u2212 07, = 9.90 \u2212 03, = 1.09 \u2212 03, 1.24 \u2212 02), yet the expression of genes TERT and DAZL was not detected in putative ovarian stem cells at all. The gene TERT may not be expressed in quiescent PGCs, and it has already been confirmed that it does not affect the proliferation and development of PGCs by itself [27] . Some recent studies also showed that the expression of the gene DAZL is not a prerequisite for PGC proliferation [28] . The expression of gene DPPA3 may confirm the potential relation of small putative ovarian stem cells to PGC lineage [29] .Two of the samples of ovarian stem cells expressed the genes related to pluripotency more than the third one, as revealed by microarrays. When these two samples were compared to somatic fibroblasts, some of pluripotency-related genes were found to be significantly down-regulated in the somatic fibroblasts, such as SALL4 ( = 2.23 \u2212 03), CDH1 (3.21 \u221202), and LEFTY1 (1.42 \u221203); values were adjusted to the effect of multiple testing according to BenjaminiHochberg (limma, Bioconductor, programme R 2.14.1).

Several attempts are done to obtain the best and closest prognostic predictive biomarkers for breast cancer. The present study aimed to evaluate the impact of novel ratios calculated between the blood indices with CA15.3, alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase as prognostic biomarkers in breast cancer. This study was conducted on two groups (Breast cancer Patients group in comparison to a control group who has no tumor family history). All the volunteers are subjected to the routine analysis included liver and kidney function tests, complete blood count with blood indices, tumor markers (CA15.3) assessment, alkaline phosphatase, and lactate dehydrogenase analysis. Thirty different ratios were calculated in the present research between blood indices and three inexpensive serum biomarkers; CA15.3, alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase. Fifteen ratios of them were significant in breast cancer group than the control group. Three ratios (PDW/lymphocytes, MPV/lymphocytes, and ALP/RDW) of them gave a sensitivity of 100% with high specificity as indicators for breast cancer incidence. The correlation between significant ratios was very interesting. The more interesting was in the results of subgroup analysis which showed that the ALP/RDW ratio is more specific for pre-menopause while PDW/lymphocytes ratio is more specific for post-menopause. The ratios PDW/lymphocytes, MPV/lymphocytes, and ALP/RDW can be used as prognostic biomarkers in breast cancer patients.

Fifteen ratios of them were higher in patients significantly. Seven ratios of them were chosen to be analyzed with ROC Curve to emphasize their impact in prognosis and following up of disease. Our findings may provide important supporting information to treatment decisions and predict treatment outcomes. The serum levels of ALP and LDH are routine diagnostic tests in clinical laboratories. The present research showed a high significant level in patients in both of them (p < 0.001). Several studies reported the activity of ALP Table 5 Correlation between the seven chosen ratios in the research in the breast cancer patients PDW platelets distribution width, MPV mean platelets volume, RDW red cell distribution width, Hb hemoglobin, ALP alkaline phosphatase, LDH lactate dehydrogenase *P < 0.05 is significant, **P < 0.01 is very high significant, and ***P < 0.001 is very high significant in cancerous cells [75, 76] . The absolute level of ALP in breast cancer patients is still under debate especially by comparing its level in metastatic and non-metastatic [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] . Similarly, LDH level was found to be higher in cancerous cells than normal cells which affect the tumor metabolism and promote tumor progression [85, 86] . Thus, the potential role of LDH as a prognostic biomarker in oncology has long been recognized associated with poor survival in terminal cancer patients [87] [88] [89] [90] [91] .To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first study to assess the prognostic value of ratios calculated between both ALP and LDH with each other and with four parameters of hematological parameters (RBCs, RDW, platelets, PDW). The results were very effective in ALP/ RDW, ALP/RBCs, LDH/RDW, LDH/RBCs.The important role of platelet activation in tumor development was shown by several studies. More ever, thrombocytosis was proved to be cancer-associated paraneoplastic phenomena. Platelets indices; MPV and PDW are Table 6 Cut off value, sensitivity, and specificity for the seven chosen ratios Sn sensitivity, Sp specificity, J Youden's index, PPV positive predictive value, NPV negative predictive value, AUC area under curve, SE standard error *P < 0.05 is significant, **P < 0.01 is very high significant, and ***P < 0.001 is very high significant [18] [19] [20] [21] . Elevated values of PDW point to the presence of mature and immature cells at the same time in circulation. This suggests that an elevation in PDW may be associated with irregular thrombosis [93] . Thus, the original mechanism for platelets and their indices elevation might be straightforward. Various pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 are upregulated in parallel with tumor development [94, 95] . These cytokines stimulate synthesis and secretion of undeveloped platelets with different characteristics and sizes into the blood to meet the increased needs [96] . A second explanation for increasing platelets count and its associated indices in cancer is based on the several platelet-derived growth factors which are often produced in large quantities by cancer cells [8, 9, 97] . Actually, many studies reported the role of PDGF in cancer progression and aggressiveness with unfavorable clinical pathological and reduced survival [10] [11] [12] [13] . To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first study that compared between the impact of different ratios calculated from platelets and their indices with (lymphocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes, CA15.3, ALP, and LDH) in the prognosis of breast cancer. The results were significant in 5 of 17 ratios. The results were interesting in ratios calculated from platelets or PDW or MPV to lymphocytes. In addition, the ratios calculated with MPV and platelets to neutrophils were significant too.Red cell distribution with (RDW) is a usually used laboratory parameter for the measurement of the degree of erythrocyte size variation (anisocytosis), which reveals the variability of the size of the circulating RBCs [98] .

Several recent studies reported the change in RDW in cases of inflammation and cancer [29, [103] [104] [105] [106] [107] . Truly, high RDW could be used in the differentiation between benign and malignant breast cancer. However, it is understandable that RDW cannot be used alone as a specific indicator of being malignant because of its relationship with other common pathological conditions. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first study that compared between the impact of different ratios calculated from RBCs and RDW with three types of (PDW, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes, Hb, CA15.3, ALP, and LDH) in the prognosis of breast cancer. The results were significant in 8 of 12 ratios. The results were interesting in ratios calculated from either RBCs or RDW with both ALP and LDH. In addition, the ratios calculated with only RDW with either Hb or lymphocytes or neutrophils were significant too.The most novel and interesting results in the present study is the ROC analysis and correlation analysis made to the most interesting ratios in the research. The Roc analysis provided three ratios (PDW/lymphocytes, MPV/lymphocytes, and ALP/RDW) with sensitivity 100% and with high specificity (85%, 77%, and 83% respectively). In addition, the area under the curve for (PDW/lymphocytes and ALP/RDW) was relatively high (0.861, 0.803 respectively).The second interesting result in the present research is the RDW/lymphocytes ratio which gives high AUC of 0.814 and with significant correlation with four ratios (PDW/lymphocytes, MPV/lymphocytes, and platelets/lymphocytes, and CA15.3/PDW) (p = 0.012, < 0.001, 0.026, < 0.01 respectively).In fact, we have to keep in mind those parameters such as RDW, PDW, ALP, and LDH are always made in routine blood analysis and does not raise the charge of diagnostic strategy; this particular point stands for a major advantage regarding its easy and cost-effective application.However, Combining between the results of significant ratios with other predictive indicators might be more significant in patients with breast cancer [108] . This is the direct goal of the present study with such analysis.The role of such significant ratios could represent a new accurate and reproducible laboratory index to identify patients with worse prognosis in women with breast cancer. However, further prospective studies are needed to evaluate the potential role of these significant ratios in guiding treatment decisions.The limitations of this study include the relatively small sample size, the fewer control number than patients, and single-center design. The retrospective nature of our study may also have caused bias regarding data selection and analysis. Also, there may have been a lack of uniformity because enrolled patients have not received a unified treatment which may influence patients' survival. Despite these limitations, our study is the first to reveal the complete correlation network between ALP and LDH with blood indices which can be indicative of unfavorable prognosis in patients with localized breast cancer. Further prospective studies can confirm these preliminary results with investigating to correlations between blood parameters with more inexpensive serum biomarkers other than ALP and LDH.In conclusion, the present study demonstrated the relation between different routine laboratory markers might be used as novel indicators of breast cancer. Although our preliminary findings need to be evaluated by larger studies, the close interplay between inflammation and cancer provides a solid theoretical base to support the evidence provided by this study.", "citance": "Various pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 are upregulated in parallel with tumor development [94, 95] .", "claims": [{"text": "Pro-inflammatory cytokines are up regulated during tumor development.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Pro-inflammatory cytokines are up repressed during tumor development.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Tumor development occurs in conjunction with suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Tumor development occurs in conjunction with upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 3158068, "title": "Systematic Analysis of Gene Expression Differences between Left and Right Atria in Different Mouse Strains and in Human Atrial Tissue", "abstract": "BACKGROUND Normal development of the atria requires left-right differentiation during embryonic development. Reduced expression of Pitx2c (paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 2, isoform c), a key regulator of left-right asymmetry, has recently been linked to atrial fibrillation. We therefore systematically studied the molecular composition of left and right atrial tissue in adult murine and human atria.   METHODS We compared left and right atrial gene expression in healthy, adult mice of different strains and ages by employing whole genome array analyses on freshly frozen atrial tissue. Selected genes with enriched expression in either atrium were validated by RT-qPCR and Western blot in further animals and in shock-frozen left and right atrial appendages of patients undergoing open heart surgery.   RESULTS We identified 77 genes with preferential expression in one atrium that were common in all strains and age groups analysed. Independent of strain and age, Pitx2c was the gene with the highest enrichment in left atrium, while Bmp10, a member of the TGF\u03b2 family, showed highest enrichment in right atrium. These differences were validated by RT-qPCR in murine and human tissue. Western blot showed a 2-fold left-right concentration gradient in PITX2 protein in adult human atria. Several of the genes and gene groups enriched in left atria have a known biological role for maintenance of healthy physiology, specifically the prevention of atrial pathologies involved in atrial fibrillation, including membrane electrophysiology, metabolic cellular function, and regulation of inflammatory processes. Comparison of the array datasets with published array analyses in heterozygous Pitx2c(+/-) atria suggested that approximately half of the genes with left-sided enrichment are regulated by Pitx2c.   CONCLUSIONS Our study reveals systematic differences between left and right atrial gene expression and supports the hypothesis that Pitx2c has a functional role in maintaining \"leftness\" in the atrium in adult murine and human hearts.", "citation_paragraph": "Genes coding for cytokines and cytokines receptors are found in both atria (left atrium: Ccl11, L0c100041504, Cxcl14, Ccl21c, Ccl21b, Vtn; right atrium: Dbh, Ahsg, Cd163 Cxcl13). Of note, 3 transcripts encoding the cytokine 21 ligand (isoforms b and c) were robustly and highly enriched in left atrium. It is tempting to speculate that this cytokine receptor, which regulates chemotaxis and formation of lymph nodes, may be involved in the production of myeloperoxidase in the left atrium, which has recently been linked to development of atrial fibrillation and atrial fibrosis [27] . Further studies on the role for Ccl21 in left atrial function are warranted. Consistent with this, we find other genes involved in inflammatory processes with higher expression in the left atrium: Timp4 was differentially expressed in all three data sets (Table 1) , and Alox5, C3, and Timp3 were differentially expressed in some, but not all tissues examined (Supplementary Table S1 ). The role of local inflammation in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation has long been under discussion [28, 29] , and anti-inflammatory agents can prevent postoperative atrial fibrillation [3] . Recently, alterations in the expression of Timp2 and Mmp2 have been shown to be associated with atrial fibrillation in different respects [30, 31] , with the latter enriched in left atrium in two out of three of our datasets (Supplementary Table S1 ). Other genes enriched in the left atriumAmong the 77 genes enriched in the left or right atrium in all three array experiments, 2 genes with a left-sided enrichment have a role in the blood coagulation (F13a1, Entpd2). Four left-sided genes (Fblim1, Reln, Vtn, Mfap4) and 3 right-sided genes (Emilin2, Amigo2, Vwf) code for adhesion proteins. Tcf21, Hey1, Id1, Apoe, Dbh (right atrium), and Pitx2c (left atrium) are involved in blood vessel development. Left atrial clot formation is the basis for thrombembolic stroke, one of the severe complications of atrial fibrillation. In our dataset we also found genes related to coagulation, platelet activity and thrombogenesis as being left-right differentially expressed in the atria (left atrium: Entpd2, F13a1, Vtn; right atrium: Vwf, Mrvi1, Cxcl14). Recently, Cxcl14, also known as Pf4 (platelet factor 4), was found to be slightly elevated in the left atrium of patients with atrial fibrillation [32] . Ddit4l, another highly differentially expressed gene, codes for a protein involved in DNA damage and hypoxia-induced cell death. Ppp1r1b, another gene with preferential left atrial expression, codes for a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). The catalytic subunit of PP1 and its inhibitor are implicated in the development of heart failure at the ventricular level [33, 34, 35] .

Monocytes can dynamically adapt to different TLR agonists inducing different patterns of inflammatory response, and the sequence of exposure to TLRs can dramatically modulate cell activation. Understanding the interactions between TLR signalling that lead to synergy, priming and tolerance to TLR agonists may help explain how prior infections and inflammatory conditioning can regulate the innate immune response to subsequent infections. Our goal was to investigate the role of MyD88-independent/dependent TLR priming on modulating the monocyte response to LPS exposure. We stimulated human blood monocytes with agonists for TLR4 (LPS), TLR3 (poly(I:C)) and TLR7/8 (R848) and subsequently challenged them to low doses of endotoxin. The different TLR agonists promoted distinct inflammatory signatures in monocytes. Upon subsequent LPS challenge, LPS- and R848-primed monocytes did not enhance the previous response, whereas poly(I:C)-primed monocytes exhibited a significant inflammatory response concomitant with a sharp reduction on cell viability. Our results show that TLR3-primed monocytes are prompted to cell death by apoptosis in the presence of low endotoxin levels, concurrent with the production of high levels of TNF\u03b1 and IL6. Of note, blocking of TNFR I/II in those monocytes did reduce TNF\u03b1 production but did not abrogate cell death. Instead, direct signalling through TLR4 was responsible of such effect. Collectively, our study provides new insights on the effects of cross-priming and synergism between TLR3 and TLR4, identifying the selective induction of apoptosis as a strategy for TLR-mediated host innate response.", "citation_paragraph": "Given this profound effect on cell viability, we next explored which type of cell death was triggered by low dose LPS on poly(I:C)-primed monocytes (Fig. 5a ). The descent in the percentage of viable cells according to only PI labelling was similar for both non-and poly(I:C)-primed monocytes (Fig. 5b) , suggesting that necrosis was not fostered. The difference between the two priming conditions was actually found when the monocytes' mitochondrial function was analyzed. An increase in cell death according to DiOC6(3) staining in poly(I:C)-primed monocytes compared to non-primed monocytes was observed already at 5 h after LPS addition (Fig. 5b) .As these results were suggestive of apoptosis induction, we next examined the effect of the pan-caspases inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk on the viability of monocytes. The addition of Z-VAD-fmk prevented the cell death fostered by poly(I: C) priming of monocytes after sequential LPS exposure (Fig. 5c ), indicating thus an apoptotic cell death of monocytes sequentially activated with poly(I:C) and LPS.To further discard caspase-independent types of programmed cell death, necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) was added to cell culture.

Meanwhile, non-coding RNAs have been established as key players in regulating various biological and pathological processes, such as cell-cycle progression, chromatin remodeling, gene transcription, and posttranscriptional processing. Furthermore, numerous studies have also revealed a complicated interplay among different species of non-coding RNAs; therefore, the cross-regulation between long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) has begun to emerge. This lncRNA-miRNA cross talk, which has attracted increasing attention in recent years, is involved in a great number of human diseases including gastric cancer.

A single mRNA can be regulated by a number of miRNAs, and a single miRNA can regulate multiple mRNAs [1, 2] . As each miRNA may repress a large number of transcripts, it is estimated that miRNAs regulate a large proportion of the transcriptome [2] [3] [4] . Every miRNA target contains MREs (miRNA response elements), to which miRNAs are attracted, resulting in down regulation of the target (Figure 1(a) ). The miRNAs bind to partially complementary sequences in the 3 untranslated region (UTR) of the target mRNA and result in its repression mediated by Argonaute (Ago) proteins [1, 4] . The concentration of the miRNA targets is an important factor that determines the availability of free miRNA within cells as higher concentration of miRNAtargets is indicative of lower availability of free miRNAs [5] . The activity of the miRNAs can be affected by the presence of competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), vying for the miRNAs with shared MREs [6, 7] .

ABSTRACT The brain was long considered an organ that underwent very little change after development. It is now well established that the mammalian central nervous system contains neural stem cells that generate progeny that are capable of making new neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes throughout life. The field has advanced rapidly as it strives to understand the basic biology of these precursor cells, and explore their potential to promote brain repair. The purpose of this review is to present current knowledge about the diversity of neural stem cells in vitro and in vivo, and highlight distinctions between neural stem cell populations, throughout development, and within the niche. A comprehensive understanding of neural stem cell heterogeneity will provide insights into the cellular and molecular regulation of neural development and lifelong neurogenesis, and will guide the development of novel strategies to promote regeneration and neural repair.", "citation_paragraph": "A critique of all cell culture systems is that they are highly artificial with no spatial organization or specific cell-cell interactions (Conti and Cattaneo, 2010) . Since neural stem cells are never truly isolated in vivo, the in vitro findings may not be representative of the whole organism, which is heavily influenced by the neurogenic microenvironment (Song et al., 2002) . Conversely, it is important to remember that primary cell culture does contain some niche components, such as neural cell types, blood cells, endothelial cells, microglia, macrophages and ependymal cells, and that pure NPC populations arise only upon passaging, filtration, or other isolation and cell sorting methods (Conti et al., 2005) . Although it can be challenging to tease apart if phenomena observed in vivo are due to the influence of the niche or a result of inherent NPC properties, in vitro studies such as the neurosphere assay can be quite elegant to demonstrate NPC behaviour after passaging and in the absence of the niche (Emsley et al., 2005) . Even without the niche, neither neurospheres nor monolayers directly from primary dissection are an entirely pure population of NSCs (Reynolds and Weiss, 1992; Conti et al., 2005; Pollard et al., 2006) . Still, these in vitro systems remain important tools to assess functional criteria of neural stem cells, and, together with progressively refined purification techniques, we can aim to achieve high throughput analyses such that these single-cell and population analyses will inform one another, and that will enable us to distinguish between stem cells and progeny in the future.", "citance": "Conversely, it is important to remember that primary cell culture does contain some niche components, such as neural cell types, blood cells, endothelial cells, microglia, macrophages and ependymal cells, and that pure NPC populations arise only upon passaging, filtration, or other isolation and cell sorting methods (Conti et al., 2005) .", "claims": [{"text": "Pure neural progenitor cell (NPC) populations can only be obtained from cell cultures that undergo passaging, filtration, or other isolation and cell sorting methods.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

RNA interference (RNAi) plays an important role in antiviral immunity, gene regulation and protection from transposable elements. Double-stranded RNA binding proteins (dsRBPs) are important for efficient RNAi; in Drosophila functional specialization of the miRNA, endo-siRNA and exo-siRNA pathway is aided by the dsRBPs Loquacious (Loqs-PB, Loqs-PD) and R2D2, respectively. However, this functional specialization has not been investigated in other dipterans. We were unable to detect Loqs-PD in Ae. aegypti; analysis of other dipteran genomes demonstrated that this isoform is not conserved outside of Drosophila. Overexpression experiments and small RNA sequencing following depletion of each dsRBP revealed that R2D2 and Loqs-PA cooperate non-redundantly in siRNA production, and that these proteins exhibit an inhibitory effect on miRNA levels. Conversely, Loqs-PB alone interacted with mosquito dicer-1 and was essential for full miRNA production. Mosquito Loqs interacted with both argonaute 1 and 2 in a manner independent of its interactions with dicer. We conclude that the functional specialization of Loqs-PD in Drosophila is a recently derived trait, and that in other dipterans, including the medically important mosquitoes, Loqs-PA participates in both the miRNA and endo-siRNA based pathways.", "citation_paragraph": "Over the past few years, substantial evidence has accumulated that the model dipteran, D. melanogaster, uses alternative splicing to functionally segregate miRNA-and endosiRNA-based responsibilities of the hub protein, Loqs. DmLoqs-PA and -PB isoforms both partner with DmDcr1 in miRNA biogenesis, while DmLoqs-PD partners with DmDcr2 to process various classes of endo-siRNAs. Loqs null flies are not viable; while Loqs-PA can rescue viability, only Loqs-PB can rescue fly fertility (13) , and this isoform is thought to be more essential for miRNA processing (10, 14) , as it interacts much more readily with Dcr1 (12) . In contrast, DmLoqs-PD protein partners with DmDcr2 and is important to endo-siRNA biogenesis (13) (14) (15) 19) . We examined the conservation of these segregated functions in other diptera. Surprisingly, genomic comparisons revealed that the ability to generate Loqs-PD isoforms was not conserved in other dipterans, and despite repeated attempts, a Loqs-PD form could not be detected in the mosquito Ae. aegypti. Given its absence in both mosquitoes and sandflies, two of the oldest dipteran groups, along with the fact that drosophilids are known to be a much more recent radiation (36), our results suggest that the functional segregation of loqs' responsibilities is a derived trait, restricted to drosophilids.Instead, we observed that in mosquito cells, Loqs-PA plays a complex role in regulating endo-siRNA, exo-siRNA and miRNA levels but largely cooperates non-redundantly with R2D2. Overexpression of Loqs-PA, but not Loqs-PB, increased the ability of mosquito cells to silence an inverted repeat construct, while loss of all Loqs isoforms disrupted small RNA levels from exogenous and endogenous sources in a manner similar to R2D2 depletion. Biochemical evidence has shown that in Drosophila, both R2D2 and Loqs-PD can decrease the substrate concentration at which Dicer effectively processes dsRNA (13, 35) . Interestingly, overexpression of R2D2 increased the ability of mosquito cells to silence a target triggered by exogenous dsRNA. This is somewhat surprising, given that R2D2 is not stable unless bound by Dcr2 (37) . However, we found that Dcr2 was substantially overexpressed in Aag2 cells, while levels of R2D2 mRNA were much lower than found in adult mosquitoes. Thus, our overexpression experiment more closely resembled that of a rescue of R2D2, and likely resulted in additional R2D2/Dcr2 heterodimers in place of unpaired Dcr2. Combined with our observations that R2D2 and Loqs-PA are both required for proper small RNA levels, our overexpression data may suggest that silencing of our endo-siRNA and exo-siRNA reporters are limited by independent bottlenecks. It has been long known that single-stranded ends on double-stranded RNA molecules inhibit processing by Dcr (38) . Thus, the bottleneck in processing endo-siRNAs may be more effectively relieved by Loqs, consistent with the mechanism proposed by Marques (18) . Processing perfect dsRNA may not require this extra help, resulting in a bottleneck in loading-a role primarily assigned to R2D2 (37) .In Drosophila, R2D2 partners with Dcr2 and enables loading of small interfering viral RNAs (viRNAs) in the Ago2 effector complex. Co-immunoprecipitation of AaDcr2 with AaR2D2 supports conservation of this function in mosquitoes and agrees with previous observations that depletion of AaR2D2 can increase viral replication in infected mosquitoes (8) and is critical for the anti-viral exosiRNA response in flies (39) . However, depletion of R2D2 did not alter the abundance of small RNAs derived from a persistently infecting flavivirus (CFAV), whereas CFAV small RNAs did decrease upon knockdown of Loqs, sug- gesting a potential role for mosquito Loqs in antiviral immunity.Loss of R2D2 has been reported to increase the abundance of miRNAs, suggesting a potential antagonistic relationship between these two dsRBPs (18) . However, the authors of that study were guarded in their interpretation due to a lack of biological replicates and appropriate normalization methods. Using replicate libraries and modern normalization methods, we also observed a strong antagonistic relationship between R2D2 and Loqs-PB concerning the generation of miRNAs. Thus, we conclude that R2D2 restricts miRNA production, potentially though increasing the selectivity of Dcr2 for long dsRNA (35) . Interestingly, depletion of all Loqs isoforms was not nearly as disruptive to miRNA levels as depletion of Loqs-PB alone. This suggests an additional layer of competition between Loqs-PA and Loqs-PB, with Loqs-PA able to inhibit miRNA production similar to R2D2. Hartig and Forstemann (16) reported competition between Loqs-PA/PB and Loqs-PD as overexpression of the former decreased the production of endo-siRNA CG4068B, while overexpression of Loqs-PD increased endo-siRNA expression. An additional complication is that depletion of Loqs, but not Loqs-PB or R2D2 resulted in a substantial increase in siRNA production from both protein-coding genes and transposons. This suggests that Loqs-PA may also antagonize the endosiRNA pathway in some cases, essentially serving as gatekeeper to prevent the dicing of unintended substrates. Both AaLoqs-PA and -PB likely participate in other proteinprotein interactions that further regulate their role in RNAi, as both the Drosophila Loqs protein and the human orthologs PACT/TRBP are known hub proteins with large interaction networks (32, 40) .Both AaLoqs isoforms were able to interact with native Dcr2, Ago1 and Ago2, whereas only AaLoqs-PB was observed to interact with Dcr1, again suggesting a role for AaLoqs in both the miRNA and the siRNA pathways of mosquitoes. The interactions we observed between Loqs and AaAgo1/AaAgo2 suggest a role beyond simply processing dsRNA. As in Drosophila, we did not recover AaR2D2 in complex with AaAgo2, suggesting that its well-defined role in siRNA loading does not require a stable interaction with Ago (this is mediated through Dcr2). Drosophila Loqs also interacts with Ago1 (41) and human TRBP is a well-established component of the RISC (32) . We were able to map the interaction domain of Ae. aegypti Loqs for Ago1/Ago2 to the short linker sequence between the second and third dsRNA-binding domains. This appears to be independent from the interaction domain between DmLoqs and Dcr1 (third DSRM) (14) and the interaction domain we observed for binding Dcr2, the latter of which was still able to bind Loqs with just the first and second DSRMs present.The third loqs isoform we identified, loqs-rc, consisting of exons 1, 2, 6 and 7, does not resemble any of the previously described drosophilid isoforms. While we were able to recover several cDNA clones of the loqs-rc splice variant, we were unable to express an HA-tagged version of this protein in Aag2 cells, either through recombinant virus or through plasmid transfection. This is somewhat reminiscent of the drosophilid loqs-rc splice variant, which was only detectable in S2 cells and had no detectable protein product (11, 15) . As this product was also barely detectable by PCR of various tissues, its biological significance is questionable.In addition to their roles in post-transcriptional gene silencing, several RNAi proteins perform functions in the cell nucleus [reviewed by Castel and Martienssen (42) ]. In plants and fungi, RNAi-based silencing inhibits not only translation, but also occurs at the transcriptional level by regulating heterochromatin formation. Transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) occurs when epigenetic modifications, such as histone methylation, occur at target genomic loci in response to nuclear RNAi. The specific mechanisms by which RNAi can regulate TGS are not completely known and likely vary by species. Cernilogar et al. (43) found that both Ago2 and Dcr2 associate with RNA polymerase II and transcriptionally active loci in euchromatin to negatively regulate transcription by inhibiting RNA polymerase II activity. In particular, their research revealed a role for these RNAi components in the heat shock response (43) . Additionally, a recent study by Taliaferro et al., suggested that depletion of Ago2 affected pre-mRNA splicing patterns, based on genome-wide screens (44) . Our subcellular fractionation assays support a potential role for the RNAi component Ago2 in the mosquito cell nucleus, as well as the miRNA components Ago1/Dcr1, and both isoforms of Loqs. In contrast, the RNAi components Dcr2 and R2D2 were restricted to the cell cytoplasm, suggesting their roles might be more limited in mosquitoes. Further studies are needed to clarify the roles of both siRNA and miRNA factors in the mosquito nucleus.In summary, our experiments have revealed an unexpected twist in the story of how double-stranded RNA binding proteins interact with RNAi factors across various invertebrate taxa. Our results suggest that the wellcharacterized Drosophila Loqs-PD isoform is a derived trait, essentially a specialized form of the ancestral Loqs-PA isoform. In other diptera, Loqs-PA has maintained a generally cooperative role with R2D2 and Dcr2 in siRNA production (exogenous and endogenous) while largely antagonizing Loqs-PB in miRNA production. Loqs-PA also appears to serve as a gatekeeper, keeping protein-coding mRNAs from entering the siRNA pathway. How Loqs-PA balances synergistic and antagonistic functions related to RNAi remains unknown. The ability to perform sitespecific gene editing (23) should allow us to address the functional role of these proteins in RNAi directly in other dipterans such as mosquitoes and resolve these interesting questions.", "citance": "Thus, we conclude that R2D2 restricts miRNA production, potentially though increasing the selectivity of Dcr2 for long dsRNA (35) .", "claims": [{"text": "R2D2 stops miRNA production by increasing the selectivity of Dcr2 for long dsRNA.", "subject": "R2D2 ", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 145032389, "title": null, "abstract": null, "citation_paragraph": "The maintenance of telomeres is critical for the genomic stability and sustained survival of proliferating cells (Artandi and DePinho, 2010; Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011; Palm and de Lange, 2008; Verdun and Karlseder, 2007) . Telomerase, an RNA-templated enzyme that extends telomeres, plays a crucial role in telomere maintenance. To bypass replicative senescence during tumorigenesis, telomerase is activated in the majority of human cancers (Shay, 2016) . However, about 10%-15% of human cancers use a telomerase-independent but recombination-dependent pathway to maintain telomeres (Dilley and Greenberg, 2015; Heaphy et al., 2011; Reddel, 2014) . This pathway, which is referred to as alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT), is a potential therapeutic target in cancers lacking telomerase activity. Although a number of DNA repair and recombination proteins have been implicated in ALT, the molecular process through which ALT occurs is still poorly understood (Cesare and Reddel, 2010; . Furthermore, although several common features of ALT-positive (ALT + ) cells are widely used to assess the ALT status, whether and how these ALT features are mechanistically linked to the process of ALT remains largely unclear. A better understanding of the framework of the ALT pathway and the molecular mechanisms underlying the hallmarks of ALT will greatly facilitate the characterizations and targeting of ALT + cancers.One of the hallmarks of ALT is ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs) (Yeager et al., 1999) . In ALT + cells, APBs containing both telomeres and PML are enriched in the G2 phase of the cell cycle (Grobelny et al., 2000) . High-resolution imaging studies revealed telomere clusters around PML bodies (Draskovic et al., 2009) . Furthermore, a number of DNA repair and recombination proteins, including RPA, RAD51, RAD52, BLM, and others, were detected in APBs, raising the possibility that APBs provide a ''recombinogenic microenvironment'' to promote ALT (Acharya et al., 2014; Lillard-Wetherell et al., 2004; Nabetani et al., 2004; O'Sullivan et al., 2014; Potts and Yu, 2007; Stavropoulos et al., 2002; Wu et al., 2000; Yeager et al., 1999) . Despite these tantalizing observations, it still remains unclear whether ALT DNA synthesis occurs specifically in APBs and whether APBs are essential for ALT DNA synthesis.In addition to APBs, ALT + cells are also characteristic for harboring higher levels of extrachromosomal telomeric DNA circles, especially single-stranded C-rich circles (C-circles) (Cesare and Griffith, 2004; Henson et al., 2009; Nabetani and Ishikawa, 2009; Ogino et al., 1998; Tokutake et al., 1998; Wang et al., 2004) . C-circle levels correlate with the levels of telomere DNA synthesis in ALT + cells, and high C-circle abundance is widely used as a marker for ALT activation (O'Sullivan et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2015) . Nonetheless, how C-circles are generated during ALT remains elusive. ALT has been long speculated to be a recombination-based process (Dunham et al., 2000) . In the budding yeast, the survival of telomerase null cells relies on two distinct recombination pathways (types I and II survivors) (Le et al., 1999) . Although both pathways require Rad52, only one (type I survivors) depends on Rad51 (Chen et al., 2001 ). Both of the yeast pathways also require Pol32, a subunit of DNA polymerase d critical for break-induced DNA replication (BIR) (Lydeard et al., 2007) . replication stress-associated and BIR-related process. Depletion of ASF1 induces replication stress at telomeres and a spectrum of ALT-associated phenotypes (O'Sullivan et al., 2014) . Induction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) at telomeres elicits robust DNA synthesis through a process requiring POLD3, the counterpart of the yeast Pol32 (Dilley et al., 2016) . In ALT + cells, overexpression of BLM promotes extension of telomeres in a POLD3-dependent manner . Depletion of POLD3 or it associated partner POLD4 in ALT + cells led to a reduction in conservatively replicated telomeres, indicating their involvement in ALT (Roumelioti et al., 2016) . Furthermore, the levels of mitotic DNA synthesis (MiDAS) at telomeres are elevated in ALT + cells (Min et al., 2017) . Telomeric MiDAS is dependent on RAD52, which is also implicated in BIR (Bhowmick et al., 2016; Min et al., 2017; \u00d6 zer et al., 2018; Sotiriou et al., 2016) . Despite the similarities between ALT and BIR, some BIR factors are not required for telomere DNA synthesis in ALT + cells when analyzed with different assays (\u00d6 zer et al., 2018; . Together, these findings suggest that ALT is likely triggered by replication-associated telomere breaks and occur through a BIR-like process. Although ALT is linked to BIR, it is still poorly understood as a pathway. Importantly, naturally occurring DNA synthesis at ALT telomeres is temporally and spatially regulated during the cell cycle. Telomeric DNA synthesis was observed in G2 and mitotic ALT + cells, presenting opportunities to detect ALT activity (Dilley et al., 2016; Min et al., 2017; Nabetani et al., 2004; \u00d6 zer et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2000) . Assays that directly visualize the ALT DNA synthesis at unperturbed telomeres are critical for delineating the mechanisms of ALT and the cellular circuitries regulating this process.In this study, we developed an assay to visualize telomere DNA synthesis in APBs formed in G2 human cells. The DNA synthesis detected by this assay is specific to ALT + cells and regulated by known ALT factors. Using this assay, we found that ALT DNA synthesis occurs exclusively in APBs and is dependent on PML. Furthermore, RAD52 but not RAD51 is required for efficient ALT DNA synthesis. RAD52 is not only required for maintaining telomeres in ALT + cells but also sufficient to promote telomeric D-loop formation in vitro, explaining its role in BIR at ALT telomeres. Surprisingly, however, RAD52 is not required for C-circle formation, suggesting the presence of a RAD52-independent ALT pathway. In RAD52-knockout cells, telomeres were progressively shortened, but C-circle formation and residual ALT DNA synthesis were gradually increased. These RAD52-independent ALT activities are dependent on BLM and POLD3/4, suggesting that the second ALT pathway is also mediated by BIR. Together, these results suggest that ALT is mediated by two BIR-related pathways, one RAD52 dependent and the other RAD52 independent. These findings establish a bifurcated framework of the ALT pathway, setting the stage for future investigations to dissect the molecular events in this process.", "citance": "Telomeric MiDAS is dependent on RAD52, which is also implicated in BIR (Bhowmick et al., 2016; Min et al., 2017; \u00d6 zer et al., 2018; Sotiriou et al., 2016) .", "claims": [{"text": "RAD52 is involved in break-induced DNA replication (BIR).", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 2135855, "title": "Enhancement of an anti-tumor immune response by transient blockade of central T cell tolerance", "abstract": "Thymic central tolerance is a critical process that prevents autoimmunity but also presents a challenge to the generation of anti-tumor immune responses. Medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) eliminate self-reactive T cells by displaying a diverse repertoire of tissue-specific antigens (TSAs) that are also shared by tumors. Therefore, while protecting against autoimmunity, mTECs simultaneously limit the generation of tumor-specific effector T cells by expressing tumor self-antigens. This ectopic expression of TSAs largely depends on autoimmune regulator (Aire), which is expressed in mature mTECs. Thus, therapies to deplete Aire-expressing mTECs represent an attractive strategy to increase the pool of tumor-specific effector T cells. Recent work has implicated the TNF family members RANK and RANK-Ligand (RANKL) in the development of Aire-expressing mTECs. We show that in vivo RANKL blockade selectively and transiently depletes Aire and TSA expression in the thymus to create a window of defective negative selection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RANKL blockade can rescue melanoma-specific T cells from thymic deletion and that persistence of these tumor-specific effector T cells promoted increased host survival in response to tumor challenge. These results indicate that modulating central tolerance through RANKL can alter thymic output and potentially provide therapeutic benefit by enhancing anti-tumor immunity.", "citation_paragraph": "The RANK-RANKL signaling pathway is important for mTEC development, but it remains unclear what impact perturbation of this pathway might have on the adult thymus. Previous work has linked the RANK-RANKL pathway to the development of Aire-expressing mTECs (Rossi et al., 2007; Akiyama et al., 2008; Hikosaka et al., 2008; Roberts et al., 2012) , and we hypothesized that treating mice with blocking anti-RANKL antibody would decrease Aire + mTECs. therapeutic window for the generation of T cells capable of recognizing tumor self-antigens. Many current cancer immune therapies rely on activating relatively weak tumor-specific T cell responses through modulating peripheral tolerance (Swann and Smyth, 2007; Chen and Mellman, 2013) . In contrast, manipulation of central tolerance has the potential to increase the pool and affinity of effector T cells that can recognize and contribute to effective anti-tumor responses. Furthermore, such high-affinity, self-reactive T cells may be more resistant to peripheral tolerance mechanisms that typically restrain an antitumor response (Swann and Smyth, 2007) . Thus, the development of methods that selectively and transiently deplete Aire-expressing mTECs may be an attractive method to enhance tumor-specific immune responses.Previous work has identified agents that can inhibit the growth and development of TECs such as corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and some inflammatory cytokines (Anz et al., 2009; Fletcher et al., 2009) . Despite their clear inhibitory effects on TECs, however, these agents do not appear to have selectivity for blocking mTEC development. Interestingly, recent studies have demonstrated a role for TNF family member pairs RANK-RANKL and CD40-CD40L in the embryological development of Aire + mTECs (Rossi et al., 2007; Akiyama et al., 2008; Hikosaka et al., 2008; Roberts et al., 2012) . Recent work Br ief Definitive Repor t corticomedullary thymic architecture despite these changes in TEC cellularity and mTEC composition (Fig. 2 D) .Collectively, these data suggest that RANK-RANKL-OPG interactions regulate both TEC cellularity and mTEC maturation, and are particularly important for the induction of Aire + mTECs.

The composition of the proteome is adjusted to the specific requirements of a particular cell type and status. Moreover, multiple metabolic and environmental conditions challenge the integrity of the proteome. To maintain the quality of the proteome, the proteostasis network monitors proteins from their synthesis through their degradation. Whereas somatic stem cells lose their ability to maintain proteostasis with age, immortal pluripotent stem cells exhibit a stringent proteostasis network associated with their biological function and intrinsic characteristics. Moreover, growing evidence indicates that enhanced proteostasis mechanisms play a central role in immortality and cell fate decisions of pluripotent stem cells. Here, we will review new insights into the melding fields of proteostasis and pluripotency and their implications for the understanding of organismal development and survival.", "citation_paragraph": "Protein translation is a fundamental step of gene expression by which ribosomes decode mRNAs to synthesize new proteins as linear chains of amino acids [1] . Protein translation consists of three phases: initiation, elongation, and termination. Regulation of protein synthesis can occur at any phase of translation and it may be either specific for distinct transcripts or specific for global. For instance, phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2A\u03b1 impairs the recruitment of the Met-tRNA to the 40S ribosome subunit, resulting in down-regulation of global translational rates [20, 21] . Protein translation is differentially regulated among distinct cell types, a process that contributes to establish and maintain differences in cell identity and function [22] .Given that protein synthesis rates impinge upon multiple biological processes that determine cell identity and status, this process is tightly regulated. For instance, the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation crucially depends on activation or repression of protein translation [22] . Several studies in animal models demonstrate that changes in global translational rates are essential to facilitate transition into differentiated states. This is the case of mouse haematopoietic stem cells, which require enhanced protein synthesis to maintain their stemness [23] . In Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, precise regulation of translational rates influences the function and proliferation of immortal germline stem cells (GSCs), which are designed to generate gametes for reproduction and maintain an unlimited proliferative capacity [24] [25] [26] [27] . Given their biological function and particular characteristics, ESCs must have intrinsic regulatory mechanisms to control protein translation (Fig. 1) . Emerging evidence indicates that ESCs exhibit high demand for increased translational rates to sustain their elevated self-renewal activity and pluripotency [19] . In mouse ESCs (mESCs), down-regulation of global protein synthesis rates results in loss of pluripotency as observed with either translational inhibitors or knockdown of genes involved in ribosome biogenesis [19] . Moreover, this study showed that the high global translational rates of mESCs decrease during their differentiation into either embryoid bodies or neural cells [19] . General up-regulation of translation in mESCs is linked with their elevated expression of several subunits (e.g., Ddx47, Krr1) of the small subunit processome (SSUP), a complex that mediates 18S rRNA biogenesis and intensify global protein synthesis [19] . Concomitantly, knockdown of distinct SSUP components impairs 40S ribosome biogenesis in mESCs. Pluripotency factors such as Nanog promote the high expression of SSUP subunits in mESCs, providing a direct link between pluripotency and elevated protein synthesis [19] . In addition, the translation of ribosomal proteins itself undergoes a strong repression when mESCs differentiate into embryoid bodies [28] . While ribosomal protein genes are highly expressed in embryoid bodies, their transcripts are translated less efficiently than the typical mRNAs. In support of a link between enhanced protein synthesis and pluripotency, mESCs produce high levels of pre-rRNA by maintaining the rDNA promoter in an unmethylated state [29] . Whether the aforementioned regulatory mechanisms are evolutionary conserved in human ESCs (hESCs) and iPSCs remained to be elucidated. However, it is important to note that other findings do not support a model of increased global translational rates in ESCs. A previous study indicated that protein translation is parsimonious in mESCs, whereas the global loading of mRNAs in translating polysomes increases during early differentiation into embryoid bodies, resulting in increased protein synthesis and content [30] . This process is modulated by increased phosphorylation of 4EBP1 through activation of the mTOR pathway in embryoid bodies, resulting in the release of active eIF4E complexes that up-regulate global translation [30] . Moreover, mESCs also exhibit an intrinsic translation of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) by which these cells precisely regulate protein synthesis to impact gene expression genome-wide. uORFs are central regulators of gene expression located in the 5\u2032UTR of the mRNA and, therefore, precede the initiation codon of the main codon region [31] . When translation starts from the uORF, protein synthesis of the actual ORF is impaired [31] . Interestingly, mESCs display increased uORF translation compared with their differentiated counterparts [28] . Given that approximately, half of the human transcripts possess uORFs [31] , this process could also play an important role in the regulation of global translational rates of hESCs.Remarkably, post-transcriptional modifications of RNA modulate ESC identity and cell fate decisions. N6-methyladenosine (m 6 A), the most abundant post-transcriptional modification in RNA [32] , is involved in all aspects of RNA metabolism, including mRNA turnover [33, 34] and translation efficiency [35] . Whereas several studies propose proteins, pluripotent stem cell function requires increased expression of chaperone core machinery genes. In addition, the intrinsic chaperome network of pluripotent stem cells maintains the proper folded state of proteins from their synthesis through their degradation, resulting in decreased accumulation of damaged/misfolded proteins and aggregates. Although differentiated cells exhibit decreased translational rates, a concomitant down-regulation in the chaperone/ folding system diminishes their ability to refold damaged/misfolded proteins and restrain protein aggregation that m 6 A modifications are required to maintain ESC identity [17, 34] , other findings suggest that m 6 A determines ESC commitment to differentiated states [35, 36] . Notably, the chromatin-associated zinc finger protein 217 (ZFP217) modulates the global levels of m 6 A in ESCs. ZFP217 interacts with epigenetic modulators to activate the transcription of multiple core pluripotency factors while reduces m 6 A deposition on these pro-pluripotency transcripts to promote their translation [17] . Likewise, growing evidence indicates that distinct RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) also play central roles in hESC identity and cell fate decisions. RBPs participate in practically any step of gene expression involving RNA such as turnover and translation [18] . One of the most studied RBPs in the context of pluripotency is LIN28, which is highly expressed in ESCs to regulate the stability and translation of hundreds of mRNAs that define ESC identity [37] .Taken together, global protein synthesis rates as well as post-transcriptional co-regulation of functionally related genes determine ESC identity. However, there are still many intriguing aspects to be examined in the field. Moreover, most of the studies used mESCs as a primary model, whereas translational regulatory mechanisms remain largely unknown in human pluripotent stem cells. Thus, it will be particularly fascinating to define how human pluripotent stem cells regulate global translational rates and their changes during cell differentiation/reprogramming.", "citance": "RBPs participate in practically any step of gene expression involving RNA such as turnover and translation [18] .", "claims": [{"text": "RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are involved the majority of steps involving gene expression.", "subject": "RNA-binding proteins ", "is_negation": false}]}

This mechanism also provide defense against viruses and transposable material to maintain the genome integrity [1] . There has been increasing interest to harness this mechanism to silence a specific mRNA. RNAi is triggered whenever a cell encounter long dsRNA molecules and subsequently cleave them into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) using Dicer enzyme. siRNA is ,21 nucleotide (nt) long dsRNA having 2 nt overhang on 39-end. Afterward, siRNA unwound and one strand associated with nuclease-containing protein complex (RISC).

Importantly, it makes feasible for large-scale functional genomics studies. It has been shown that knockdown effect (efficacy) of siRNA is varying according to target site on mRNA and hence, very limited set of siRNAs show high efficacy [3] .

However, studies have shown that siRNA behaves like miRNA and suppress protein synthesis when it is not fully complementary to the target, indicating mismatches are allowed during target selection by siRNA [2, 11] . This phenomenon also raised very important problem about off-target effect where unintended target genes suppressed by siRNA [12, 13, 14] . A study indicates that seed region of siRNA, 2-8 nt from 59-end, is important for target finding and single mismatch within seed region can change the off-target transcripts without effecting silencing efficiency of original target transcript [14] . Initially offtarget sequences were searched using similarity based methods against mRNA sequence database but the strategy was not successful due to lack of knowledge about level of sequence similarity required for off-target effect. To understand the silencing effect of mismatch between siRNA and target, several studies were conducted [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21] . The study by Du et al. reveals position of the mismatch generated in the target influence silencing and categorized them as; (a) High tolerance: mismatch at position 1, 2, 18, or 19, which does not affect the efficacy. (b) Low tolerance: mismatch at position 5-11 which results into abolishing the RNAi activity and remain position is (c) of moderate tolerance [15] . It also showed the impact of mismatched nucleotide and found A:C and G:U are well tolerated mismatch. Furthermore the silencing effect of double-nucleotide mismatches were also studied [17] . Recently, a very systematic study was conducted by using 20 siRNAs against 400 various mismatched targets to generate a model for single nucleotide-mismatch [21] . This study analyzed all combinations of mismatched siRNA:target and demonstrated that efficacy can be influenced by position and type of nucleotide mismatched. The work also demonstrated that most tolerant mismatch was A:C while least one was A:G in term of siRNA: target. It was observed that swapping of mismatched nucleotides at some position dramatically changed the efficacy e.g. at position 17 of siRNA both A:C and C:A mismatched are well tolerated while at position 12 only A:C mismatch is tolerated not C:A. However, study also demonstrated the importance of creating mismatch between sense and antisense strand of siRNA in order to make more asymmetric siRNA which leads to improve silencing efficacy [20] . In order to find off target sequence, methods has been developed which incorporate features like seed complementary region and nucleotide mismatch to predict potential off-targets [22] . To the best of author's knowledge, lack of specificity of siRNA is considered as major drawback in designing any siRNA based therapy.Investigation indicates that a large portion in mRNA could not be targeted for siRNA because of having low efficacy [3] . Thus, it makes limited choice for selecting target site. Furthermore, the requirement to enhance efficacy of a siRNA against particular target site is not fulfilled by available methods. In this study, we have examined whether weakness of siRNA (poor specificity) can be exploited to design mutant siRNA of desired efficacy. It is well known that all siRNAs is not equally effective even if they are fully complementary to mRNA. On the other side, we also know from experimental studies that few mismatches at specific position can be tolerated. Based on this hypothesis a prediction method has been developed for designing effective mismatch siRNA against mRNA.This study having two sections: (1) The development of a model for predicting siRNA efficacy, and (2) The creation of mutation in the siRNA sequence to enhance its efficacy.

{"s2orc_id": 14374627, "title": "Solving the Telomere Replication Problem", "abstract": "Telomeres are complex nucleoprotein structures that protect the extremities of linear chromosomes. Telomere replication is a major challenge because many obstacles to the progression of the replication fork are concentrated at the ends of the chromosomes. This is known as the telomere replication problem. In this article, different and new aspects of telomere replication, that can threaten the integrity of telomeres, will be reviewed. In particular, we will focus on the functions of shelterin and the replisome for the preservation of telomere integrity.", "citation_paragraph": "The T-loop, where the 3 overhang of telomeres invades the double-stranded part of the telomeric repeats through strand displacement to form a D-loop, participates in telomere protection, but also represents an obstacle to the progression of the replication fork. Mechanisms that dismantle the T-loop to allow the telomerase access to the 3 overhang and to avoid collision with the replisome during the S phase are therefore necessary (Figure 2 ). In addition to its ability to unwind G4, RTEL1 is involved in T-loop disassembly during DNA replication [45, 81] . For this function, RTEL1 recruitment requires a direct interaction with TRF2 through a C4C4 motif [82] . While it is established that RTEL1 associates with the replisome through PCNA binding to promote telomere and genome wide replication [47] , the TRF2-RTEL1 interaction is likely to be tightly controlled to anticipate T-loop dissolution prior to the arrival of the replication fork. In future studies, it would be interesting to further define how RTEL1 interactions with PCNA and TRF2 are coordinated throughout the cell cycle, in order to discriminate between different replication barriers such as G4, T-loops, or other barriers. It is currently unknown whether RTEL1 itself is subject to post-translational modifications. However, potential phosphorylation sites found in TRF2 might be important for the mediation of the RTEL1-TRF2 interaction [83] .In the absence of RTEL1, T-loops are inappropriately resolved by the SLX1-SLX4 nucleases, leading to catastrophic telomere events such as t-circle formation and rapid telomere shortening [45] . However, RTEL1 might not be the sole helicase involved in T-loop disassembly. WRN and BLM are also capable of dissociating telomeric D-loop in vitro [43, 84] , and these two helicases are known to interact directly with TRF2 [42, 43] and POT1 [85] . T-loop resolution might also involve an additional member of the RECQ helicase family, RECQL4, which is mutated in the Rothmund-Thomson syndrome [86] .The resolution of complex structures at chromosome ends relies on several helicases, while the SLX1-SLX4 nucleases seem to be used as a last resort. Indeed, the shelterin protein TRF2 seems to play a key role in recruiting and/or stimulating WRN, BLM, and RTEL1 helicases to disassemble the T-loop [42, 43, 82] . It is likely that many other actors involved in this process remain to be identified. Now, we need to discover how the cell orchestrates T-loop resolution when the replication fork approaches, and the nature of the cellular signal that triggers T-loop disassembly. Notably, TRF2 also functions with the Apollo 5 -exonuclease, to protect telomeres [87, 88] . It is currently unknown whether Apollo is involved in T-loop resolution, nevertheless, it prevents the formation of topological constraints by the removal of superhelical stress, caused by the nucleoprotein complex that stabilizes the base of the T-loop [29] . Mechanisms that orchestrate T-loop resolution are likely to rely on a complex network of post-translational modifications, presumably involving the shelterin proteins. This may represent an active area of investigation in future.", "citance": "For this function, RTEL1 recruitment requires a direct interaction with TRF2 through a C4C4 motif [82] .", "claims": [{"text": "RTEL1 interacts with TRF2 through a C4C4 motif", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 92284532, "title": "Bioinformatic Software Library for Circadian Analysis", "abstract": "Author(s): Ceglia, Nicholas Joseph | Advisor(s): Baldi, Pierre F | Abstract: Circadian oscillations play a fundamental role in many biological processes including cell metabolism and cell cycle. As such, interest in understanding these molecular oscillations has generated an increasingly large collection of circadian omic data. These studies have demonstrated the remarkable plasticity with which the set of oscillating molecular species within a cell are selected. These large shifts in oscillating species are known as circadian reprogramming events. These events have been observed across experimental condition, tissue, and species. While many of these studies have made tissue or condition specific conclusions, a consolidated framework of software tools and a central repository of data has become necessary to answer questions about the orchestration of these reprogramming events.", "citation_paragraph": "The frequency at which a TF or RBP is found to oscillate in a collection of datasets provides a simple metric for estimating its consistency in circadian oscillation. show that TFs involved in the circadian core clock are found to be the most frequently oscillating. This purely data-driven approach automatically discovers the circadian core clock. Furthermore, it identifies additional TFs and RBPs that must play an important role in circadian oscillation.Transcript frequency is defined as the total number of datasets where a given protein coding transcript is found to be oscillating at a BIO CYCLE predicted p-value < 0.01. Proteincoding transcripts were identified from BioMart ENSEMBL gene database [55] . of the corresponding protein [52] . We addressed this issue by computing and modeling the distribution of this lag, using transcriptomic and proteomic datasets produced from the same study on CircadiOmics.After filtering on p-value for the first criteria, the remaining two criteria were combined into two different CRC scores. The B-score is a binary indicator of circadian regulation at various filtering thresholds for the number of high quality binding sites and the likelihood of phase correlation. The E-score is an exponentially weighted combination of these two criteria. In general, results generated using both scores tend to agree. However, B-score, as a binary indicator, is more convenient for large scale analysis of graph structures. In contrast, E-score, as a real valued metric, has more sensitivity and is used for ranking nodes and edges. For each source TF or RBP, a CRC score was computed by aggregating all the CRC E-scores from all its outgoing edges either in all experiments or in tissue-specific experiments. The highest scoring TFs and RBPs are shown in Table 3 .3. When looking at aggregated results, core clock TFs such as CLOCK and BMAL1 were found to have the largest scores, a finding consistent with both the frequency of oscillation and previous literature [60] . Extended members of the core clock were also identified in the ranking including THRA and BHLHE40 [56, 32] .In the results across all datasets, additional TFs and RBPs were identified that seem to have a much broader regulatory role than what is reported in the literature. For instance, FUS and CIRBP have been reported to affect the core circadian factor PER2 via alternative splicing, but only in the mouse liver [30, 42, 46] . In contrast, we find that FUS and CIRBP are found to be high scoring also in both brain and skin. EIF4B has been identified in the circadian regulation of translation in mouse liver [23] . We find that EIF4B is also top scoring in skin. HNRPDL is listed as a potential target of circadian regulation via microRNA in the brain [9] . Strikingly, these RBPs and TFs are found to have very high CRC scores across all mouse datasets. This suggest that they play a broader, previously uncharacterized role 21 in circadian regulation.When looking at tissue specific results, many additional TFs and RBPs with high CRC scores are discovered. Although literature evidence has shown that these factors interact with circadian pathways, they are not known to be regulators of oscillation. These TFs may explain tissue specific circadian reprogramming. Within brain tissue, SFPQ is functionally involved in the cell cycle pathway, which also includes NONO and PER2 [17] . EGR1 has been found to oscillate and regulated by the core clock [31] . Within our results, EGR1potentially regulates a large number of downstream transcripts in the brain. CHD1 is known to be involved in circadian chromatin remodeling in brain [5] . KLF15 is well known to be regulated by the peripheral clock in relation to circadian nitrogen homeostatis in liver and muscle [22] . Within skin tissue, RUNX is a top TF and is known to be regulated in a circadian fashion in epidermal cells [21] . E2F1 is regulated by circadian factors SIRT1 and CLOCK [44] . BRCA1 is known to interact with core clock TFs such as PER2 [61] . Within liver tissue, CEBPB is top ranking excluding core clock TFs. This agrees with the literature finding that it interacts with the core clock through REV-ERB [18] . PCBP4 is known to be involved in circadian alternative splicing in the liver [39] .Additionally, there are many other novel findings that have been linked to very few circadian studies. These findings include: NFIC, RAD21, MXI1, and TARDBP across all tissues;ZC3H11A, RBM28, and CEBPG in brain; HCFC1 and ETV5 in skin; and HNRNPK, ATF5, and BACH1/MAFK in liver, and may provide leads for investigations of previously unknown circadian regulatory mechanisms.", "citance": "Within skin tissue, RUNX is a top TF and is known to be regulated in a circadian fashion in epidermal cells [21] .", "claims": [{"text": "RUNX is regulated by circadian rythyms in epidermal cells.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 23902174, "title": "Radiation biology for pediatric radiologists", "abstract": "The biological effects of radiation result primarily from damage to DNA. There are three effects of concern to the radiologist that determine the need for radiation protection and the dose principle of ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable). (1) Heritable effects. These were thought to be most important in the 1950s, but concern has declined in recent years. The current ICRP risk estimate is very small at 0.2%/Sv. (2) Effects on the developing embryo and fetus include weight retardation, congenital anomalies, microcephaly and mental retardation. During the sensitive period of 8 to 15 weeks of gestation, the risk estimate for mental retardation is very high at 40%/Sv, but because it is a deterministic effect, there is likely to be a threshold of about 200 mSv. (3) Carcinogenesis is considered to be the most important consequence of low doses of radiation, with a risk of fatal cancer of about 5%/Sv, and is therefore of most concern in radiology. Our knowledge of radiation carcinogenesis comes principally from the 60-year study of the A-bomb survivors. The use of radiation for diagnostic purposes has increased dramatically in recent years. The annual collective population dose has increased by 750% since 1980 to 930,000 person Sv. One of the principal reasons is the burgeoning use of CT scans. In 2006, more than 60 million CT scans were performed in the U.S., with about 6 million of them in children. As a rule of thumb, an abdominal CT scan in a 1-year-old child results in a life-time mortality risk of about one in a thousand. While the risk to the individual is small and acceptable when the scan is clinically justified, even a small risk when multiplied by an increasingly large number is likely to produce a significant public health concern. It is for this reason that every effort should be made to reduce the doses associated with procedures such as CT scans, particularly in children, in the spirit of ALARA.", "citation_paragraph": "Based on animal experiments, growth retardation is not observed following irradiation during pre-implantation, which is the first 9 days after conception in humans. Temporary growth retardation is seen following irradiation during organogenesis, i.e. the period when organs and limbs are developing. Permanent growth retardation is observed following irradiation during the fetal period. In the human, growth retardation is evident in the 1,613 children who were exposed in utero in Hiroshima. Those exposed within 1,500 m of the hypocenter compared with those more than 3,000 m away grew to be 2.25 cm shorter and 3 kg lighter in weight and to have a head diameter 1.1 cm smaller. The average kerma to which these individuals were exposed was 0.25 Gy.Congenital abnormalities occur as a consequence of irradiation during organogenesis, which in the human is the period from 10 days to 6 weeks of gestation. Figure 6 illustrates the results of an experiment in which mice were exposed to a large radiation dose at various stages of gestation [2] . During pre-implantation, the principal effect of radiation is death of the newly fertilized egg, i.e. prenatal death. As one passes into organogenesis, the form of death changes from prenatal to neonatal and at the same time there is a dramatic increase in the number of abnormalities. Almost every organ or limb can be distorted depending on the day of gestation at which radiation is delivered. In the Japanese survivors of the A-bombs, the principal effects noted are microcephaly and severe mental retardation. This latter effect is clearly seen in a proportion of individuals who were irradiated at 8 to 15 weeks of gestation. This is illustrated in Fig. 7 [3] . These data indicate that the incidence of severe mental retardation as a function of dose is apparently linear without threshold at 8 to 15 weeks, with a risk coefficient of 40% per gray. The incidence is about four times lower if radiation was delivered in the 16-to 25-week period of gestation. The data are also consistent with a threshold of about 0.2 Gy, which is likely to be true since this effect is caused by the killing of cells as they migrate in the brain from the region in which they are produced by division to the region in which they function, i.e. it is a deterministic effect.The data from the Japanese survivors are supported by a study from Sweden of 4,577 boys younger than 18 months who received radiotherapy for hemangioma. This study by Hall et al. [4] reported that there was a significant decrease in the proportion of boys who could pass the examination to enter high school if the dose to the brain exceeded 100 mGy. Furthermore, there was a dose response for loss of cognitive function for doses in the range 20 to 250 mGy. Fig. 7 The frequency of mental retardation as a function of dose among those exposed in utero to atomic-bomb radiation. The data are pooled from Hiroshima and Nagasaki for those exposed at 8 to 15 weeks' gestational age. The vertical bars represent the 90% confidence intervals. There was not risk at 0 to 8 weeks after conception, and for exposure at later periods during gestation (16+ weeks), the excess is barely significant, even at the higher doses (Adapted from 5 Illustration of how the decreasing concern for the importance of heritable effects has been mirrored by an increasing concern for radiation carcinogenesis. In the 1950s, experiments with Drosophila had shown radiation to be a mutagen, while at that time an excess of solid cancers was not evident in the A-bomb survivors. By the 1990s, the importance of radiation carcinogenesis was obvious from the maturing A-bomb data, while concern for heritable effects declined further", "citance": "This study by Hall et al.

The diagnosis was established by clinical assessment in addition to technetium-99m pertechnetate thyroid scan or computed tomography scan of the thyroid and mediastinum. Oral iodine-131 therapy was administered as a 2.22 GBq (60 mCi) cumulative dose over 4 months (555 MBq per month). All patients were monitored with serum thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroxine (\u00b1 free tri-iodothyronine) assays before the treatment and after each dose fraction. Clinical and biochemical follow-up was performed on all patients and ranged from 6 to 45 months after therapy. The patients consisted of 35 female and three male patients with a median age of 59 years (range 37\u201387 years). Prior to treatment 20 patients were biochemically hyperthyroid and 18 were euthyroid. Overall, 71% of patients reported a subjective improvement in compressive symptoms and 29% reported no change. Clinically assessed reduction in goitre size occurred in 92% of patients while there was no change in 8%. At 3 months of follow-up, 31% of patients had become hypothyroid and at 18 months 66% were hypothyroid. Seven hyperthyroid patients (35%) became euthyroid and 13 hyperthyroid patients (65%) became hypothyroid. Three patients who became hypothyroid experienced neck soreness (transient in one patient, persistent in two patients). There were no differences in outcome between patients who were hyperthyroid and those who were euthyroid prior to treatment. Fractionated out-patient radioiodine therapy showed excellent short- and medium-term safety, was very well tolerated and offered a satisfactory alternative treatment to surgery.", "citation_paragraph": "Our results support other data indicating that radioiodine treatment is an effective and safe alternative to surgery in patients who are at operative risk [2, 6, 7, 8] . In addition, our results show that fractionated treatment is a safe and effective way to administer radioiodine to outpatients. This treatment regimen facilitates a conservative approach to therapy by allowing monthly clinical assessment and thyroid function tests to be checked prior to the next scheduled 131 I dose. The low rate of adverse reactions is testimony to the safety of this approach. Less structured multiple 131 I dosing schedules have previously been reported in patients with toxic multinodular goitres but without data describing short-term adverse effects of therapy [9, 10] . It is our experience and the experience of others that a more aggressive approach to therapy, such as a single higher radioiodine dose, may result in a higher likelihood of adverse effects associated with thyroid oedema, particularly in patients with hyperthyroidism and large retrosternal goitre [10] . Only one of the 38 patients failed to show clinical or subjective improvement following treatment. This 42-year-old female patient, who had a background of three debulking thyroid operations and whose major symptom was a sensation of tightness in the throat, had an irregularly shaped retrosternal goitre which showed no reduction in size following radioiodine treatment. All of the remaining patients were considered to have had a satisfactory response to radioiodine treatment characterised by resolution of compressive symptoms, reduction in thyroid size and in many cases improved cosmetic appearance. The patients in our study included eight who had undergone previous hemi-thyroidectomy with recurrence of compressive symptoms requiring further treatment. The recurrence rate following subtotal thyroidectomy has been reported to be between 10% and 20% [11, 12] . Unfortunately, there is a paucity of corresponding data documenting the rate of recurrence of goitre following radioiodine therapy at doses greater than 1 GBq. Our experience, however, indicates that this is a rare occurrence. Surgery may offer a faster and more predictable earlier therapeutic response compared to radioiodine therapy, and is indicated where there exists a suspicion of thyroid carcinoma, but otherwise surgery offers little therapeutic advantage over radioiodine treatment in adult patients. Patients with bulky or retrosternal goitres may be best managed by first-line radioiodine treatment, particularly if the patient is elderly or considered to be at high surgical risk.Radioiodine treatment of non-toxic multinodular goitre has previously been shown to result in a substantial reduction in thyroid volume and, although our data do not include accurate volume measurements, the clinical assessment of our patients indicates that an obvious reduction in thyroid volume occurs in the majority of radioiodine-treated non-toxic and toxic multinodular goitres [13] . Our data show remarkably few differences in outcome between hyperthyroid and euthyroid patients. Similar results have been previously reported in an outcome study of German patients treated with fractionated doses of radioiodine [14] .Following radioiodine treatment, transient or persistent biochemical hyperthyroidism, although recognised in 21 patients, did not have any clinical impact on outcome of management. This response to radioiodine treatment has been described previously [13, 15, 16] . Early reintroduction of antithyroid medications, continued until biochemical euthyroidism was achieved, most likely contributed to the absence of clinical thyrotoxicity all 21 patients. Our practice was, where appropriate, to reintroduce antithyroid medications 3-5 days after treatment at half the pre-radioiodine dose but at the same dose interval. This regimen was very well tolerated and excellent patient compliance was achieved.Other studies have shown lower rates of post-treatment hypothyroidism, ranging from 7% to 30% after 2 years [1, 9, 13] . In other studies, however, where radioiodine doses in excess of 1 GBq were administered, hypothyroidism was observed in 78% of patients after 6 months and 100% of surviving patients after 8 years [7, 17] . Comparison of published studies is often difficult due to variation in radioiodine dosing regimen, geographical differences, racial differences and inability to accurately determine the thyroid volume because of heterogeneous thyroid shape and retrosternal extension [18, 19] . Due to the relatively high rate of post-treatment hypothyroidism, it can be argued that the patients in our series were overtreated with radioiodine. It would appear that a management \"trade-off\" may need to be made where the primary treatment goal is to reduce the size of thyroid tissue in order to reduce symptoms, or even to improve cosmetic appearance. In achieving this goal a higher rate of hypothyroidism may be the consequence. It can also be argued that hypothyroidism and the improvement of symptoms can be regarded as a satisfactory result where the consenting patient is aware of the risks of hypothyroidism prior to treatment. Obviously, it would be ideal to deliver the exactly required dose to the thyroid gland and minimise post-treatment hypothyroidism, but this is difficult to achieve under these clinical circumstances. Our results suggest that for Australian patients with voluminous goitres a treatment threshold of approximately 1.6 GBq exists, beyond which a relatively high rate of hypothyroidism will occur. It is of interest to observe that administration of radioiodine in fractions did not appear to affect the uptake of each subsequent dose in terms of overall outcome. This observation indicates that the dosing interval of 1 month may be sufficient to prevent what has been referred to as \"thyroid stunning\" [20, 21] .", "citance": "Radioiodine treatment of non-toxic multinodular goitre has previously been shown to result in a substantial reduction in thyroid volume and, although our data do not include accurate volume measurements, the clinical assessment of our patients indicates that an obvious reduction in thyroid volume occurs in the majority of radioiodine-treated non-toxic and toxic multinodular goitres [13] .", "claims": [{"text": "Radioiodine treatment of non-toxic multinodular goitre increases thyroid volume.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Radioiodine treatment of non-toxic multinodular goitre reduces thyroid volume.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Radioiodine treatment of toxic multinodular goitre reduces thyroid volume.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Thyroid volume is enlargd after treatment of toxic multinodular goitre with radioiodine.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}
{"s2orc_id": 4036213, "title": "Influence of the AgrC-AgrA complex on the response time of Staphylococcus aureus quorum sensing.", "abstract": "The Staphylococcus aureus agr quorum-sensing system plays a major role in the transition from the persistent to the virulent phenotype. S. aureus agr type I to IV strains are characterized by mutations in the sensor domain of the histidine kinase AgrC and differences in the sequences of the secreted autoinducing peptides (AIP). Here we demonstrate that interactions between the cytosolic domain of AgrC (AgrCCyto) and the response regulator domain of AgrA (AgrARR) dictate the spontaneity of the cellular response to AIP stimuli. The crystal structure of AgrCCyto provided a basis for a mechanistic model of AgrC-AgrA interactions. This model enabled an analysis of the biochemical and biophysical parameters of AgrC-AgrA interactions in the context of the conformational features of the AgrC-AgrA complex. This analysis revealed distinct sequence and conformational features that determine the affinity, specificity, and kinetics of the phosphotransfer reaction. This step, which governs the response time for transcriptional reengineering triggered by an AIP stimulus, is independent of the agr type and similar for agonist and antagonist stimuli. These experimental data could serve as a basis on which to validate simulations of the quorum-sensing response and for strategies that employ the agr quorum-sensing system to combat biofilm formation in S. aureus infections.", "citation_paragraph": "Crystal structure of the cytosolic domain of AgrC. Extensive screening of recombinant protein constructs (see Table SA1 in the supplemental material) with various lengths yielded diffraction quality crystals of AgrC Cyto . The data collection and refinement statistics are compiled in Table 1 . The phase information for this structure was obtained by molecular replacement with the T. maritima sensor kinase (PDB code 2C2A) as a search model (27) . Analysis of the diffraction data and subsequent biochemical analyses of AgrC Cyto crystals suggested that these crystals contained an 18-kDa fragment of AgrC Cyto , perhaps because of in situ proteolysis in the crystallization drop. While we were successful in crystallizing the intact cytosolic domain in the case of another AgrC construct [AgrC ], these crystals diffracted to a lower resolution (see Fig. SA1 and Table SA3 in the supplemental material). Also, the polypeptide stretch corresponding to the dimerization helix and the catalytic histidine residue (His-239) could not be modeled in the experimental maps because of poor electron density. The subsequent structural description is thus restricted to the CA domain of AgrC Cyto . The CA domain (residues 278 to 430) of AgrC Cyto has a sixstranded \u2424-sheet (\u24241 to \u24246) stacked against four helices (\u24231 to \u24234) (Fig. 1A ). This domain is broadly similar to the ATP binding domains of proteins belonging to the GHKL superfamily of ATPases including TM0853 (PDB code 2C2A), PrrB (PDB code 1YS3), DesK (PDB code 3EHG), CheA (PDB code 1I59), and PhoQ (PDB code 1ID0) (28) . However, in the ATP binding domain of AgrC, the \u24241 strand is part of a \u2424-sheet formed with five other \u2424 strands. This differs from other reported structures, wherein the first \u2424 strand of the ATP binding domain forms a linker between the dimerization and ATP binding domains. This \u2424-sheet forms the back wall of the ATP binding cavity. The polypeptide that covers the nucleotide binding pocket, also referred to as the ATP lid, is tethered between two hydrophobic clusters (27) . Sequence and structural comparisons reveal that AgrC has a shorter lid in the ATP binding pocket than other characterized ATP binding domains. In the conformation seen in AgrC Cyto , helices \u24233 and \u24234 are located at the entrance of active site. The positioning of these helices is likely to hinder substrate binding. The orientation of these helices is different from other substrate-bound ATP binding domains (for example, PDB code 2C2A) ( Fig. 1B; see Fig. SA2 in the supplemental material) (27) as well as the apo domain structures (PDB code 1YS3). In this context, it is worth noting that although AgrC Cyto could be crystallized only in the presence of ATP, the experimental maps did not reveal electron density for ATP.Autophosphorylation of AgrC. A time course reaction with AgrC Cyto in the presence of different concentrations of [\u2425-32 P]ATP at 25\u00b0C suggested a first-order reaction for the first 5 min, followed by a saturation phase over the next 20 min (Fig. 2A) . The phosphorylated protein was stable for more than 1 h at 25\u00b0C (Fig.  2B) . At the initial stage, the autophosphorylation reaction is first order in ATP and the dependence of k obs on the ATP concentration was half maximal, at 40 \u03ee 2 M (K ATP ). The overall apparent pseudo-first-order rate of autophosphorylation, K cat (K phos ) is 0.11 \u03ee 0.002 min \u03ea1 , which is similar to that of other histidine kinases, such as S. aureus WalK (13), Streptococcus pneumoniae WalK (29) , Bacillus subtilis NarQ (30), and S. aureus VraS (31) .Phosphotransfer kinetics. Incubation of AgrC Cyto \u03f3P with AgrA revealed a rapid transfer of the phosphoryl group to AgrA (Fig. 2C) ; indeed, 50% of the phosphoryl group was transferred within a minute of the initiation of the reaction. A 3-fold excess of AgrA was maintained in these phosphotransfer experiments. The estimated pseudo-first-order rate constant of the phosphotransfer during the initial period at room temperature is 0.068 \u03ee 0.001s \u03ea1 . The phosphotransfer kinetics support the hypothesis that transmembrane signal transduction is almost instantaneous, involving low affinity, transient AgrC-AgrA interactions. The rapid phosphotransfer is also consistent with a recent study that suggests that rapid phosphotransfer rates can be correlated with histidine kinase response regulator specificity and governs fidelity in twocomponent systems (32, 33) . As hypothesized by the molecular model, these interactions involve only the receiver domain of AgrA. Indeed, the phosphotransfer from AgrC Cyto \u03f3P to a shorter construct of AgrA containing only the receiver domain (AgrA RR ) is similar to that of AgrA FL (Fig. 2D) .AgrC Cyto -AgrA RR interactions. The crystal structure of AgrC Cyto provided a basis for a mechanistic model of the AgrC Cyto -AgrA RR complex. In this model, the arrangement of the AgrC Cyto dimer was modeled on T. maritima HK853 (PDB code 3DGE) (34, 35) (Fig. 3A) . The response regulator was subsequently placed by in silico docking trials with the RosettaDock suite (36) . In this structural arrangement, AgrA RR is stacked on the dimerization helices of AgrC (Fig. 3A) . This model is consistent with both the conformational constraints for phosphotransfer and the observation that the interaction between a shorter construct of AgrC Cyto (containing only the ATP binding domain) with AgrA reduces drastically irrespective of ATP concentrations (data not shown). The molecular model of the complex thus incorporates the finding that both subdomains of AgrC Cyto are required for AgrA interactions and the C-terminal DNA binding domain of AgrA does not directly interact with AgrC Cyto . The discrimination between cognate and noncognate response regulator interactions is governed by the sequence and structural features at the interface between the histidine kinase and response regulator (32, 34) . The AgrCAgrA interface suggested distinct sequence characteristics that dictate the interaction specificity in this complex (see Fig. SA3 and SA4 in the supplemental material). Several hydrophobic residues from AgrC are involved in AgrA interactions. These include Val242, Ile244, Leu245, and Leu248 in the polypeptide stretch that extends beyond Tyr251. The segments of AgrA that interact with AgrC, on the other hand, incorporate polypeptide segments on either side of Asp59. While these are conserved in AgrA types I to IV, substantial variations are seen in other response regulators. The influence of these sequence variations on specificity was experimentally examined with two noncognate response regulators, VraR and LytR (see Fig. SA5 in the supplemental material). The interaction between AgrC and these two response regulators was examined by SPR spectroscopy. Assays to evaluate the phosphotransfer between AgrC and these two noncognate response regulators were also conducted by using the same procedure adopted for the cognate AgrC-AgrA complex. The poor binding affinity and kinetics of phosphotransfer between AgrC and these two response regulators are consistent with the notion that sequence features enforce specificity in AgrC-AgrA interactions.The extent of the interaction interface between AgrC and AgrA in the molecular model was also examined by fluorescence spectroscopy. There are no tryptophan residues in either AgrC or AgrA. The introduction of a tryptophan residue at the AgrC CytoAgrA RR interface thus provided a strategy by which to examine AgrC-AgrA interactions by fluorescence spectroscopy. The catalytic histidine residue (His-239) in AgrC is located in one of the dimerization helices. On the basis of the AgrC Cyto -AgrA RR complex model, Tyr-251, located on the same helix as His-239, was mutated to Trp (see Fig. SA6 in the supplemental material) . The far UV circular dichroism spectrum of the AgrC Cyto Y251W mutant was similar to that of AgrC Cyto (see Fig. SA7 in the supplemental material). We note that introduction of the tryptophan residue near the catalytic histidine did not substantially alter the phosphotransfer kinetics (see Fig. SA8 in the supplemental material) or binding affinity, as estimated by SPR spectroscopy (see Fig.  SA9 in the supplemental material). The fluorescence spectrum of the AgrC Cyto Y251W mutant protein showed an emission maximum at 344 nm (Fig. 3D) . A titration involving various concentrations of AgrA FL (0 to 80 M) against 4 M AgrC Cyto Y251W was performed. Fluorescence emission was monitored at 344 nm. Fluorescence intensity saturation could be achieved by the addition of 60 M AgrA FL (Fig. 3E) . The K d for the AgrC Cyto Y251W-AgrA FL interaction was estimated to be 20.62 \u03ee 2.98 M, and that in the For this representation of sequence conservation on a structural model, the transmembrane segment of AgrC (residues 1 to 206) was modeled by using Acetabularia acetabulum rhodopsin AR2 (PDB code 3AM6) as a template in the LOMETS program (51) . Mutations in the seventh transmembrane helix (inset) result in loss of specificity to self-activating peptides (3). The dimerization domain (residues 206 to 278) was modeled on the basis of T. maritima HK853 (PDB code 3DGE) by using the Phyre server (56) . This figure was generated with ConSurf (52).presence of 2 mM ATP was estimated to be 9.02 \u03ee 2.0 M. While these interaction parameters also suggest that ATP influences AgrC-AgrA interactions, the differences between the binding affinities derived by fluorescence spectroscopy with the SPR spectroscopy-derived parameters are likely due to differences in buffer composition.Influence of ATP on AgrC Cyto -AgrA RR interactions. SPR spectroscopy experiments were performed to evaluate the interaction between AgrC Cyto and AgrA (both AgrA FL and AgrA RR ) with and without ATP. Phosphorylation governs AgrC-AgrA interactions. We note that the interaction between AgrC Cyto and AgrA FL In vitro phosphorylation of the response regulator by acetyl phosphate has proven to be immensely useful in dissecting the signal transduction mechanism in bacterial two-component systems. Indeed, acetyl phosphate-induced phosphorylation of AgrA revealed that phosphorylation influences the promoter specificity of AgrA (37) . In this study, we noted that phosphorylation changes the oligomeric association of AgrA. The elution profile of AgrA FL in the presence of 10 mM acetyl phosphate revealed that most of the monomeric species were converted into the dimeric form. The mass spectrometric data on the eluted protein also suggest that 10 mM acetyl phosphate is sufficient to phosphorylate AgrA (see Fig. SA13 in the supplemental material). This finding of phosphorylation-induced dimerization was also confirmed by DLS experiments (Fig. 4) . Transcriptional and phenotypic responses to AIP stimuli. The correlation between the expression of genes in the AgrA regulon and the cellular levels of AgrA was examined. This formed the basis for the evaluation of changes in the expression of genes in the agr regulon in different S. aureus agr types in the presence of agonist and antagonist AIPs. qRT-PCR for selected genes in the agr regulon was performed at different phases of S. aureus growth. The S. aureus growth curve suggests that the time points of 3, 5, and 7 h correspond to the early exponential, exponential, and postexponential phases of S. aureus growth (1). RNA was isolated at these time points, and 1 g of RNA was converted to cDNA for quantitative PCR analysis. The expression of these genes differed among the four clinical isolates. However, in all of the cases, we noted that agrA expression was induced by 3 h and peaked thereafter. This pattern of induction was strongly correlated with the expression of agrC and less so with agrB (data not shown). The expression of agrD also followed a similar profile, where the level decreased by 7 h (Fig. 5A) .The protein levels of AgrA from S. aureus cell lysates was esti- Fig. 5A ) and decreased thereafter in all of the clinical strains examined in this study (see Fig. SA14 in the supplemental material). This finding suggests that degradation of AgrA is not likely to influence the amplification step of the quorum-sensing response. The levels of exotoxins and surface binding proteins could also be correlated with the expression level of agrA. We noted that RNAIII (\u2426-hemolysin) levels were induced by 3 h and increased rapidly thereafter (Fig. 5A ). The expression level was highest at 5 h in all of the strains and increased further in strains 559 (agr type I), 368 (agr type IV), and 1039 (agr type III). The \u2423-hemolysin (hla) levels in strain 1437 were low compared with those of RNAIII, a finding that is consistent with the observations on S. aureus 772 (38) (Fig. 5A ). The expression of surface binding proteins like protein A (spa) is also consistent with earlier reports that spa levels were inversely correlated with the expression of genes in the agr operon (Fig. 5A) (39) . These observations were also examined by using an agr null strain (RN6911). A comparison of the expression levels of RNAIII and spa in agr type I (559) and agr null (RN6911) strains revealed that AgrA dominates RNAIII expression and thereby Hla levels, whereas spa levels remain unaffected (see Fig. SA15 in the supplemental material). In the case of AIP-induced inhibition, we note that the expression of all of the genes examined was downregulated in a similar time frame (less than 2 h) by antagonistic AIP stimuli ( Fig. 5B ; see Fig.  SA16 in the supplemental material). Put together, the expression analysis results revealed that temporal fidelity in AIP-induced transcriptional responses is independent of the S. aureus agr type. Furthermore, AgrA degradation does not appear to influence intracellular signal transduction. Hemolysin assays were performed to examine the time taken for secreted toxins to manifest a virulence phenotype upon AIP induction. All four S. aureus agr types were streaked onto 5% blood agar plates overlaid with concentrated culture supernatants. The effect of secreted exotoxins (\u2423-, \u2424-, and \u2426-hemolysins) could be visualized by a clear zone around the streak. While the zone of inhibition is clearly visible at the 10-h time point in the control assays, AIP induction (antagonist stimulus) causes a delay of 3 to 5 h in this process ( Fig. 5C ; see Fig. SA17 in the supplemental material). This finding is consistent with qRT-PCR data that suggest that hemolysin levels are highest at the 7-h time point. This assay suggests that cross inhibition caused by antagonist AIPs involves a similar time frame for different AIPs (corresponding to different agr types).", "citance": "The rapid phosphotransfer is also consistent with a recent study that suggests that rapid phosphotransfer rates can be correlated with histidine kinase response regulator specificity and governs fidelity in twocomponent systems (32, 33) .", "claims": [{"text": "Rapid phosphotransfer rates are correlated with histidine kinase regulator specificity.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Rapid phosphotransfer rates govern fidelity in two component systems", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Viral infections by coxsackieviruses (CVB) may contribute to trigger autoimmunity in T1D. Cellular permissiveness to viral infection is modulated by innate antiviral responses, which vary among different cell types. We presently describe that global gene expression is similar in cytokine-treated and virus-infected human islet cells, with up-regulation of gene networks involved in cell autonomous immune responses. Comparison between the responses of rat pancreatic \u03b1 and \u03b2 cells to infection by CVB5 and 4 indicate that \u03b1 cells trigger a more efficient antiviral response than \u03b2 cells, including higher basal and induced expression of STAT1-regulated genes, and are thus better able to clear viral infections than \u03b2 cells. These differences may explain why pancreatic \u03b2 cells, but not \u03b1 cells, are targeted by an autoimmune response during T1D.", "citation_paragraph": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease in which pancreatic \u03b2 cells are targeted by a protracted attack by the immune system. This leads to death of most of the \u03b2 cells while neighboring \u03b1 cells survive. The disease is characterized by pancreatic islet inflammation (insulitis) and progressive \u03b2 cell loss by apoptosis (Ziegler and Nepom, 2010; . The triggering of T1D probably depends on environmental factors that interact with predisposing genes to induce autoimmunity against the \u03b2 cells Santin and Eizirik, 2013; . Among the potential environmental factors, epidemiological, clinical, and pathological studies in humans support the implication of viral infections, particularly enteroviruses (e.g., coxsackievirus; CVB), as triggers for the development of T1D (Helfand et al., 1995; Dotta et al., 2007; Yeung et al., 2011; Richardson et al., 2014) . CVB-specific antibodies and enteroviral RNA are more frequently observed in serum samples from T1D patients than in healthy individuals (Helfand et al., 1995; Lonnrot et al., 2000) , and staining of human pancreatic islets revealed that the enteroviral capsid protein VP1 is present at a higher frequency in insulin-containing islets from patients with recent-onset T1D when compared to healthy controls (Dotta et al., 2007; Richardson et al., 2013) . A metaanalysis of 33 prevalence studies involving 1931 T1D cases and 2517 controls confirmed a clinically significant association between enteroviral infections and islet autoimmunity and T1D in humans (Yeung et al., 2011) . Additionally, it has been shown that the presence of enterovirus RNA (Oikarinen et al., 2011) or antibodies anti-CVB1 (Laitinen et al., 2014) in blood can predict the development of T1D.Insulitis is established and exacerbated in the context of a 'dialog' between pancreatic \u03b2 cells and the immune system, regulated by the local production and release of chemokines and cytokines. These proteins attract and stimulate cells of the immune system, such as macrophages and cytotoxic T lymphocytes Willcox et al., 2009; Arif et al., 2014) . The immune cells cause selective \u03b2 cell destruction both directly and via the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), type II interferon (IFN\u03b3), and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1. These cytokines are released closely to the target cells and modulate the expression of complex gene networks in \u03b2 cells, leading to the release of chemokines and eventually to the activation of the intrinsic pathway of cell death in \u03b2 cells Gurzov and Eizirik, 2011) . A key unanswered question in the field is why highly differentiated and specialized pancreatic \u03b2 cells express these immune-related pathways.Host defense in vertebrates is usually viewed as the task of specialized immune cells. This perception underestimates the capacity of many non-immune cells to trigger 'self-defense' or 'cell autonomous immune responses' against infection. These mechanisms are pre-existing in many cell types and can be up-regulated upon virus infection (Yan and Chen, 2012; Randow et al., 2013) . This is an ancient form of cellular protection, present both in bacteria and metazoans. In vertebrates, for instance, cellular self-defense synergizes with innate and adaptive immunity to fight infections (Randow et al., 2013) . The cell susceptibility/resistance of highly differentiated and poorly proliferating cells, such as neurons and pancreatic \u03b2 cells, to microbial infection is a major determinant of clinical outcome.eLife digest Type 1 diabetes is caused by a person's immune system attacking the cells in their pancreas that produce insulin. This eventually kills off so many of these cells-known as beta cells-that the pancreas is unable to make enough insulin. As a result, individuals with type 1 diabetes must inject insulin to help their bodies process sugars. One of the mysteries of type 1 diabetes is why the beta cells in the pancreas are killed by the immune system while neighboring alpha cells, which produce the hormone glucagon, are spared.Scientists suspect a combination of genetic and environmental factors contributes to type 1 diabetes. Certain viruses, including one called Coxsackievirus, appear to trigger type 1 diabetes in susceptible individuals. Other factors may also make these individuals more likely to develop the disease. For example, they may 'express' genes that are thought to increase the risk of type 1 diabetes, many of which control how the immune system responds to viral infections. These genes may make susceptible individuals experience excessive inflammation, because inflammation is what ultimately kills off the beta cells. Now, Marroqui, Lopes, dos Santos et al. provide evidence that suggests why the alpha cells are spared the immune onslaught in type 1 diabetes. In initial experiments, clusters of cells-known as islets-from the human pancreas were either exposed to small proteins that cause inflammation or infected with the Coxsakievirus. Both events caused a similar increase in the expression of particular immune response genes in the islets. This indicates that these islet cells are able to react to the virus and trigger a first line of defense, which will be further boosted when the immune system is subsequently called into action.Islets contain both alpha and beta cells, and so further experiments on alpha and beta cells from rats investigated whether the two cell types respond differently when infected by the Coxsakievirus. The results revealed that alpha cells boost the expression of the genes needed to clear the virus to a greater extent than the beta cells, and so respond more efficiently to the virus. Therefore, an infection is more likely to establish itself in the beta cells and consequently trigger inflammation and the immune system's attack on the cells.These observations explain one of the puzzling questions in the diabetes field and reinforce the possibility that a long-standing viral infection in beta cells-which seem to have a limited capacity to clear viral infections-may be one of the mechanisms leading to progressive beta cell destruction in type 1 diabetes. This knowledge will help in the search for ways to protect beta cells against both viral infections and the consequent immune assault.It has been shown that cerebellum granule cell neurons and cortical neurons (CNs) have unique self-defense programs that confer differential resistance to infection by West Nile virus. Specifically, higher basal expression and faster up-regulation of IFN-induced genes improves the survival of granule cell neurons infected by West Nile virus (Cho et al., 2013) . These responses rely on detection of microbial signatures by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (Randow et al., 2013) . Several candidate genes for T1D expressed in human islets, such as the RIG-like receptor MDA5 and the regulators of type I IFNs PTPN2 and USP18 (Moore et al., 2009; Colli et al., 2010; Santin et al., 2012) , modulate viral detection, antiviral activity, and innate immunity. The candidate genes described above (Moore et al., 2009; Colli et al., 2010; Santin et al., 2012) and CVB5 infection regulate \u03b2 cell apoptosis via activation of the BH3-only protein Bim. These observations support the concept that genetically modulated self-defense responses in \u03b2 cells might play an important role in determining the outbreak of insulitis and the progression to T1D in face of viral infection or other stimuli (Santin and Eizirik, 2013) .Against this background, we have presently evaluated the global gene expression of cytokine-treated and virus-infected human islet cells, observing that these two treatments lead to similar up-regulation of a large number of genes, gene networks, and transcription factors involved in cell autonomous immune responses. This conclusion generated two additional questions, namely whether this self-defense response is islet cell specific and, if yes, whether these putative cellular differences may explain the preferential \u03b2 cell targeting by the autoimmune assault. To answer these questions, we next compared the responses of FACS-purified rat pancreatic \u03b1 and \u03b2 cells to infection by potentially diabetogenic CVB5 and CVB4. The results obtained indicate that \u03b1 cells trigger a more effective antiviral response than \u03b2 cells, including higher basal and induced expression of STAT1-regulated genes, and are thus able to better clear viral infections as compared to \u03b2 cells.", "citance": "Specifically, higher basal expression and faster up-regulation of IFN-induced genes improves the survival of granule cell neurons infected by West Nile virus (Cho et al., 2013) .", "claims": [{"text": "Rapid up-regulation and higher basal expression of interferon-induced genes increase survival of granule cell neurons that are infected by West Nile virus.

Their dynamic interactions in three dimensions within the nucleus regulate gene transcription by changing the chromatin architecture. Such spatial genomic organization is functionally important for the spatial disposition of chromosomes to control cell fate during development and differentiation. Thus, the dysregulation of proper long-range chromatin interactions may influence the development of tumorigenesis and cancer progression.", "citation_paragraph": "Apart from its major function in sister chromatid cohesion, it has recently been shown that cohesin acts in concert with CTCF to affect higher-order chromosome architecture by forming long-range chromosomal interactions in many developmentally regulated gene families [76] . For example, cohesin has been shown to play a critical role in maintaining CTCF-mediated higher-order chromatin conformation at the \u03b2-globin and Igf2/H19 loci [37, 39, 41, 74] . CTCF and cohesin also stabilize the rearrangement of Igh and T-cell receptor loci via long-range chromatin interactions [41, 77, 78] .Although it is not yet clear how CTCF/cohesin mediate chromatin looping, CTCF may first bind between two CTCF sites and form a complex with cohesin through its C-terminal region [60, 79, 80] . Considering the evidence that cohesin can tether DNA molecules together [81] , a study appeared to show that cohesin stabilized long-range chromatin interactions by anchoring DNA strands together within a closed ring structure among CTCF/cohesin localization sites [11, 64, 76] . Interestingly, CTCF/cohesin-mediated chromatin looping preferentially occurs between CTCF sites with www.genominfo.org convergent CTCF DNA motifs [82] . Thus, inverting one site of convergent CTCF-binding sites changes the chromatin architecture and can alter gene expression [5, 83] .CTCF/cohesin-mediated abnormal higher-order chromosome structure during tumor development Dysregulation of the components of the cohesin complex might promote genomic instability by perturbing proper long-range chromatin interactions, which can confer the spatial proximity required for the rejoining of DSBs during chromosomal rearrangement [18] . More recent studies support a similar role for the CTCF/cohesin-mediated chromatin loop as a regulator of genome integrity [84] . They found that chromosome loop anchors bound by CTCF and cohesin are vulnerable to continuous DNA breaks and translocation breakpoint regions in various cancers are enriched at these loop anchors [84] . Similarly, we found that cohesin-mediated chromatin organization and DNA replication are important for stabilizing gene amplification in cancer cells with chromosomal instability (Fig. 5 ) [85] . Although a high frequency of recurrent mutations and deletions of the components of the cohesin complex was identified in human diseases [70, 71, 86] , aberrant overexpression of the cohesin complex [9] was also frequently detected in various human malignancies [85] . Interestingly, we found that overexpression of the cohesin complex in mesenchymal cancer cells induces mesenchymal to epithelial transition-specific expression patterns and dynamic cohesin-mediated chromatin structures are responsible for the initiation and regulation of essential epithelial to mesenchymal transition-related cell fate changes in human cancer (Fig. 6) [87] .An increasing amount of recent evidence has indicated that CTCF and cohesin are enriched at TADs [6, 15] . Accordingly, cohesin-associated CTCF loops occur within TADs and enhancers generally interact with genes within these loops [8] . Interestingly, recurrent mutations occur frequently within CTCF anchor sites adjacent to oncogenes or cancerassociated genes [55] . Mutation in the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gene promotes susceptibility of the CTCF-binding sites to DNA methylation and the loss of CTCF binding resulting in the disruption of TAD organization in human gliomas [88] . Somatic mutations change oncogene-containing insulated neighborhoods, thereby allowing improper activation of proto-oncogenes by enhancers located within different TADs [89] . Furthermore, disruption of CTCF-mediated TAD formation by human noncoding disease variants elicits pathogenic phenotypes, providing the mechanistic linkage between spatial genomic organization and genetic alterations that influence gene expression [90] .", "citance": "Interestingly, recurrent mutations occur frequently within CTCF anchor sites adjacent to oncogenes or cancerassociated genes [55] .", "claims": [{"text": "Recurrent mutations occur frequently within CTCF anchor sites adjacent to oncogenes.", "subject": "mutations", "is_negation": false}]}

We found here that Treg cell progenitors had high expression of the TNFRSF members GITR, OX40 and TNFR2. Expression of those receptors correlated directly with the signal strength of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) and required the coreceptor CD28 and the kinase TAK1. The neutralization of ligands that are members of the TNF superfamily (TNFSF) diminished the development of Treg cells. Conversely, TNFRSF agonists enhanced the differentiation of Treg cell progenitors by augmenting responsiveness of the interleukin 2 receptor (IL-2R) and transcription factor STAT5. Costimulation with the ligand of GITR elicited dose-dependent enrichment for cells of lower TCR affinity in the Treg cell repertoire. In vivo, combined inhibition of GITR, OX40 and TNFR2 abrogated the development of Treg cells. Thus, expression of members of the TNFRSF on Treg cell progenitors translated strong TCR signals into molecular parameters that specifically promoted the development of Treg cells and shaped the Treg cell repertoire.", "citation_paragraph": "The development of T lymphocytes with randomly generated T cell receptors (TCRs) allows for diverse and productive immune responses, but also raises the risk for autoimmunity. The thymic medulla contains antigen presenting cells (APCs) that display self-peptide:major histocompatibility (MHC) complexes to immature CD4 and CD8 single positive (SP) thymocytes, and plays a critical role in limiting autoimmunity 1 . This occurs in part by deletion of a substantial fraction of autoreactive thymocytes via the process of negative selection. However, some autoreactive T cells escape deletion in the thymus, and thus alternative mechanisms to control autoreactivity have evolved including the production of thymic-derived regulatory T cells (T reg ) 2 . The transcription factor Foxp3 plays a critical role in this process as inactivating mutations in Foxp3 abrogate T reg development and cause lethal multi-organ lymphoproliferative disease 3, 4 . More subtle perturbations in T reg development and/or function, such as reduced responsiveness to interleukin-2 (IL-2), are also associated with autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 Diabetes [5] [6] [7] . T reg development occurs via a multistep differentiation process that preferentially drives high affinity autoreactive T cells to express Foxp3. A key question is how thymocytes translate relative differences in TCR signal strength into distinct developmental programs that give rise to na\u00efve CD4 + T cells or regulatory T cells, respectively.Thymic T reg development occurs via a two-step process 8, 9 . An initial TCR-CD28-driven signaling event leads to expression of CD25 and CD122 (the \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits of the IL-2 receptor) and c-REL-dependent chromatin remodeling at the Foxp3 locus [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . A second, TCR-independent but cytokine-dependent step occurs when CD25 + Foxp3 \u2212 T reg progenitors receive an IL-2 signal, which via a STAT5-dependent process drives Foxp3 expression to complete the Treg differentiation process 8, 9, 16 .How high affinity TCR stimuli drive a molecular program that results in T reg differentiation remains poorly defined. A hallmark of T reg progenitor cells that might play a role in this process is their high expression of the TNFRSF member TNFRSF18, (called GITR hereafter). As GITR expression precedes the induction of Foxp3 in developing T reg cells, we hypothesized that costimulation via GITR may support conversion of T reg progenitors into mature Foxp3 + T reg cells in the thymus.In addition to GITR, several other TNFRSF members are expressed on T reg cells 17 . We screened thymocytes by flow cytometry and found that GITR, TNFRSF4 (called OX40 herafter), and TNFRSF1B (called TNFR2 hereafter) are uniquely overexpressed on T reg progenitors when compared to conventional CD4SP thymocytes. Multiple APCs including dendritic cell subsets and medullary thymic epithelial cells express the corresponding ligands GITR-L, OX40-L, and TNF. We found that TNFRSF expression by T reg progenitors strongly correlates with TCR signal strength. Thus, CD4SP thymocytes encountering the highest affinity TCR signals most strongly upregulate GITR, OX40 and TNFR2. This process occurred via a TAK1-and CD28-dependent pathway as TAK1-and CD28-deficient T reg progenitors fail to express GITR, OX40, and TNFR2 and do not convert into mature Foxp3 + T reg cells. Stimulation of wild type T reg progenitors with either GITR-L or OX40-L promoted their conversion into mature Foxp3 + T reg cells at much lower doses of IL-2. In contrast, the addition of neutralizing antibodies to TNFSF members in neonatal thymic organ cultures markedly inhibited T reg development. Likewise, blocking signaling collectively through OX40, TNFR2 and GITR completely abrogated T reg development in vivo indicating that GITR, OX40 and TNFR2 function in a cell-intrinsic manner to program T reg differentiation. Finally, competition for TNFRSF costimulation skews the T reg repertoire toward higher affinity TCRs, as increasing GITR-L availability dose-dependently broadens the T reg repertoire by enriching for cells with reduced TCR signal strength. These findings support a model in which high-affinity TCR signals in CD4SP thymocytes are translated into a molecular program that entrains T reg development via increased expression of specific TNFRSF members. Ligation of GITR, OX40 or TNFR2 on T reg progenitors enhances the ability of T reg progenitors to compete for limiting amounts of IL-2 and thereby helps define the developmental niche for T reg cells in the thymus.", "citance": "More subtle perturbations in T reg development and/or function, such as reduced responsiveness to interleukin-2 (IL-2), are also associated with autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 Diabetes [5] [6] [7] .", "claims": [{"text": "Reduced responsiveness to interleukin-2 in regulatory T cells is associated with autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 Diabetes.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Reduced responsiveness to interleukin-2 in regulatory T cells is associated with greater resistance to autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 Diabetes.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Type 1 Diabetes is associated with subtle perturbations in T reg development.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Much efforts have been made to unravel the epigenetic mechanisms underlying the cell fate conversion. Histone modifications as the major epigenetic regulator are implicated in various aspects of reprogramming and transdifferentiation. Here, we discuss the roles of histone modifications on reprogramming and transdifferentiation and hopefully provide new insights into induction and promotion of the cell fate conversion by modulating histone modifications.", "citation_paragraph": "Genetically manipulating histone-modifying enzymes is often global and irreversible, so changing them locally or temporarily is better and safer. Small chemical compounds are available to inhibit or activate histone-modifying enzymes. These small molecules have advantages over the genetic manipulation, because they are cell permeable, nonimmunogenic, more cost-effective, and more easily synthesized, preserved, and standardized. More importantly, they inhibit and activate the enzyme activity reversibly and finely only by varying the time and concentrations [46] . Many small molecules are used to induce and improve reprogramming [46, 47] (Table 2) .Reducing the repressive histone modifications by small molecules can enhance reprogramming considerably. Vitamin C treatment enhances the reprogramming of murine and human fibroblasts to pluripotency [48] , partly because it can increase the expression of several H3K9 demethylases, which then demethylate H3K9me2/3 and shift the heterochromatic state surrounding pluripotency genes to euchromatic state [40, 49] . 3-deazaneplanocin A (DNZep), an S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) hydrolase inhibitor, can reduce the H3K9me3 deposition at the Oct4 promoter and enhance reprogramming [50] . Chemical drug CYT296, when added to reprogramming medium, disrupts compact chromatins and reduces heterochromatin protein 1alpha (HP1alpha) and H3K9me3, increasing the OSKM-and Oct4-mediated reprogramming [51] . BIX-01294, known as a specific inhibitor of H3K9me3 methyltransferase G9a, is used to speed up the OK (Oct4 and Klf4)-mediated reprogramming of the mouse embryonic fibroblasts [35] and neural progenitor cells (NPC) [52] into iPSCs or the SCNTmedicated reprogramming [53] . Small molecules can also change other repressive histone marks. Vitamin C treatment decreases H3K27me3 at promoter regions of pluripotency genes such as Zfp42 (ZFP42 zinc finger protein), Ddx4 (DEAD-box helicase 4), and Nanog during the transition of pre-iPSCs to iPSCs [54] . Because H3K79 methylation inhibits reprogramming, decreasing H3K79 methylation with EPZ 004777, an inhibitor of H3K79 histone methyltransferase Dot1l, improves the reprogramming rate [31, 55] .As active histone marks favor gene activation, enhancing the active H3K4 methylation by small molecules facilitates reprogramming. Hochedlinger and colleagues found that vitamin C treatment induces a full reprogramming of Blymphocytes into iPSCs that can generate entirely iPSCderived mice (Ball iPSC-derived mice^), which is not observed without vitamin C treatment. Why can vitamin C improve the reprogramming quality? The imprinted Dlk-Dio3 locus is lost in the majority of iPSC lines, whose loss impairs the potential of iPSCs to generate all iPSC-derived mice. Vitamin C, however, can preserve the imprinted Dlk-Dio3 locus by maintaining H3K4me2 and regaining H3K4me3 on the promoter [56] . Likewise, maintaining the methylated H3K4 by an H3K4 demethylase inhibitor, parnate, boosts OSK-or Oct4-mediated iPSC generation from fibroblasts [36] , or OK-mediated iPSC generation from keratinocytes [57] . Interestingly, reducing H3K4me3 methylation by inhibiting the histone H3K4 methyltransferase MLL1 activity with small-molecule inhibitor MM-401 induces mouse epiblast stem cells to na\u00efve pluripotency efficiently [58] . In the case, blocking MLL1 redistributes globally the repressive H3K4 monomethylation (H3K4me1) at enhancers of lineage determinant factors and markers of epiblast stem cells, subsequently repressing their expression.Although H3K36 di\u2212/tri-methylation (H3K36me2/3) marks are usually transcriptional active, inhibiting H3K36me2/3 by vitamin C increases iPSC production [59] . Vitamin C upregulates the levels of the H3K36 demethylases Jhdm1a/ 1b, which then reduce H3K36me2/3. Specifically, Jhdm1b removes active H3K36me2/3 marks from the Ink4/Arf locus required for cell senescence, therefore, repressing the Ink4/Arfmediated cell senescence and promoting fibroblast proliferation during reprogramming [59] . This study indicates that removing active histone marks from genes inhibiting reprogramming promotes reprogramming potently.Histone acetylation generally correlates with gene activation. Increasing the level of histone acetylation by HDAC inhibitors seems to enhance reprogramming. Valproic acid (VPA), an HDAC inhibitor, enables efficient reprogramming of fibroblasts in the absence of c-Myc [60] or both c-Myc and Klf4 [34] . Sodium butyrate (NaB), a naturally occurring fatty acid, is an HDAC inhibitor; when added into the induction medium, it increases the generation of iPSCs [61] . Other HDAC inhibitors such as trichostatin A (TSA) and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), display similar promoting effects [60] [61] [62] . Pandian and colleagues developed a small-molecule SAHA-PIP comprising of SAHA and the sequence-specific DNA binding pyrrole-imidazole polyamides (PIP) and found this molecule able to induce genome-wide epigenetic reprogramming and to activate Oct-3/4 regulated pluripotency genes in human fibroblasts [63] . RSC133, a new synthetic derivative of indoleacrylic acid/indolepropionic acid, can dually inhibit histone deacetylase and DNA methyltransferase; when administered, it can remarkably accelerate the reprogramming to pluripotency [64] .", "citance": "Interestingly, reducing H3K4me3 methylation by inhibiting the histone H3K4 methyltransferase MLL1 activity with small-molecule inhibitor MM-401 induces mouse epiblast stem cells to na\u00efve pluripotency efficiently [58] .", "claims": [{"text": "Reducing H3k4me3 methylation induces mouse epiblast stem cells to naive pluripotency efficiently.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

However, several human congenital diseases have been found to be associated with mutations in ribosome biogenesis factors. Surprisingly, despite the global requirement for ribosomes, these \"ribosomopathies\" are characterized by distinct and tissue specific phenotypes. The reasons for such tissue proclivity in ribosomopathies remain mysterious but may include differential expression of ribosome biogenesis factors in distinct tissues.   METHODS Here we use in situ hybridization of labeled antisense mRNA probes and ultra high temporal resolution RNA-Seq data to examine and compare expression of 13 disease associated ribosome biogenesis factors at six key stages in Xenopus tropicalis development.   RESULTS Rather than being ubiquitously expressed during development, mRNAs of all examined ribosome biogenesis factors were highly enriched in specific tissues, including the cranial neural crest and ventral blood islands. Interestingly, expression of ribosome biogenesis factors demonstrates clear differences in timing, transcript number and tissue localization.   CONCLUSION Ribosome biogenesis factor expression is more spatiotemporally regulated during embryonic development than previously expected and correlates closely with many of the common ribosomopathy phenotypes. Our findings provide information on the dynamic use of ribosome production machinery components during development and advance our understanding of their roles in disease.", "citation_paragraph": "Ribosomes translate genetically encoded information into proteins. Their production is a ubiquitous, carefully regulated, and energetically expensive cellular process. It is so essential to life that it alone accounts for over 60 % of total transcription in eukaryotic cells [1, 2] . While it was long assumed that any defect in this fundamental process would be incompatible with life, mutations affecting ribosome production have now been identified in several human congenital disorders (ribosomopathies) and in animal models [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Despite all arising from abnormalities in the ubiquitous process of ribosome biogenesis, these diseases exhibit unexpectedly unique phenotypes (Table 1) [1, [16] [17] [18] . The reason for this tissue proclivity remains mysterious but its existence hints at a fundamental cell type specificity in ribosome biology during development.Ribosome production is a complex process. Briefly summarized, each 80S ribosome is composed of two ribonucleoprotein subcomplexes. The large 60s subunit (LSU) is composed of the 28S, 5.8S and 5S ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and 46 associated ribosomal proteins (RPL), while the small 40S subunit (SSU) contains the 18S rRNA and 33 ribosomal proteins (RPS, Fig. 1a ) [1, 18] . Production of these subunits begins in the nucleolus with the transcription of the polycistronic pre-ribosomal RNA (rRNA) by RNA polymerase I (RNAPI). This large precursor rRNA then undergoes numerous sequential cleavages, modifications and foldings to ultimately produce the mature 18S rRNA, 5.8S and 28S rRNAs. The 5S rRNA is transcribed separately by RNA polymerase III (Fig. 1a) . Correct transcription and processing of the rRNAs and their assembly into the ribosomal subcomplexes requires the concerted action of all three RNA polymerases, 75 small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), and over 200 ribosome biogenesis factors [1, 16, [19] [20] [21] . Each of these biogenesis factors must also be transcribed by RNA polymerase II, translated by cytoplasmic ribosomes and localized correctly to carry out its function in the nucleolus, nucleus or cytoplasm (Fig. 1a) [1, 16, 18] .A number of human diseases are now associated with defects in ribosome production (Table 1) . For example, lesions in at least 15 different ribosomal proteins (RP) underlie Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA, OMIM# 105650, RPL and RPS mutations) [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . These anomalies affect pre-rRNA processing and assembly of the SSU or LSU, and typically result in bone marrow failure. Craniofacial, growth and limb defects are also commonly present in patients [16, 22, 25] . Mutations in the ribosome biogenesis factor hUTP4 (formerly called Cirhin), cause North American Indian Childhood Cirrhosis (NAIC, OMIM# 604901, UTP4 mutations), a form of biliary cirrhosis [32, 33] . Without a liver transplant in childhood, this condition is fatal. In ShwachmanBodian-Diamond syndrome (SBDS, OMIM# 260400), patients present with pancreatic failure, bone marrow defects and skeletal abnormalities caused by mutations in the SBDS protein that impair maturation of the large ribosomal subunit [34] [35] [36] . Treacher-Collins syndrome (TCS, OMIM# 154500, typically TCOF1 mutations) is characterized primarily by craniofacial defects [1, 3, 5, 16, 18, [37] [38] [39] . Other major ribosomopathies include Chromosome 5q-syndrome (5q, OMIM# 153550, acquired RPS14 mutations, macrocytic anemia) [1, 16, 40] , Alopecia, Neurological and Endocrinopathy syndrome (ANE, OMIM# 612079, RBM28 mutations) [41] , and isolated congenital asplenia (ICA, OMIM# 271400, RPSA mutations), that specifically impairs spleen development [42] . Numerous additional confirmed and suspected ribosomopathies exist (Table 1) . While some of the ribosomopathies have defects in common (e.g. anemia, growth retardation, craniofacial defects, increased risk of cancer), these diseases are clinically distinct and difficult to treat. Understanding their etiology is a first step towards improving treatment options and patient prognosis.Why defects in the ubiquitous production of ribosomes lead to tissue specific phenotypes remains a fascinating and clinically important question. One possibility is that the affected tissues are simply rapidly dividing and are thus more sensitive to reduced ribosome numbers. However, this does not account for the non-overlapping phenotypes observed in these syndromes, or explain why some highly active populations appear unaffected. Other proposed mechanisms include 1) selective translation of mRNAs with internal ribosome entry sites and 2) extra ribosomal functions specific to each protein [16, [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] . One intriguing possibility that may explain the diverse effects of ribosomal protein abnormality is that ribosomes are tailored to translate specific mRNAs, or have particular properties in different cell types. Changes in ribosomal composition and biogenesis may then affect these activities. In support, reduction of Rpl38 in mice can alter the composition of Hox gene mRNAs translation and embryonic patterning, without reducing overall protein synthesis [6] . Furthermore, ribosomal gene mRNA expression exhibits significant variation across tissues [6, 46, 47, [49] [50] [51] . Such variation may result in differential ribosome production and activity. This idea of specialized ribosomes challenges our notion of ribosomes as monolithic entities and may suggest a fundamental mechanism of translational regulation. However, a comprehensive spatiotemporal understanding of ribosomopathy associated gene expression during development is not known, which is essential to correlate with the tissue proclivity observed in ribosomopathies.As a preliminary step in examining this issue, we analyzed the expression of thirteen distinct ribosome biogenesis factors (rps7, 14, 17, 19, 29, rpl15, 26, 35a, 38, tcof1, rbm28, sbds and utp4) using whole mount in situ hybridization and ultra high temporal resolution RNASeq data. Mutations in twelve of these factors are implicated in six phenotypically distinct human conditions. We found that expression of these genes is greatly upregulated in specific tissues during development, particularly in the cranial neural crest (CNC) and ventral mesoderm, and broadly correlates with common ribosome disease phenotypes. While the general pattern of expression is similar for all examined genes, unexpected differences do exist. Overall our study reveals extensive spatiotemporal regulation of ribosome biogenesis factor expression during embryonic development.", "citance": "In support, reduction of Rpl38 in mice can alter the composition of Hox gene mRNAs translation and embryonic patterning, without reducing overall protein synthesis [6] .", "claims": [{"text": "Reduction of Rpl38 affects embryonic patterning in mice without lowering overall protein synthesis.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Reduction of Rpl38 alters the composition of the Hox gene mRNAs translation in mice without lowering overall protein synthesis.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

The signalling mechanisms that regulate neuronal excitability are particularly important for processes such as sensory perception, cognition and consciousness. The Ca2+ signalling pathway is a key component of the mechanisms responsible for regulating neuronal excitability, information processing and cognition. Alterations in gene transcription are particularly important as they result in subtle alterations in the neuronal signalling mechanisms that have been implicated in many neural diseases. In particular, dysregulation of the Ca2+ signalling pathway has been implicated in the development of some of the major psychiatric diseases such as bipolar disorder (BPD) and schizophrenia.", "citation_paragraph": "The gene for neuregulin-1 (NRG1) acts through the ErbB3 signalling pathway to maintain the GABAergic phenotype (Ross et al. 2006; Buonanno 2010) . NRG1 controls the expression of various NMDAR signalling functions such as NMDAR itself, the scaffolding protein PSD95 that links the NMDAR to neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR; Fig. 4 ). ACh can facilitate the release of glutamate at presynaptic endings by acting through ionotropic nAChRs (Sharma and Vijayaraghavan 2003) . In patients with schizophrenia, the expression of nAChRs, which is regulated by this NRG1/ErbB pathway, is reduced and this could contribute to the hypofunction of the glutamatergic signalling pathway. Mutations in NRG1 decrease the activity of its protein and may thus contribute to the hypofunction of the NMDAR and a remodelling of the GABAergic phenotype. A reduction in the activity of the NRG1/ErbB3 signalling pathway also inhibits the Src kinase, which is a regulator of the NMDAR (Pitcher et al. 2011) . & DAOA, DAO and serine racemase Polymorphisms in G72, which codes for DAOA, a protein that acts normally to modulate the metabolism of D-serine, have been implicated in susceptibility to schizophrenia and BPD (Chumakov et al. 2002; Shinkai et al. 2007; Labrie and Roder 2010) . Mutations of this gene enhance the activity of the DAO that degrades D-serine. In addition, there are indications that mutations in DAO, which metabolises D-serine (Corvin et al. 2007; Shinkai et al. 2007 ) and in the serine racemase, which converts Lserine to D-serine (Morita et al. 2007) , are also linked to schizophrenia. The consequences of all these mutations would account for the lower levels of D-serine that have been observed in patients with schizophrenia (Hashimoto et al. 2005; Bendikov et al. 2007 ). Such a decline would Fig. 4 GABAergic inhibitory neuronal signalling pathways in schizophrenia. Inhibition of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) by reactive oxygen species (ROS) reduces Ca 2+ entry, which in turn reduces gene expression leading to a number of signalling defects.

A gain-of-function mutation of CACNA1C has also been linked to Timothy syndrome, which is a multisystem disorder characterised by cardiac arrhythmia, developmental abnormalities such as syndactyly, immune deficiency and behavioural abnormalities that resemble autism (Splawski et al. 2004) . Just how these mutations influence the function of the L-type Ca V 1.2 channel in BPD and schizophrenia is unclear. However, any alteration in the gating properties of this channel is likely to have a profound effect on neural function given that it has a central role in the control of neural gene transcription (as described earlier, see Fig. 2 ) and it also regulates both excitability and synaptic plasticity (Moosmang et al. 2005; Lacinova et al. 2008) . Such an action is consistent with observations that alterations in the activity of the brain circuits, which function in emotional and memory processing in regions such as the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, have been described in BPD and schizophrenia (Bigos et al. 2010; Erk et al. 2010) . & miR-137 A polymorphism of the MIR137 gene, which controls the expression of genes such as CACNA1C (see above), CSMD1 (CUB and Sushi multiple domains 1) and TCF4 (transcription factor 4), has been implicated in schizophrenia (Guella et al. 2013) . The miR-137 may also control the expression of a number of other schizophrenia risk genes such as ErbB4, the GABA receptor gene (GABRA1), the NMDA receptor 2A subunit gene (GRIN2A), the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 gene (GRM5), the GSK-3\u03b2 gene (GSK3B), the neuregulin 2 gene (NRG2) and the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2 gene (HTR2C), all of which have important roles in regulating many neuronal cell functions (Wright et al. 2013) .", "citance": "A reduction in the activity of the NRG1/ErbB3 signalling pathway also inhibits the Src kinase, which is a regulator of the NMDAR (Pitcher et al. 2011) .", "claims": [{"text": "Reduction of the NRG1/ErbB3 signalling pathway activates Src kinase.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Reduction of the NRG1/ErbB3 signalling pathway inbihits Src kinase.

The Swc2 subunit of SWR-C bound a narrowly defined region in the adjacent nucleosome-free region (NFR), where it positioned the Swr1 subunit over one of two sites of H2A.Z deposition at +1. The genomic binding maps suggest that many subunits have a rather plastic organization that allows subunits to exchange between the two complexes. One outcome of promoting H2A/H2A.Z exchange was an enhanced turnover of entire nucleosomes, thereby creating dynamic chromatin at the start of genes.

The Swr1 and Ino80 subunits of the respective complexes are related through their ''split'' ATPase domains and are more distantly related to the ATPase subunits of the SWI/SNF, ISW, and CHD families of chromatin remodelers. A number of subunits are shared between SWR-C and INO80. For example, Rvb1 and Rvb2 are paralogs that constitute a heteromeric dodecamer helicase in both complexes in vitro . It has been found, however, that Rvb1 and Rvb2 regulate distinct sets of genes (J\u00f3 nsson et al., 2001) and, in addition to their presence in SWR-C and INO80, can form homomeric hexamer helicases (Grigoletto et al., 2011; Huber et al., 2008; Huen et al., 2010; Jha and Dutta, 2009 ). These observations and the fact that many of the subunits associated with SWR-C and INO80 are energetically charged with ATP and are thus potentially dynamic raise the possibility that their in vivo organization is considerably more complex than indicated by the biochemistry.H2A.Z resides at nearly all $5,000 +1 nucleosomes out of a pool of $60,000 total nucleosomes genome wide in yeast cells (Albert et al., 2007; Raisner et al., 2005) .

Hence, the challenge is to understand, in their natural physiological context, how SWR-C and INO80 are organized in terms of both their structure and their position around each +1 nucleosome and to determine the mechanism by which these complexes achieve selectivity for +1 nucleosomes.Here, we use ultrahigh-resolution mapping of protein-genome interactions by ChIP-exo to identify the nucleosomes targeted by 20 SWR-C and INO80 components in vivo, and we define their structural/positional organization around these nucleosomes. The patterns of protein-genome contacts, occupancy correlations, impact of subunit deletions, and measurements of histone exchange suggest an in vivo mechanism by which a subcomplex within SWR-C and INO80 localizes to the NFR and dictates which nucleosomes are targeted for histone turnover via the dynamic cycling of H2A.Z.", "citance": "One major regulatory event includes the replacement of histone H2A with its variant H2A.Z, which destabilizes +1 nucleosomes so as to accelerate gene activation (Guillemette et al., 2005; Jin and Felsenfeld, 2007; Li et al., 2005; Meneghini et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005) .H2A.Z is incorporated into chromatin by SWR-C/SWR1 and is removed by INO80 (Mizuguchi et al., 2004; PapamichosChronakis et al., 2011) .", "claims": [{"text": "Replacement of histone H2A with H2A.Z accelerates gene activation in yeasts by destabilizing +1 nucleosomes.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Replacement of histone H2A with H2A.Z slows gene activation in yeasts by stabilizing +1 nucleosomes.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}

The induction, progression, and the rupture of atherosclerotic lesions have been closely associated with inflammatory mediators (4) . Cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-12, interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3), and IL-18 have essential roles in the formation and progression of atherosclerotic plaques. IL-18, also known as IFN-\u03b3-inducing factor, was determined in Kupffer cells and macrophages (5) . In addition, IL-18 has been shown to have proinflammatory, proapoptotic, and proatherogenic activities in diabetes and CVD (6, 7) . IL-18 expression is tissue-specific, which depends on its promoter region (8, 9) . Furthermore, patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have been found to have augmented IL-18 levels (10) . A study reported that IL-18 blockage is associated with diminished atherosclerotic lesion formation and advancement in experimentally ApoE-deficient mice (11) . Moreover, IL-18 levels are found to be 3-fold higher in unstable lesions than in stable plaques. Furthermore, repression of IL-18 has been shown to have positive effects on lesion composition and progression (12) . Therefore, IL-18 is a significant agent of atherosclerotic lesion destabilization and vulnerability. IL-18-binding protein (IL-18-BP) balances IL-18 activity through high-affinity binding with IL-18, which prevents IL-18 from binding to its receptor. Improved intensity of atherosclerosis may be related to changes in IL-18/IL-18-BP balance, and elevated free IL-18 levels have been identified in the circulation of disease states (13) (14) (15) (16) . Human IL-18 rs187238 has allelic variations at the \u2212137 position of the promoter region resulting in a guanine-to-cytosine (G/C) substitution. Rs187238 has been reported to be in complete linkage disequilibrium with two additional variations, at position +113 and +127, and regulates IL-18 production in mononuclear cells (17) . Rs187238 variants also influence IL-18 transcriptional activity (17) (18) (19) . In addition, circulating IL-18 levels showed a positive correlation with carotid intima-media thickness (20) . To our knowledge, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-specific mRNA levels of IL-18 and IL-18-BP in patients with CAS and the relationship with SNP rs187238 have not yet been investigated. Given that inflammation is a significant risk factor for atherosclerosis and the associated macrovascular and microvascular complications, we hypothesized that the mRNA expression of IL-18 and IL-18-BP, along with rs187238 SNP, may have a significant role in CAS development. Therefore, we explored whether IL-18 and IL-18-BP expression and IL-18 rs187238 \u2212137 G/C variants were associated with CAS.", "citance": "Furthermore, repression of IL-18 has been shown to have positive effects on lesion composition and progression (12) .", "claims": [{"text": "Repressing IL-18 has negative effects on atherosclerotic lesion composition and progression.", "subject": "IL-18", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Repressing IL-18 has positive effects on atherosclerotic lesion composition and progression.", "subject": "IL-18", "is_negation": false}]}

With the recent introduction of West Nile virus (1999), chikungunya virus (2013) and Zika virus (2015) to the Americas, stopping or even preventing the expansion of viruses into susceptible populations is an increasing concern. With a few exceptions, available vaccines protecting against arboviral infections are nonexistent and current disease prevention relies on vector control interventions. However, due to the emergence of and rapidly spreading insecticide resistance, different disease control methods are needed. A feasible method of reducing emerging tropical diseases is the implementation of vaccines that prevent or decrease viral infection in the vector. These vaccines are designated 'transmission blocking vaccines', or TBVs. Here, we summarize previous TBV work, discuss current research on arboviral TBVs and present several promising TBV candidates.", "citation_paragraph": "West Nile virus WNV is a zoonotic arbovirus member of the Flavivirus genus and it is naturally maintained in an enzootic cycle between birds and mosquitoes [71] . Birds are the natural reservoir for WNV able to develop a transient high viremic titer allowing transmission of WNV to mosquitoes that preferentially feed on these birds. Migratory birds are of importance since they can carry the virus from one region to another [72] . Most bird infections with WNV results in non-fatal outcomes conferring a permanent immunity after infection [73] . However, several bird species, specially from the family Corvidae, do not usually survive WNV infection and are useful in tracking virus spread through dead-bird surveillance programs [74] .In addition, WNV virus infects horses and can be transmitted to humans in close contact with these animals [75] . Humans and horses are infected as incidental deadend hosts with insufficient viremia to perpetuate the transmission cycle, but this virus is able to cause small outbreaks in na\u00efve populations [76] . Before 1990, this disease occurred sporadically as a minor risk for humans. The first cases of severe WNV were reported between 1994 and 1996 during the Algeria and Romania outbreaks where neurological complications were reported in several cases [77, 78] . WNV has now spread globally and although majority of infections are asymptomatic, elder populations as well as immune-compromised individuals are at high risk of severe disease [79] . The incidence of WNV has also increased worldwide in the last decade and now is the major cause of human encephalitis in USA [80, 81] . One of the major epidemics in USA occurred in 2012 with more than 5000 human cases reported in 48 states that resulted in 286 deaths [82] .Several species are important vectors of WNV in USA, with Culex pipiens as one of the most important vectors, followed by Culex quinquifasciatus and Culex tarsalis [83] . However, at least 59 mosquito species have been identified as potential vectors and ten species have been confirmed as important vectors [84] . Consequently, continued surveillance as well as preventive methods are in need to control WNV infections in USA and worldwide.Recent studies have demonstrated the role of C-type lectins in the establishment of Flavivirus, including WNV infection, in both mammals and the mosquito vector [85, 86] . For instance, Cheng et al. (2010) demonstrated that the knockdown of mosGCTL-1, or the feeding of mosquitoes with specific antibodies against the Aedes aegypti protein mosGCTL-1, significantly reduced WNV infection in both Aedes and Culex mosquitoes [65] . An upregulation of this protein is induced upon infection with WNV [65] . This study also showed that the Ae. aegypti C-type lectin (mosGCTL-1) interacts with WNV in a way that facilitates infection. MosGCTL-1 protein is recruited by mosPTP-1, an Ae. aegypti mosquito homolog of human CD45, which is a member of the of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family. The interaction between mosGCTL-1 and mos-PTP-1 allows viral attachment to cells and enhances viral entry. Furthermore, both proteins are critical for WNV infection as demonstrated in experiments with Culex quinquifasciatus, the most competent vector for this virus [67] . Taking all this information together, mosGCTL-1 could be a potential target for a TBV against WNV.", "citance": "An upregulation of this protein is induced upon infection with WNV [65] .", "claims": [{"text": "Repression of mosGCTL-1 is induced upon infection with West Nile virus.", "subject": "mosGCTL-1", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Upregulation of mosGCTL-1 is induced upon infection with West Nile virus.

These receptors are reported to activate transcription through ligand-dependent interactions with co-regulators and are involved in the development of secondary lymphoid tissues, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, the circadian rhythm, and metabolism homeostasis. Researches on RORs contributing to cancer-related processes have been growing, and they provide evidence that RORs are likely to be considered as potential therapeutic targets in many cancers. ROR\u03b1 has been identified as a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer and has been investigated in melanoma, colorectal colon cancer, and gastric cancer. ROR\u03b2 is mainly expressed in the central nervous system, but it has also been studied in pharyngeal cancer, uterine leiomyosarcoma, and colorectal cancer, in addition to neuroblastoma, and recent studies suggest that ROR\u03b3 is involved in various cancers, including lymphoma, melanoma, and lung cancer. Some studies found ROR\u03b3 to be upregulated in cancer tissues compared with normal tissues, while others indicated the opposite results. With respect to the mechanisms of RORs in cancer, previous studies on the regulatory mechanisms of RORs in cancer were mostly focused on immune cells and cytokines, but lately there have been investigations concentrating on RORs themselves.

{"s2orc_id": 51959086, "title": "G\u03b1i3 signaling is associated with sexual dimorphic expression of the clock-controlled output gene Dbp in murine liver", "abstract": "The albumin D-box binding protein (DBP) is a member of the PAR bZip (proline and acidic amino acid-rich basic leucine zipper) transcription factor family and functions as important regulator of circadian core and output gene expression. Gene expression of DBP itself is under the control of E-box-dependent binding by the Bmal1-Clock heterodimer and CRE-dependent binding by the cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB). However, the signaling mechanism mediating CREB-dependent regulation of DBP expression in the peripheral clock remains elusive. In this study, we examined the role of the GPCR (G-protein-coupled receptor)/G\u03b1i3 (Galphai3) controlled cAMP-CREB signaling pathway in the regulation of hepatic expression of core clock and clock-regulated genes, including Dbp. Analysis of circadian gene expression revealed that rhythmicity of hepatic transcript levels of the majority of core clock (including Per1) and clock-regulated genes were not affected by G\u03b1i3 deficiency. Consistently, the period length of primary G\u03b1i3 deficient tail fibroblasts expressing a Bmal1-Luciferase reporter was not affected. Interestingly, however, G\u03b1i3 deficient female but not male mice showed a tendentiously increased activation of CREB (nuclear pSer133-CREB) accompanied by an advanced peak in Dbp gene expression and elevated mRNA levels of the cytochrome P450 family member Cyp3a11, a target gene of DBP. Accordingly, selective inhibition of CREB led to a strongly decreased expression of DBP and CYP3A4 (human Cyp3a11 homologue) in HepG2 liver cells. In summary, our data suggest that the G\u03b1i3-pCREB signalling pathway functions as a regulator of sexual-dimorphic expression of DBP and its xenobiotic target enzymes Cyp3a11/CYP3A4.", "citation_paragraph": "This study provides novel insight into the role of the heterotrimeric G protein G\u03b1 i3 as upstream regulator of the cAMP-pCREB signalling pathway in rhythmic gene expression in the liver. Our data indicate (i) that gene ablation of G\u03b1 i3 in mice has only modest effects on overall core clock and clock output gene expression and does not affect the period length of clock gene expression; (ii) interestingly, slightly increased levels of nuclear activated CREB (pSer133-CREB) which are linked to a phaseshifted and increased expression of its potential target gene and PAR bZip transcription factor DBP is detectable in livers from G\u03b1 i3 deficient female mice; (iii) accordingly, the DBP target gene and cytochrome P 450 family member Cyp3a11 is found at higher transcript levels in the liver of G\u03b1 i3 \u2212/\u2212 female mice. Thus, G\u03b1 i3 may function as novel regulator of sexual-dimorphic, cAMP-PKA-pCREB driven expression of DBP together with its xenobiotic target genes in the liver ( Figure 5 ). Of note, selective inhibition of CREB led to a clearly decreased expression of DBP and CYP3A4 (human Cyp3a11 homologue) in HepG2 hepatoma cells (Supplementary Figures 9 and  10 ) further stressing the downstream role of CREB in the regulation of DBP and its target genes.The phenotypic characterization of G\u03b1 i deficient mouse lines has been expanded in the recent years revealing that G\u03b1 i2 and G\u03b1 i3 take over gene-specific as well as shared physiological functions in various organs and cell types in-vivo [28, 29, [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] . The liver expresses both G\u03b1 i2 and G\u03b1 i3 with the latter exhibiting an isoformspecific and crucial function in the anti-autophagic action of insulin in hepatocytes [29] . Although a comparative characterization of the hepatic expression of core clock and clock-regulated genes in G\u03b1 i2 knockout mice is not yet available, we provide evidence that G\u03b1 i3 deficiency per se alters expression of DBP and its target genes in a G\u03b1 i isform-specific manner apparently via a desinhibited cAMP-pCREB pathway.Several observations emphasize a critical role of GPCR/G s (cAMP\u2191) and GPCR/G i (cAMP\u2193) pathways in the regulation of rhythmic gene expression. Interestingly, Cry1 interacts directly with Ga s at the GPCR level and thereby inhibits adenylyl cyclase activity and accumulation of cAMP and activation of CREB [24] . These findings provided an explanation how the rhythmic expression of Cry1 translates directly into a circadian regulation of cAMP signaling in hepatic glucose metabolism, in particular gluconeogenesis [24] . Moreover, functional inactivation of G i -proteins by pertussis toxin [42] or a reduction of cAMP levels by MDL-12330A mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase led to a desynchronized circadian gene expression in the SCN and an altered circadian rhythmicity [43, 44] . Here, although the identity of the involved GPCRs in the regulation of circadian signaling is currently only speculative, the G i /G q -coupled melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 [45] represent prime candidates given that they play an important role in central clock synchronization. MT1 and MT2 are both expressed in the liver [46] where they display circadian rhythmic changes in gene expression [47] . Interestingly, and consistent with our findings in Figure 2 , DBP mRNA levels are phase-advanced in mice lacking either MT1, MT2, or both receptors [46, 48] , indicating that these GPCRs are involved in the regulation of DBP expression. However, since the mouse lines analyzed in this study were on the melatonin-deficient C57Bl/6 genetic background [49] , backcrossing with mice on the melatonin proficient C3H background is a prerequisite to ultimately determine changes in melatonin receptor signaling and rhythmic hepatic gene expression upon G\u03b1 i3 deficiency.In terms of the regulation of DBP expression, previous work showed that maximal and minimal levels of DBP mRNA occur approximately four hours later in the liver as compared to the SCN [50] , suggesting that additional regulatory mechanisms (besides transcriptional control via E-box elements) must be involved in the control of rhythmic DBP expression in peripheral tissues when compared to the SCN [13, [51] [52] [53] [54] . Indeed, treatment of Rat-1 fibroblasts with the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin was sufficient to increase cAMPpCREB signalling and trigger circadian expression of DBP [16, 55] . These findings indicate that candidate cAMP inducible promoter elements (CRE) and pCREB binding sites [56] , which are regulated by G\u03b1 i3 -mediated signaling, are present in the Dbp gene (\"direct model\"). Indeed, besides the two E-box binding sites (5'-CACGTC-3'), two CRE half sites (5'-CGTCA-3') can be detected in the promoter region of the murine Dbp gene (Singh and Piekorz, unpublished). However, it remains to be determined whether these sites function as pCREB binding elements. Alternatively, one could envision that the subcellular (nuclear vs. cytoplasmic) distribution of BMAL-1/CLOCK, that regulates Dbp gene expression through E-box binding [57] , has become disturbed by G\u03b1 i3 deficiency in hepatocytes (\"indirect model\"). So far, however, we failed to detect any obvious differences in nuclear vs. cytoplasmic CLOCK protein levels between wild-type and G\u03b1 i3 deficient hepatocytes at ZT6 and ZT12 (Supplementary Figure 11) .Increasing evidence argues for a role of sexual dimorphism in life span regulation, disease sensitivity, and particularly drug metabolism in females vs. males [3, [58] [59] [60] [61] . The liver represents a bona fide sexualdimorphic organ with a rhythmic physiology especially in terms of its detoxification function [62, 63] . In these regards, indications for a sexual dimorphic signalling and expression of core clock and clock regulated genes in the liver include based on our study (i) slightly to significantly higher transcript levels of Per1 and Per2 in females vs. males (Supplementary Figure 4) , (ii) potential differences in pCREB signalling given the levels and rhythms of pSer133-CREB in female vs. male animals (Supplementary Figure 6 ; Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure 7) , (iii) a phase-shifted expression of DBP that became particularly evident when comparing wild-type (Supplementary Figure  3A) and G\u03b1 i3 knockout (Supplementary Figure 3B ) of both Figure 5 : schematic model suggesting a putative role of the Ga s /G\u03b1 i3 -creb signalling pathways in sexually-dimorphic regulation of dbP expression in female vs. male mouse liver. In females, loss of G\u03b1 i3 leads presumably via desinhibition of adenylyl cyclase and hence increased pSer133-CREB levels to a phase-advanced and increased expression of DBP in the liver, concomitant with an increase in transcript levels of Cyp3a11, a putative DBP target gene. In G\u03b1 i3 -/-males, this signalling pathway may be less active provided that an increased CRY1 expression (as indicated in Figure 1 ) results in a stronger inhibitory role of CRY1 on cAMP levels (via G s inhibition) [24] . B: BMAL1; C: CLOCK; CRE: cAMP responsive element; CREB, cAMP response element binding protein; CRY1, cryptochrome circadian clock 1; Cyp3a11: cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily a, polypeptide 11; DBP: albumin D-box binding protein; PKA: protein kinase A; G i3 and G s : heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding proteins which upon activation cause a decrease or increase in intracellular cAMP levels, respectively. sexes, and (iv) a significantly higher circadian expression of CYP2A4/2A5 in females vs. males independent of the genotype (Supplementary Figure 8) . As summarized in the model in Figure 5 , in G\u03b1 i3 \u2212/\u2212 males, the cAMP-PKApCREB signalling pathway may be less active provided that the increased CRY1 expression ( Figure 1B ) results in a stronger inhibitory role of CRY1 on cAMP levels (via G s inhibition) essentially as suggested by Zhang et al. [24] . Of note, the increased CRY1 expression in G\u03b1 i3 \u2212/\u2212 males could be due to a phase shift/earlier onset of Cry1 expression between ZT12 and ZT18, given that ZT intervals of six hours (instead of four hours) have been analyzed in this study.CYP2A4/2A5 belongs to the cytochrome P 450 family of monooxygenases, whose expression is under diurnal control by the circadian clock via PAR bZip proteins, including DBP. These transcription factors also control the expression of additional enzymes and regulators involved in endobiotic and xenobiotic biotransformation and drug metabolism [15] . In particular, DBP per se is able to transcriptionally regulate the circadian accumulation of the target genes CYP2A4 (Steroid 15\u03b1-hydroxylase), CYP2A5 (Coumarin 7-hydroxylase), and CYP3A4 (Cyp3a11 in mouse [32] ), given that these genes display D-box elements in their promotor regions [64, 65] . CYP2A4/CYP2A5 is involved in cholesterol and bile acid metabolism [64] , whereas CYP3A4/Cyp3a11 plays an important role in the metabolism of endogenous steroids and is responsible for biotransformation of approximately 50% of all prescription drugs [65, 66] . The profound role of PAR bZip family members especially in the regulation of drug metabolism and biotransformation [15] becomes particularly obvious in triple knockout mice lacking Dbp, Hlf, and Tef. These animals display a deregulated expression of numerous cytochrome P 450 gene family members, an increased sensitivity to xenobiotics, and phenotypic alterations reminiscent of premature aging [12] .In summary, taking our findings in account it remains to be particularly tested whether an increased signaling by the cAMP-pCREB-DBP axis in the liver of G\u03b1 i3 \u2212/\u2212 female mice translates into an increased Cyp3a11 activity and therefore improved biotransformation.", "citance": "These findings provided an explanation how the rhythmic expression of Cry1 translates directly into a circadian regulation of cAMP signaling in hepatic glucose metabolism, in particular gluconeogenesis [24] .", "claims": [{"text": "Rhythmic expression of Cry1 translates directly into a circadian regulation of cAMP signaling in gluconeogenesis.", "subject": "Cry1", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Rhythmic expression of Cry1 translates directly into a circadian regulation of cAMP signaling in hepatic glucose metabolism.

Leveraging the extensive knowledge of yeast transcriptional regulation, we uncovered significant regulatory variation in individual yeast cells, both before and after stress.

Defects in ribosome biogenesis and function result in a group of human disorders, collectively known as ribosomopathies. In this study, we describe a zebrafish mutant with a loss-of-function mutation in nol9, a gene that encodes a non-ribosomal protein involved in rRNA processing. nol9sa1022/sa1022 mutants have a defect in 28S rRNA processing. The nol9sa1022/sa1022 larvae display hypoplastic pancreas, liver and intestine and have decreased numbers of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), as well as definitive erythrocytes and lymphocytes. In addition, ultrastructural analysis revealed signs of pathological processes occurring in endothelial cells of the caudal vein, emphasizing the complexity of the phenotype observed in nol9sa1022/sa1022 larvae. We further show that both the pancreatic and hematopoietic deficiencies in nol9sa1022/sa1022 embryos were due to impaired cell proliferation of respective progenitor cells. Interestingly, genetic loss of Tp53 rescued the HSPCs but not the pancreatic defects. In contrast, activation of mRNA translation via the mTOR pathway by L-Leucine treatment did not revert the erythroid or pancreatic defects. Together, we present the nol9sa1022/sa1022 mutant, a novel zebrafish ribosomopathy model, which recapitulates key human disease characteristics. The use of this genetically tractable model will enhance our understanding of the tissue-specific mechanisms following impaired ribosome biogenesis in the context of an intact vertebrate.", "citation_paragraph": "Ribosome biogenesis is a highly conserved and remarkably complex process that is essential for cell growth and proliferation. It utilizes 60% of total cellular transcription in a growing yeast cell, with 2,000 ribosomes synthesized every minute [1] . It requires the coordinated action of all three RNA polymerases (RNAP I, II, III) and the synthesis of 4 ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), 82 core ribosomal proteins (RPs), more than 200 non-ribosomal proteins and approximately 70 small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) [2] . While complete loss of expression of genes encoding ribosomal components has not been described in humans, haploinsufficiency or partial loss of protein expression of some ribosome biogenesis proteins has been shown to be a common basis of the group of disorders known collectively as \"ribosomopathies\" [3] . Although all ribosomopathies involve ribosomal dysfunction, they show different modes of inheritance and the clinical presentations may vary even among patients carrying the same mutation. Clinical features of the ribosomopathies include defects in growth and development, craniofacial and skeletal defects, hematological abnormalities with increased propensity to the development of malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) [3] . Ribosomopathies that present with hematological defects include Diamond Blackfan anemia (DBA), 5q -syndrome, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Additional examples of ribosomopathies include Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS), isolated congenital asplenia (ICAS), aplasia cutis congenita (ACC), BowenConradi syndrome (BCS), North American Indian Childhood cirrhosis (NAIC) and alopecia, neurological defects and endocrinopathy (ANE) syndrome [4] . One of the most intriguing aspects of ribosomopathies is that, despite the fact that they all share a common defect in the same biological process there is a high degree of cell and tissue-specific pathology [5] . Evidence from a number of model systems suggested activation of Tp53 [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] and mTOR [17, 18] pathways following ribosome dysfunction. However, modulation of these pathways had variable success in reverting tissue specific phenotypes in different models of ribosomopathies, again emphasizing the complexity of these disorders. This lack of basic insight into the molecular and biochemical defects that underlie ribosomopathies is reflected by a lack of effective therapeutic strategies, often resulting in poor outcomes for patients suffering from these disorders [3] . Current therapies include steroids and chronic transfusions for DBA patients and pancreatic enzyme replacement, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, antibiotics and transfusion support for SDS patients. The only definitive treatment for the hematopoietic defects in DBA and SDS is bone marrow transplantation [19, 20] . However, graft failure, graft versus host disease and infection contribute to the substantial morbidity and mortality associated with these treatments [19, 21] . Therefore, there is a need to develop novel, targeted, therapeutic strategies based on understanding the pathophysiology of these disorders; which is why ongoing work to generate optimal in vivo models is essential for further progress in the field.Here we report the identification and analysis of a zebrafish mutant with a loss-of-function mutation in the nol9 gene. The human NOL9 protein is a polynucleotide 5'-kinase involved in ribosome biogenesis [22] . It is a non-ribosomal protein that is required for cleavage of the ITS2 region from a pre-rRNA to generate 5.8S and 28S rRNAs and for the synthesis of the 60S ribosomal subunit [22] . Similarly, the NOL9 homolog in S. pombe, Grc3, is required for pre-rRNA processing, particularly ITS2 processing [23] . In this study, we demonstrate that nol9 sa1022/sa1022 mutants have a defect in pre-rRNA processing within ITS2. As in the majority of congenital syndromes in human, zebrafish nol9 sa1022/sa1022 larvae had multiple organ failures including intestine, liver, pancreas and impaired definitive erythropoiesis and lymphopoiesis. These phenotypic features of nol9 sa1022/sa1022 mutants are reminiscent of the clinical symptoms of Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, an autosomal recessive ribosomopathy [24] [25] [26] [27] that is characterized by exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, hematological abnormalities including neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia and skeletal defects. Our detailed characterization of nol9 sa1022/sa1022 larvae further shows that both pancreatic and erythroid defects are due to impaired proliferation as well as differentiation of respective progenitor cell types. Additionally, we show that impaired erythropoiesis, but not pancreatic development, is rescued in double knock out nol9 sa1022/ sa1022 /tp53 zdf1/zdf1 larvae.", "citance": "One of the most intriguing aspects of ribosomopathies is that, despite the fact that they all share a common defect in the same biological process there is a high degree of cell and tissue-specific pathology [5] .", "claims": [{"text": "Ribosomopathies have a high degree of cell and tissue specific pathology.

{"s2orc_id": 1808963, "title": "Dynamic Spatiotemporal Trends of Dengue Transmission in the Asia-Pacific Region, 1955\u20132004", "abstract": "BACKGROUND Dengue fever (DF) is one of the most important emerging arboviral human diseases. Globally, DF incidence has increased by 30-fold over the last fifty years, and the geographic range of the virus and its vectors has expanded. The disease is now endemic in more than 120 countries in tropical and subtropical parts of the world. This study examines the spatiotemporal trends of DF transmission in the Asia-Pacific region over a 50-year period, and identified the disease's cluster areas.   METHODOLOGY AND FINDINGS The World Health Organization's DengueNet provided the annual number of DF cases in 16 countries in the Asia-Pacific region for the period 1955 to 2004. This fifty-year dataset was divided into five ten-year periods as the basis for the investigation of DF transmission trends. Space-time cluster analyses were conducted using scan statistics to detect the disease clusters. This study shows an increasing trend in the spatiotemporal distribution of DF in the Asia-Pacific region over the study period. Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Singapore and Malaysia are identified as the most likely clusters (relative risk = 13.02) of DF transmission in this region in the period studied (1995 to 2004). The study also indicates that, for the most part, DF transmission has expanded southwards in the region.   CONCLUSIONS This information will lead to the improvement of DF prevention and control strategies in the Asia-Pacific region by prioritizing control efforts and directing them where they are most needed.", "citation_paragraph": "The results of this study indicate that the geographical range of DF transmission in the Asia-Pacific region expanded during the 1955-2004 period. On average, at least two countries joined the DF cluster areas every ten years. There are many factors that could be responsible for the geographic spread of DF in the region during the 20 th century; for example, unprecedented population growth, unplanned urbanization, a lack of effective vector control, and international travel [23, 24] . The movement of troops and materials during World War II might also have played a crucial role in the dissemination of the Aedes mosquitoes and the virus [24, 25] . Another possibly important factor was the enormous economic growth in Southeast Asia after World War II [6, 26] . This economic growth led to unplanned urbanization, which resulted in millions of people living in shanty towns with inadequate housing, water supplies and waste management facilities. These overcrowded communities with large mosquito populations create ideal conditions for DF transmission [27] [28] [29] . In addition, the increased use of modern transportation resulting from globalization is responsible for the importation of the dengue virus through both viremic individuals and the dispersal of exotic mosquitoes into new areas. It has been suggested, for example, that Aedes albopictus was introduced into many Pacific islands through modern container ships [23, 30] .Global climate change is also suggested as an important factor in the extent of the expansion of DF in Asia [31] . A recent study in Taiwan shows that urbanization and increased temperature due to climate change are the most important risk factors for its transmission [17] . Climatic factors including temperature, rainfall and humidity have direct and indirect impacts on mosquito survival, their life span and reproductive rate. This, in turn, can influence the geographic distribution of the virus and vectors [32] . Indeed, an association between DF incidence and rainfall has been reported in many countries of the Asia-Pacific region where outbreaks usually coincide with the rainy season [33] . This is because rainfall can potentially increase the number of mosquito breeding sites which, in turn, increases the chance of DF transmission [34] . Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Singapore and Malaysia are identified as the most likely DF clusters in the most recent years of the study (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) . DF transmission in these areas follows a cyclical pattern, with the highest incidence in the hot and rainy seasons from May to October [35, 36] . We also know that DF infection in travelers varies according to destination, season of travel, duration of stay and epidemic activity. Therefore, travelers to these cluster countries need to take precautions, such as avoiding the monsoon season and shortening the duration of their stay if a DF outbreak occurs. This awareness could significantly reduce the risk of DF transmission to non-endemic areas.Our results also suggest that the geographic spread of DF in the Asia-Pacific region could have originated in the Philippines or Thailand, as these two countries were identified as DF clusters as early as 1960. Many other studies also suggest that the Philippines or Thailand could be the origin of DF transmission in Asia [7] . Historically, the first severe DF outbreak occurred in Manila (Philippines) in 1953, and the second outbreak was in Bangkok (Thailand) [24, 37] .In the Asia-Pacific region, DF spread mainly in a southerly direction. Global climate change might explain this southward expansion to some extent. In the past 100 years, for example, mean surface temperature has increased by 0.3-0.8uC across the continent [38] . This could have created climatic conditions suitable for dengue mosquito vector, and facilitated its transmission in the region [26, 31, 39] . A southward spread of DF was also observed in Argentina and Australia [40] [41] [42] . However, this supposed southward spread has not yet been verified [43] .This study has several strengths. Most importantly, it is the first empirical study to explore the spatiotemporal pattern of DF transmission in the Asia-Pacific region. DF data from 16 countries over a period of 50 years were used in the study. It indicates the necessity for future research to assess important determinants of DF emergence and its rapid geographic spread in the region. It also suggests the importance of exploring DF transmission patterns within specific countries.The main limitation of this study is the low resolutions of the DF dataset, which only includes annual DF data. Higher resolution could be achieved by monthly or weekly data, which would show the seasonal variations in transmission. However, WHO DengueNet does not provide this information for most countries. Another limitation is the lack of available data from some DF endemic countries in the region, such as Taiwan and China. Inclusion of these data could increase the DF cluster area, and thus help to verify the southward expansion of DF in this region. A limitation also arises from quality issues with the WHO DengueNet data. For example, under-reporting is possible when countries do not report DF outbreak information for years. This information gap can bias study results. Over reporting is also possible, as some countries use only clinical diagnosis rather than serological diagnosis; the latter cannot differentiate DF from other diseases such as chikungunya.In summary, this study determined that the spatial and temporal distribution of DF in the Asia-Pacific region increased over the 50-year study period. Social, ecological and demographic changes that have occurred in recent years are thought to be responsible for the geographic spread of the disease. Global climate change can also contribute to this spread. Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Singapore and Malaysia are identified as the most likely clusters for DF in the Asia-Pacific region. This new knowledge can contribute to the improvement of DF prevention and control strategies in the region by prioritizing control efforts and directing them where they are most needed.", "citance": "A recent study in Taiwan shows that urbanization and increased temperature due to climate change are the most important risk factors for its transmission [17] .", "claims": [{"text": "Rising temperatures caused by global warming increases risk of dengue fever transmission.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Rising temperatures caused by global warming lowers the risk of dengue fever transmission.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Urbanization is an important risk factor related to the transmission of dengue fever.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

METHODS Subjects were randomly assigned to either open-label lisinopril (n = 100) or atenolol (n = 100) each administered three times per week after dialysis. Monthly monitored home blood pressure (BP) was controlled to <140/90 mmHg with medications, dry weight adjustment and sodium restriction. The primary outcome was the change in left ventricular mass index (LVMI) from baseline to 12 months.   RESULTS At baseline, 44-h ambulatory BP was similar in the atenolol (151.5/87.1 mmHg) and lisinopril groups, and improved similarly over time in both groups. However, monthly measured home BP was consistently higher in the lisinopril group despite the need for both a greater number of antihypertensive agents and a greater reduction in dry weight. An independent data safety monitoring board recommended termination because of cardiovascular safety. Serious cardiovascular events in the atenolol group occurred in 16 subjects, who had 20 events, and in the lisinopril group in 28 subjects, who had 43 events {incidence rate ratio (IRR) 2.36 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.36-4.23, P = 0.001]}. Combined serious adverse events of myocardial infarction, stroke and hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular death in the atenolol group occurred in 10 subjects, who had 11 events and in the lisinopril group in 17 subjects, who had 23 events (IRR 2.29, P = 0.021). Hospitalizations for heart failure were worse in the lisinopril group (IRR 3.13, P = 0.021). All-cause hospitalizations were higher in the lisinopril group [IRR 1.61 (95% CI 1.18-2.19, P = 0.002)]. LVMI improved with time; no difference between drugs was noted.   CONCLUSIONS Among maintenance dialysis patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy, atenolol-based antihypertensive therapy may be superior to lisinopril-based therapy in preventing cardiovascular morbidity and all-cause hospitalizations.

Among these patients, hypertension is common and is often poorly controlled [1] , and when measured in the interdialytic period with ambulatory blood pressure (BP), monitoring is strongly associated with all-cause mortality [2] [3] [4] . An important cause of hypertension is volume excess but even after aggressive volume management, many patients receiving thrice-weekly dialysis remain hypertensive [4, 5] . In such patients, nonvolume mechanisms-such as activation of the renin angiotensin system or the sympathoadrenal system-are important to sustain hypertension [6] . Meta-analyses of randomized trials suggest that the risk of cardiovascular events can be cut by a third by using antihypertensive drug therapy among hemodialysis patients especially when they are hypertensive [7, 8] . However, it is not clear whether one class of antihypertensive agent is superior to others in improving cardiovascular outcomes.Randomized trials among hypertensive people with left ventricular hypertrophy suggest that the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system is superior to the \u03b2-blockade in producing a regression of left ventricular hypertrophy and preventing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [9] . In this study, we hypothesized that among hypertensive patients on hemodialysis, targeted to a similar home BP goal measured monthly, the use of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (lisinopril) will be more effective than a \u03b2-blocker (atenolol)-based antihypertensive therapy in causing regression of left ventricular hypertrophy.", "citance": "Meta-analyses of randomized trials suggest that the risk of cardiovascular events can be cut by a third by using antihypertensive drug therapy among hemodialysis patients especially when they are hypertensive [7, 8] .", "claims": [{"text": "Risk of cardiovascular events can be cut by a third by using antihypertensive drug therapy among hemodialysis patients.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Recently, it has shown that ROS play a dual role as both deleterious and beneficial species depending on their concentration in MSCs. Various environmental stresses-induced excessive production of ROS triggers cellular senescence and abnormal differentiation on MSCs. Moreover, MSCs have been suggested to participate in the treatment of ALI/ARDS and COPD as a major cause of high morbidity and mortality. Therapeutic mechanisms of MSCs in the treatment of ARDS/COPD were focused on cell engraftment and paracrine action. However, ROS-mediated therapeutic mechanisms of MSCs still remain largely unknown. Here, we review the key factors associated with cell cycle and chromatin remodeling to accelerate or delay the MSC aging process. In addition, the enhanced ROS production and its associated pathophysiological pathways will be discussed along with the MSC senescence process. Furthermore, the present review highlights how the excessive amount of ROS-mediated oxidative stress might interfere with homeostasis of lungs and residual lung cells in the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS and COPD.", "citation_paragraph": "and p21 CIP1/WAF1 [32] . Currently, it is now known whether ROS mediated induction of HMGA2 may lead aging of MSCs. However, in various cancers, a high level of HMGA2 has been detected, and it is believed that HMGA2-related ROS production modifies redox regulation, leading to mold cellular phenotypes. In the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, TGF-sustained increases in the generation of ROS, as well as the induction of HMGA2 with a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and the glutathione level. When exogenous mitochondrial thioredoxin was treated in EMT, the TGF-mediated induction of HMGA2 was impaired in mammary epithelial cells [33] . These findings regarding the underlying mechanism in epithelialmesenchymal transition might be extended to delay stem cell aging in response to ROS.DNA methylation is involved in diverse biological process with the addition of a methyl group to the CpG dinucleotide in DNA. This methylation pattern is regarded as a fundamental constituent of the molecular mechanism, as well as a parameter to understand the correlation with chromatin structure remodeling. The alteration of the DNA methylation landscape has been analyzed to determine the characteristics between age-associated hematopoietic stem cell decline and the epigenome based on a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis. In hematopoietic stem cells, the specific DNA hypermethylation of Polycomb repressive complex 2 was accompanied by enforced proliferation-dependent aging [34] . Recently, it has been demonstrated that DNA methyltransferase enzymes (DNMTs) regulate histone marks, transcriptional enzymes, and the CpG island methylation status during the replicative senescence of MSCs. In MSCs, the inhibition of DNMT 1 and 3B with 5-azacytidine increased SA--gal activity through increased levels of p16INK4A and p21 WAF/Cip1 as a result of DNMTs downregulating the CDK2 and CDK4 expressions in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. In addition, the specific inhibition of DNMT1 and DNMT3b with siRNAs decreased EZH2 and BMI1, which are regulatory mediators of Polycomb repressive complexes at the mRNA and protein levels by controlling the expressions of microRNA-200c and 214 on the genomic region [35] . The ROS-mediated mechanism with DNMTs and Polycomb repressive complex genes has been described in cancer cells. Hydrogen peroxide induced the large complex of DNMT1 and 3B containing Sirtuin1 and Polycomb repressive complex 4. In these complexes, SIRT1 interacted with DNMT1 and they were recruited to hydrogen peroxide-induced double strand breaks [36] . In murine melanocytes, superoxide anion (O 2 \u2212 ), a species of ROS, upregulated the expressions of DNMTs through the RAS signaling pathway, which is capable of activating the DNMT promoter [37] . In neural stem cells, Bose et al. have shown dexamethasone-induced changes in global DNA methylation accompanied by decreased expressions of DNMTs (Figure 1 ). This phenomenon was underlying the transcriptional repression of the mitochondrialrespiratory chain enzymes of complex 1 (Nd3) and complex III (Cytb), leading to a long-lasting increased susceptibility to oxidative stress, such as the higher generated levels of intracellular ROS [38] .", "citance": "In these complexes, SIRT1 interacted with DNMT1 and they were recruited to hydrogen peroxide-induced double strand breaks [36] .", "claims": [{"text": "SIRT1 and DNMT1 are recruited to hydrogen peroxide-induced double strand breaks.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are classified as >200 nucleotides in length, but range up to several kb and are heterogeneous in genomic origin and function. lncRNAs fold into structures that interact with DNA, RNA and proteins to regulate chromatin dynamics, protein complex assembly, transcription, telomere biology and splicing. Some lncRNAs act as sponges for miRNAs and decoys for proteins. Nuclear-encoded lncRNAs can be taken up by mitochondria and lncRNAs are transcribed from mtDNA. Both miRNAs and lncRNAs are dysregulated in endocrine cancers. This review provides an overview on the current understanding of the regulation and function of selected lncRNAs and miRNAs, and their interaction, in endocrine-related cancers: breast, prostate, endometrial and thyroid.", "citation_paragraph": "The human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genome is transcribed as a polycistronic precursor and encodes 13 proteins that function in mt OXPHOS, two rRNAs that are components of the mt ribosome and 22 tRNA (Kim et al. 2017b) . Seven lncRNAs have been identified to be derived from mtDNA (De Paepe et al. 2017) . These are referred to as mitolncRNAs (Vendramin et al. 2017) . Several are chimeric lncRNAs containing nucleotides of mtDNA: LIPCAR, SncmtRNA, ASncmtRNA-1 and ASncmtRNA-2. LIPCAR is cardiac specific and levels are elevated in circulation of patients with chronic heart failure (Kumarswamy et al. 2014) . ASncmtRNA-1 and ASncmtRNA-2 are present in mitochondria and nuclei, suggesting a possible role in retrograde signaling (De Paepe et al. 2017) . ASncmtRNA-1 and ASncmtRNA-2 are downregulated in breast and prostate tumors (Burzio et al. 2009 ), suggesting tumor suppressor activity. However, complete knockdown of ASncmtRNA-1 and ASncmtRNA-2 stimulated apoptotic cell death by downregulating the translation of survivin, an anti-apoptotic protein, only in cancer cells through an undefined mechanism, although these lncRNAs were shown to interact with DICER (Vidaurre et al. 2014) . To date, the mechanism of ASncmtRNA-1 and ASncmtRNA-2 remains unknown (De Paepe et al. 2017 . Three lncRNAs: ncND5, lncND6 and lncCyt b were identified as antisense transcripts of the mtND5, mtND6 and mtCYTB mRNAs but little is known about their function (Rackham et al. 2011) . There is speculation that these three lncRNAs are transported to the nucleus by unknown RNA-binding proteins . Recently, two novel lncRNAs MDL1 and MDL1AS encoded in the D-loop of human mitochondrial DNA were discovered and identical transcripts were identified in mouse and rat genomes . RMRP (RNA Component Of Mitochondrial RNAProcessing Endoribonuclease) is a nuclear DNA-encoded lncRNA that binds RNA-binding proteins HUR, PNPASE and GRSF1 for transport into mitochondria where RMRP is the RNA component of the mitochondrial RNAprocessing endoribonuclease (RNase MRP) for mtDNA replication and RNA processing . RMRP acts as a sponge for miR-206 an oncogene in lung cancer (Meng et al. 2016) . Deep sequencing of 360 primary breast tumors identified mutations in the promoters of lncRNAs RMRP and NEAT1 that increased their expression and noted increased expression of these lncRNAs in breast tumors (Rheinbay et al. 2017) . However, RMRP's role in BCa remains to be fully elucidated, and no publications were found with respect to RMRP in prostate, endometrial, ovarian or thyroid cancer.SRA1, steroid receptor RNA activator, was first identified as an RNA transcript acting as an RNA coactivator in a complex with SRC-1 (NCOA1) to increase progesterone, glucocorticoid, androgen, estrogen, thyroid hormone, retinoic acid and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PR, GR, AR, ER\u03b1, TR\u03b2, RAR\u03b3, RXR\u03b3 and PPAR\u03b3) transcriptional activity (Lanz et al. 1999) . Knockout of Sra1 in mice showed that the Sra\u2212/\u2212 mice were resistant to high-fat diet-induced obesity and had lower fat mass . In humans, inactivating SRA1 mutations were identified in three families with a proband with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (Kotan et al. 2016) . The SRA1 gene also encodes a protein steroid receptor coactivator protein (SRAP) (reviewed in Leygue 2007) that interacts with AR and is involved in PCa (Kawashima et al. 2003) .

{"s2orc_id": 5934669, "title": "Inhibition of SRC family kinases and receptor tyrosine kinases by dasatinib: possible combinations in solid tumors.", "abstract": "Dasatinib is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets a wide variety of tyrosine kinases implicated in the pathophysiology of several neoplasias. Among the most sensitive dasatinib targets are ABL, the SRC family kinases (SRC, LCK, HCK, FYN, YES, FGR, BLK, LYN, and FRK), and the receptor tyrosine kinases c-KIT, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) \u03b1 and \u03b2, discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1), c-FMS, and ephrin receptors. Dasatinib inhibits cell duplication, migration, and invasion, and it triggers apoptosis of tumoral cells. As a consequence, dasatinib reduces tumoral mass and decreases the metastatic dissemination of tumoral cells. Dasatinib also acts on the tumoral microenvironment, which is particularly important in the bone, where dasatinib inhibits osteoclastic activity and favors osteogenesis, exerting a bone-protecting effect. Several preclinical studies have shown that dasatinib potentiates the antitumoral action of various drugs used in the oncology clinic, paving the way for the initiation of clinical trials of dasatinib in combination with standard-of-care treatments for the therapy of various neoplasias. Trials using combinations of dasatinib with ErbB/HER receptor antagonists are being explored in breast, head and neck, and colorectal cancers. In hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, trials using combinations of dasatinib with antihormonal therapies are ongoing. Dasatinib combinations with chemotherapeutic agents are also under development in prostate cancer (dasatinib plus docetaxel), melanoma (dasatinib plus dacarbazine), and colorectal cancer (dasatinib plus oxaliplatin plus capecitabine). Here, we review the preclinical evidence that supports the use of dasatinib in combination for the treatment of solid tumors and describe various clinical trials developed following a preclinical rationale.", "citation_paragraph": "The use of dasatinib in the clinic is not only supported by its success in the treatment of CML and ALL but also by preclinical studies that have indicated that dasatinib inhibits tumor progression acting on the tumoral cell and its microenvironment. Thus, diseases in which bone metastases are frequent (e.g., breast or prostate tumors) could benefit from the addition of dasatinib to standard-of-care treatments. Moreover, dasatinib targets proteins that participate in signaling by kinases that play a pathogenic role in cancer (e.g., HER2 in breast cancer). The ample spectrum of biological functions affected by dasatinib (Fig. 1 ) offers interesting strategies to fight different types of tumors, especially using dasatinib in combination with standardof-care treatments. Below, we comment on some representative clinical trials in diseases in which dasatinib use in combination may represent a rational strategy (Table 1) .Breast cancer. Different reasons justify the evaluation of dasatinib in breast cancer, including (i) SRC is overfunctional in a large proportion of breast cancer patients, (ii) SRC participates in signaling by HER receptors, (iii) dissemination of breast tumoral cells to the bone is frequent in this disease, and (iv) SRC has been linked to resistance to various therapies used in breast cancer. A recent study in which 615 breast cancer tumors were analyzed showed SRC activity to be tightly associated to the development of bone metastasis and late onset relapse to bone (37) . In that study, and using preclinical breast cancer models, treatment with dasatinib alone reduced breast cancer bone metastases.Breast cancer metastases to the bone are particularly frequent in estrogen receptor-positive (ER\u00fe) tumors. Interestingly, SRC plays a central role in the cross-talk between estrogen and androgen receptors (40, 41) , and SRC expression and activity have been linked to resistance to antihormonal therapy (42, 43) . These circumstances open the possibility of using dasatinib in the ER\u00fe clinical setting (i) to overcome resistance to endocrine therapies, (ii) to prevent the appearance of such resistance, and (iii) to avoid metastatic spreading to the bone and/or to reduce the already disseminated cells. The NCT00371345 study was open to patients with both ER\u00fe and/or HER2\u00fe disease. Interestingly, response rates (RR) of 16% were observed in the ER\u00fe cohort compared with 8% in the HER2\u00fe cohort, suggesting the potential activity of dasatinib in ER\u00fe tumors (44) . Other ongoing studies are evaluating dasatinib in hormone receptor-positive breast tumors in association with hormone therapy, like letrozole or fulvestrant (NCT00696072 and NCT00903006). In hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, an ongoing trial is evaluating an antibody against IGF-1R with dasatinib and fulvestrant (NCT00903006). Although, it is known that IGF-1R is highly expressed and activated in hormone receptor-positive tumors, no preclinical evidence supports this combination.Dasatinib could also be clinically useful for patients with tumors that overexpress HER2. In fact, preclinical evidence indicates that SRC associates to the intracellular region of HER2 and regulates the interaction between HER2 and HER3 (23) . Moreover, SRC activity has been linked to resistance to trastuzumab (24) . In this context, our data showed that concomitant administration of dasatinib and trastuzumab produced a synergistic effect in vitro and in animal models, in which the drug combination provoked disappearance of the tumors (25) . To explore the clinical relevance of these preclinical findings, a phase I and II study through the Spanish Breast Cancer Research Group Phase I Consortium (Net-GEICAM) testing weekly paclitaxel and trastuzumab, in addition to increasing doses of dasatinib (NCT01306942), is in progress. The phase II part of this study intends to identify potential signs of clinical activity.Other studies are combining dasatinib with standard-ofcare chemotherapy, such as capecitabine or paclitaxel, without selection of patients. Dasatinib and capecitabine have been tested in a phase I trial. Activity was limited, with only 13.5% of patients experiencing a partial response (PR; ref. 45 ). Dasatinib has also been explored in a phase I dose escalation trial in combination with weekly paclitaxel at 80 mg/m 2 . The dose selected for the phase II part was 120 mg (46) . In this study, 25% of patients experienced PR.Prostate cancer. In prostate cancer, SFK and FAK signaling are frequently overfunctional and have been linked to poor patient outcome, as well as resistance to antihormonal therapies (47) . Treatment of prostate cancer cells with dasatinib results in inhibition of SFK activity, which causes reduction of the tumor mass accompanied by inhibition of metastatic spreading to the lymph nodes or to the bone (48) . The latter effect may be related to the bone-protecting characteristic of dasatinib. In fact, in prostate cancer, tumored tibiae show a decrease in bone mineral density and trabecular bone volume (49, 50) , which can be counteracted by dasatinib (51) .Dasatinib alone (52) and in combination (Table 1 ) with standard-of-care chemotherapies is being evaluated in prostate cancer. In a phase I and II study, 16 patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer were treated with escalating doses of every-3-weeks docetaxel and daily dasatinib. A cohort of 30 patients received docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 and dasatinib 100 mg daily. A total of 42% of patients experienced a PR, with 68% having PR or stable disease for more than 18 weeks (53). A prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response was present in almost half of the patients. Pleural effusion was diagnosed in only 7% of patients. An ongoing phase III trial is currently randomizing patients to receive docetaxel alone or with dasatinib 100 mg daily (NCT00744497).Melanoma. Recent data suggest that the protein CUBdomain-containing protein 1 is highly expressed in melanoma and contributes to tumor metastasis through activation of SRC (54) . Ongoing studies are evaluating dasatinib monotherapy in melanoma (55) . Dasatinib, in addition to dacarbacine, is also being explored in this disease (56) . The most common toxicities were hematologic, especially thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. Of 49 patients treated in this trial, 4 (8.2%) had PR and 25 (51.0%) had prolonged stabilization of disease. The rate of clinical benefit was 59.2%.Dasatinib combinations in other tumors. Various preclinical studies support the use of dasatinib in CRC. A recent study has linked the expression of lysyl oxidase to metastatic spreading of CRC (57) . As this enzyme is regulated by SRC, the use of dasatinib in CRC could represent an interesting strategy to be tested. Also preclinical evidence links SRC with angiogenesis through an increased production of VEGF under hypoxic conditions (58) . In this context, some ongoing studies are evaluating dasatinib in combination with antiangiogenic agents. An ongoing study is testing the combination of bevacizumab and dasatinib with capecitabine and oxaliplatin in metastatic CRC (NCT00920868). Other studies are evaluating the addition of dasatinib to cetuximab-based regimens in colorectal and head and neck cancers (HNC; NCT00835679 and NCT00882583). In the latter, preclinical studies have indicated that the combination of SRC inhibitors with anti-EGFR agents exerts a synergistic antitumoral action (26) .In lung cancer, SRC activity is elevated, and EGFR and SFK cooperation in sustaining tumor growth has been reported (59) .

{"s2orc_id": 3572681, "title": "Insights into the structural and mechanistic basis of multifunctional S. cerevisiae Pif1p helicase", "abstract": "The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pif1 protein (ScPif1p) is the prototypical member of the Pif1 family of DNA helicases. ScPif1p is involved in the maintenance of mitochondrial, ribosomal and telomeric DNA and suppresses genome instability at G-quadruplex motifs. Here, we report the crystal structures of a truncated ScPif1p (ScPif1p237-780) in complex with different ssDNAs. Our results have revealed that a yeast-specific insertion domain protruding from the 2B domain folds as a bundle bearing an \u03b1-helix, \u03b116. The \u03b116 helix regulates the helicase activities of ScPif1p through interactions with the previously identified loop3. Furthermore, a biologically relevant dimeric structure has been identified, which can be further specifically stabilized by G-quadruplex DNA. Basing on structural analyses and mutational studies with DNA binding and unwinding assays, a potential G-quadruplex DNA binding site in ScPif1p monomers is suggested. Our results also show that ScPif1p uses the Q-motif to preferentially hydrolyze ATP, and a G-rich tract is preferentially recognized by more residues, consistent with previous biochemical observations. These findings provide a structural and mechanistic basis for understanding the multifunctional ScPif1p.", "citation_paragraph": "Previous studies have shown that ScPif1p had 5 folds higher binding ability for G-rich over non-G-rich ssDNA (15) . We further showed that G4/G-rich sequences may stimulate its duplex DNA unwinding activity (24) . To understand the structural basis for specific recognition and binding of G-rich sequences, we co-crystallized ScPif1p in complex with different types of ssDNA oligonucleotides including Poly(T 8 ) and two oligos bearing consecutive G bases at its 5 or 3 end. Pure G-rich sequences were not used as they are prone to form G4 structures. Attempts to co-crystallize ScPif1p with Poly(dA) or Poly(dC) were unsuccessful. Figure 2A (left panel) shows that the 6-base-T binding site traverses along a channel that runs across the top of domains 2A and 1A of ScPif1p in a 5 \u22123 direction, as previously observed in BsPif1-ssDNA complex (Figure 2A, right  panel) . Though the Poly(T 8 ) configurations and the interactions involved in DNA-protein binding in BsPif and ScPif1p are similar, some differences in the sugar-phosphate backbone binding and base recognition can be uncovered. First, while the only phosphate backbone is exclusively bound by residues from domains 1A and 2A in the BsPif1-ssDNA complex, both the phosphate and sugar groups are recognized by residues in domains 1A, 2A and 2B in the ScPif1p-ssDNA complex, in which N533 and N526 interact with the OH groups of phosphates 5 and 6 (Figure 2A and B) . In addition, the two highly conserved residues H705 and H303 seem to stack on the deoxyribose rings of nucleotides 2 and 4 ( Figure 2A and B) . Such interactions are absent in the BsPif1-ssDNA crystal structure (25) . Though it is not a stabilizing effect by -stacking, this interaction is mainly steric. Thus, these histidine residues may prevent RNA binding through its 2' hydroxyl group. These structural features may explain why ScPif1p preferentially loads ssDNA strand over ssRNA strand for translocation (17) .The above interpretation is supported by our equilibrium binding assays with the wild-type and a modified version of ScPif1p in which both H303 and H705 were replaced by glycine residues (H303G/H705G). While the wild-type protein displays a stronger binding ability towards Poly(T 12 ) over Poly(U 12 ) (K d,app DNA = 15.1 nM versus K d,app RNA = 162.9 nM), the H303G/H705G mutant has a completely inversed DNA/RNA binding property: it almost loses the DNA binding ability (too low to be determined precisely), but gains significant RNA binding activity (K d,app DNA = ND versus K d,app RNA = 70.5 nM) ( Figure 2D ). Second, while both the 5 -and 3 -end bases in the BsPif1-ssDNA complex are free of any contact with amino acids (25), the 5 -end base T1 in the ScPif1p-ssDNA complex is stacked by F723 to form hydrogen bonds between them (Figure 2A  and B) .A comparison between the solved structure of ScPif1p in complex with ssDNA bearing 3 consecutive G bases and that with Poly(dT) oligonucleotides (Figure 2A\u2212C) reveals that the residues implicated in interactions with the sugarphosphate backbones of both oligonucleotides are essentially the same ( Figure 2B) . Inspection of base recognition shows that the first three consecutive G bases from the 5 end of the G-rich oligonucleotide are specifically recognized by three additional residues (E724, K387 and K312) while only the first T1 base is recognized in the ScPif1p-Poly(T 8 ) complex (Figure 2A and B) . Importantly, while T2 and T3 in the ScPif1p-Poly(T 8 ) complex are free of contact with any residues, G1, G2 and G3 are recognized, respectively, by F723, E724/K387 and K312 in the ScPif1p-ssDNA complex. All these structural differences in nucleotide basespecific recognition may confer ScPif1p a binding preference for G-rich tracts over non-G-rich oligos (15) . We further characterized the ScPif1p-mediated DNA binding with fluorescently labeled Poly(T 12 ) and GR 12 under equilibrium conditions. The determined dissociation constant (K d,app ) with GR 12 (7.8 nM) is about two-fold lower than that with Poly(T 12 ) (15.1 nM) ( Figure 2E , left panel). Interestingly, in the presence of ATP\u2425 S, the K d,app value of GR 12 is reduced to 6.1 nM and that of Poly(T 12 ) is increased to 33.8 nM (Figure 2E, right panel) , indicating that ATP may simultaneously enhance G-rich-sequence and reduce Poly(T 12 ) bindings to ScPif1p, therefore achieving the selective binding of G-rich sequences. The above structural and functional characterizations provide a mechanistic understanding of the specific binding for, and the DNA unwinding-stimulation by G-rich sequences (23, 24) .", "citance": "Previous studies have shown that ScPif1p had 5 folds higher binding ability for G-rich over non-G-rich ssDNA (15) .", "claims": [{"text": "ScPif1p has higher binding ability to G-rich ssDNA than to non-G-rich ssDNA.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "ScPif1p has reduced binding ability to G-rich ssDNA compared to non-G-rich ssDNA.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}
{"s2orc_id": 380862, "title": "Vascular endothelium-derived factors and arterial stiffness in strength- and endurance-trained men.", "abstract": "Arterial stiffness is higher in strength-trained humans and lower in endurance-trained humans. However, the mechanisms underlying these different adaptations are unclear. Vascular endothelium-derived factors, such as endothelin-1 (ET-1) and nitric oxide (NO), play an important role in the regulation of vascular tonus. We hypothesized that endogenous ET-1 and NO participate in the adaptation of arterial stiffness in different types of exercise training. The purpose of this study was to investigate plasma ET-1 and NO concentrations and arterial stiffness in strength- and endurance-trained men. Young strength-trained athletes (SA; n = 11), endurance-trained athletes (EA; n = 12), and sedentary control men (C; n = 12) participated in this study. Maximal handgrip strength in SA and maximal oxygen uptake in EA were markedly greater than in C. Aortic pulse-wave velocity, which is an established index of arterial stiffness, was higher in SA and lower in EA than in C. Additionally, we measured systemic arterial compliance (SAC) using carotid artery applanation tonometry and Doppler echocardiography, because arterial stiffness is a primary determinant of the compliance. SAC was lower in SA and higher in EA compared with that in C. Plasma ET-1 concentrations were higher in SA compared with C and EA. We did not find significant differences in plasma NO concentrations (measured as the stable end product of NO, i.e., nitrite/nitrate). The relationships of plasma ET-1 concentrations to aortic pulse-wave velocity and SAC were linear. These results suggest that differences in endogenous ET-1 may partly participate in the mechanism underlying different adaptations of arterial stiffness in strength- and endurance-trained men.", "citation_paragraph": "It is now well established that increased vascular tonus and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells increase arterial stiffness and consequently decrease arterial compliance (28, 33) . ET-1 has potent vasoconstrictor activity and potent proliferative effects on vascular smooth muscle cells (22) . Furthermore, it has been reported that arterial stiffness was increased by intra-arterial infusion of ET-1 and decreased by the administration of ET-1 receptor antagonist (20, 34) . These findings suggest that endogenous ET-1 participates in the regulation of arterial stiffness. In this study, we found that aortic PWV was higher and SAC was lower in strength-trained men and that aortic PWV was lower and SAC was higher in endurance-trained men. We have also demonstrated that plasma concentrations of ET-1 were significantly higher in strength-trained men than in endurance-trained or sedentary men. The relationships of aortic PWV and SAC to plasma ET-1 concentrations were linear. Furthermore, stepwise regression analysis and partial regression analysis revealed that the associations of plasma ET-1 concentrations with aortic PWV and SAC were independent of blood pressure. These results suggest that differences in plasma ET-1 levels may be involved in the mechanism underlying adaptations of arterial stiffness to different types of exercise training.Previous studies have reported the effects of ET-1 infusion, endothelin receptor blockade, and inhibition of NO production on arterial stiffness (11, 20, 30, 34, 35) . Recently, we have demonstrated that the inhibition of NO production appeared to have no effect on the acute decrease in middle-sized arterial stiffness with low-intensity, short-duration exercise, although its decrease was induced mainly by regional factors (30). Wilkinson et al. (35) have reported that PWV increased by only 3% during the intra-arterial infusion of NO synthase inhibitor (10 M/min). In the same experimental setting, they have also demonstrated that the administration of ET-1 (10 pM/min) increased PWV by 12% and that treatment with endothelin A receptor antagonist (40 nM/min) reduced PWV by 12% (20) . These findings suggest that ET-1 may be a more important factor to the regulation of arterial stiffness than NO (20) . In the present study, we showed the increased arterial stiffness and plasma ET-1 concentrations in strength-trained men. On the basis of the results from past studies plus the present results, we propose that the higher ET-1 production in strength-trained men increases arterial stiffness.The mechanism underlying the increased plasma ET-1 concentrations in strength-trained men remains unclear. It has been reported that arterial blood pressure increases to 340/240 mmHg during bouts of high-intensity strength exercise (15) . After such high-intensity strength exercise, arterial stiffness increases acutely for at least 30 min, although arterial blood pressure rapidly returns to the preexercise basal level (6) . Since ET-1 has potent vasoconstrictor and pressor activities (22) , it is possible that endogenous Fig. 4 . Plasma nitrite/nitrate (NOx, the stable end product of nitric oxide) concentrations in SA, EA, and C groups. Data are expressed as means \u03ee SE. ET-1 participates in increased blood pressure and arterial stiffness during and following high-intensity strength exercise. The intermittent repetition of high-intensity strength exercises (i.e., strength training) might cause an elevation of basal plasma ET-1 levels in strength-trained men.The conclusions drawn in this study come from examination of plasma ET-1 concentrations. It is generally accepted that ET-1 acts predominantly in autocrine and paracrine manners, and the secretion of ET-1 by endothelial cells is polarized toward the underlying vascular smooth muscle (22) . Consequently, plasma levels are largely the result of spillover from the vascular endothelium into the bloodstream. Since only \u03f320% of generated ET-1 is secreted intraluminally (36) , plasma ET-1 concentrations are very low. However, the plasma levels of ET-1 are associated with disease severity (4) and increase with aging even in normal subjects (18, 23) . Therefore, the alteration of plasma ET-1 concentrations may have important clinical significance in physiology and/or pathophysiology. Taken together, these data suggest that the differences in plasma ET-1 concentration may be involved in the different adaptations of arterial stiffness to strength training and endurance training.Increased arterial stiffness implicates in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease (2, 12) . In this study, arterial stiffness was higher and arterial compliance was lower in strengthtrained men compared with endurance-trained men and sedentary control men. Additionally, blood pressure was also higher in the strength-trained men. It is possible that the increased arterial stiffness is one of the physiological adaptations to the intense increase in blood pressure during strengthening exercise. However, at resting conditions, it is unlikely that the increased arterial stiffness and blood pressure are beneficial to vessels and heart. The Bogalusa Heart Study has reported that intima-media thickness of carotid arteries in healthy young adults was associated with the cumulative burden of cardiovascular risk factors since childhood (13) . The Young Finns Study has identified an association between school-age risk variables and intima-media thickness of carotid arteries at 36 yr, even after adjustment for contemporaneous risk variables (27) . Recently, Miyachi et al. (21) have reported that the decreased arterial compliance caused by strength training dissipated to the basal level (the level before strength training) 2 mo after cessation of strength training in young healthy men. Furthermore, we have reported that the decreased plasma ET-1 levels observed in endurance training returned to the basal level 2 mo after cessation of training (16) . Therefore, we believe that increased arterial stiffness and plasma ET-1 concentrations in strength-trained men are physiological adaptations to their competitive sports.The present investigation has the following study limitations. First, blood pressure in strength-trained men was higher than in endurance-trained men and sedentary peers. This might influence the main results in this study. However, in this study, we performed statistical analysis in consideration of the differences in blood pressure. ANCOVA revealed that the effects of exercise training on arterial stiffness were statistically independent of blood pressure. Additionally, stepwise regression analysis was used to determine the blood pressure-independent association between plasma ET-1 concentrations and arterial stiffness. Although the sample size in the present study may not be enough to use this method, the results of partial correlation analysis did not conflict with that of stepwise regression analysis. The conceivable next steps would be to compare arterial stiffness and plasma ET-1 concentrations between blood pressure-matched groups to determine the independent role of ET-1 on arterial stiffness. Second, it is difficult to identify which arteries determine the value of SAC. Stergiopulos et al. (29) has reported that the aortic occlusion at the aortic trifurcation did not change SAC but that the occlusion at the level of proximal descending aorta induced a 40% reduction of SAC. Thus it is considered that compliance of the descending aorta at least participates in SAC and that ascending aorta and/or the ramified arteries such as carotid artery would also be implicated in SAC.In conclusion, the present study has demonstrated that plasma concentrations of ET-1 were significantly higher in strength-trained men than in endurance-trained or sedentary men. We have also demonstrated that arterial stiffness was increased in strength-trained men and reduced in endurancetrained men. The association of arterial stiffness with plasma ET-1 concentrations was linear and statistically independent of blood pressure. We propose that differences in plasma concentrations of ET-1 may partly participate in the mechanism underlying different adaptations of arterial stiffness to strength and endurance training.", "citance": "The Young Finns Study has identified an association between school-age risk variables and intima-media thickness of carotid arteries at 36 yr, even after adjustment for contemporaneous risk variables (27) .", "claims": [{"text": "School-age risk variables are associated with intima-media thickness of carotid arteries at 36 years of age.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Boar seminal plasma exosomes had typical nano-structure morphology as measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and molecular markers such as AWN, CD9 and CD63 by western blot analysis. The effect on sperm parameters of adding different ratio of boar seminal plasma exosomes to boar sperm preparations was analyzed. Compared to the diluent without exosomes, the diluent with four times or sixteen times exosomes compared to original semen had higher sperm motility, prolonged effective survival time, improved sperm plasma membrane integrity (p < 0.05), increased total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) activity and decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) content. The diluent containing four times concentration of exosomes compared to original semen was determined to inhibit premature capacitation, but not to influence capacitation induced in vitro. Inhibition of premature capacitation is likely related to the concentration of exosomes which had been demonstrated to transfer proteins including AWN and PSP-1 into sperm. In addition, using fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy analysis, it was demonstrated that exosomes in diluent were directly binding to the membrane of sperm head which could improve sperm plasma membrane integrity.", "citation_paragraph": "In order to become fully fertile after leaving testis, mammalian sperm must undergo morphological and functional changes during transit through epididymis and other accessory sex organs. Specifically, proteins and lipids on the sperm membrane are subtly modified by secretions of the male genital tract [1] . Upon ejaculation, spermatozoa are mixed with another set of surface re-modeling components derived from the accessory sex glands. Secretions from the male genital tract can influence the capacitation of sperm during their transit along the female genital tract [2] . Molecules on the surface of spermatozoa and in seminal plasma act in concert to stimulate or inhibit the onset and progression of the capacitation process [3, 4] . It is thought that early capacitation-related events are accompanied with the loss, modification and redistribution of molecules on the sperm surface during sperm storage in vitro [5, 6] . The decapacitation factors on sperm membranes and in seminal plasma are believed to stabilize the sperm membrane and keep sperm in a non-capacitated state, until these factors are removed during capacitation. It has also been observed that addition of ram or boar seminal plasma to sperm preparations improved viability and motility and reduced capacitation-like changes during sperm storage. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the components of boar seminal plasma that help to maintain sperm function during sperm storage in vitro.Seminal plasma vesicles, which are characterized by high enrichment of cholesterol and sphingomyelin content, and a complex protein composition, have been isolated from the seminal plasma of human (namely prostasomes) [2, 7] , rat [8] , ram [9] , and boar [10] . It Research Paper: Pathology has been hypothesized that mammallian seminal plasma vesicles (perhaps including exosomes) can mediate decapacitation activity using several possible mechanism, such as inhibiting the capacitation-dependent cholesterol efflux, fluidity increase in sperm apical membranes, delivery of Ca 2+ signaling molecule, and control of the acrosome reaction [11] [12] [13] .Seminal plasma exosomes are membrane vesicles ranging from 30 to 120-nm diameter in size that are produced by organs in the male genital tracts including epididymis and prostate [10, 14, 15] . In boar, seminal plasma exosomes could inhibit the capacitation-dependent cholesterol efflux and mediate degradation of the 14-kD phosphorylated polypeptide of capacitated sperm [10, 12] . Several previous studies have demonstrated that seminal plasma exosomes may play an important role in maintaining the sperm function during in vitro preservation. However, the effect of boar seminal plasma exosomes as an additive to maintain semen quality during preservation at low temperature has not been reported.

{"s2orc_id": 21333877, "title": "Maternal obesity programs increased leptin gene expression in rat male offspring via epigenetic modifications in a depot-specific manner", "abstract": "OBJECTIVE According to the Developmental Origin of Health and Disease (DOHaD) concept, maternal obesity and accelerated growth in neonates predispose offspring to white adipose tissue (WAT) accumulation. In rodents, adipogenesis mainly develops during lactation. The mechanisms underlying the phenomenon known as developmental programming remain elusive. We previously reported that adult rat offspring from high-fat diet-fed dams (called HF) exhibited hypertrophic adipocyte, hyperleptinemia and increased leptin mRNA levels in a depot-specific manner. We hypothesized that leptin upregulation occurs via epigenetic malprogramming, which takes place early during development of WAT.   METHODS As a first step, we identified in silico two potential enhancers located upstream and downstream of the leptin transcription start site that exhibit strong dynamic epigenomic remodeling during adipocyte differentiation. We then focused on epigenetic modifications (methylation, hydroxymethylation, and histone modifications) of the promoter and the two potential enhancers regulating leptin gene expression in perirenal (pWAT) and inguinal (iWAT) fat pads of HF offspring during lactation (postnatal days 12 (PND12) and 21 (PND21)) and in adulthood.   RESULTS PND12 is an active period for epigenomic remodeling in both deposits especially in the upstream enhancer, consistent with leptin gene induction during adipogenesis. Unlike iWAT, some of these epigenetic marks were still observable in pWAT of weaned HF offspring. Retained marks were only visible in pWAT of 9-month-old HF rats that showed a persistent \"expandable\" phenotype.   CONCLUSIONS Consistent with the DOHaD hypothesis, persistent epigenetic remodeling occurs at regulatory regions especially within intergenic sequences, linked to higher leptin gene expression in adult HF offspring in a depot-specific manner.", "citation_paragraph": "In the current study, we showed that persistent increased leptin mRNA levels in HF offspring's WAT may occur via epigenetic mechanisms which take place during the early postnatal period. In WAT, increased leptin mRNA levels are correlated with hypertrophy [39] and modified methylation of the leptin promoter. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and the sequences regulating leptin gene expression remain unclear. In addition to the promoter sequence, additional regions that are not yet determined are expected to regulate leptin gene expression [25,29e34] . As a first step, we identified in silico two potential enhancers (i.e. upstream and downstream) involved in the transcriptional regulation of the leptin gene that exhibit strong dynamic epigenomic remodeling (i.e., increased H3K4me1/H3K27ac, DNA hydroxymethylation and decreased DNA methylation) during adipocyte differentiation [16, 20] . We previously showed that HF offspring had a normal birthweight and, then, exhibited a rapid weight gain during lactation, a key period of adipose tissue development [4, 27] . The accelerated postnatal growth in offspring is frequently associated with persisting adiposity throughout life [40] . HF offspring showed elevated plasma leptin concentration throughout life. Although plasma leptin is considered as a function of adipose tissue mass, plasma leptin levels and leptin gene expression are not only a result of greater adiposity [41] . In addition, Figure 4 : The upstream enhancer displays persistent depletion in 5 mC and H3K9me3 and enrichment in 5hmc and H3K4me1/H3K27ac in pWAT of HF offspring. Epigenetic modifications of four CpG indicated in gray (A) and located in the upstream enhancer at \u00c042812 bp (B), \u00c042826 bp (C), \u00c042833 bp (D) and \u00c042835 bp (E) of the transcription start site were assessed in male C and HF offspring in two fat pads (pWAT and iWAT) at PND12, PND21, and 9 months. To discriminate the nature of DNA modifications, DNA extracted from both depots was immunoprecipitated with antibodies against DNA methylation (MeDIP) (F), DNA hydroxymethylation (HMeDIP) (G) and subject to qPCR using primers of targeted regions. Histone modifications were measured after chromatin immunoprecipitation with antibodies against H3K4me1 (H), H3K27ac (active mark) (I) or H3K9me3 (inactive mark) (J) and qPCR using primers of the targeted regions. Immunoprecipitation with normal rabbit IgG was used as a negative control. All data are presented as means AE SEM. Data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc test. * Effect of maternal obesity (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001). n \u00bc 4e 6 per group. further experiments are needed to determine the extent to which maternal obesity may affect central and peripheral leptin sensitivity in HF offspring. Here, we found that among iWAT and pWAT, only the latter showed a persistent \"expandable\" (i.e. hypertrophy, hyperplasia) phenotype with elevated leptin mRNA levels in adulthood. Contrary to subcutaneous WAT, increased visceral WAT mass is strongly associated with cardiometabolic risk and mortality [10, 28] . The varying outcomes may reflect differences in postnatal programming. One possible reason is the heterogeneity of the adipose lineage between fat depots in terms of spatiotemporal adipogenic potential, gene expression profile, growth rate, and biological properties [9, 28] . Numerous studies demonstrated that the ability of adipose precursors to differentiate during adipogenesis is dependent on the anatomic location and the local microenvironment, leading to the concept of depot-specific adipogenesis [13, 42] . Thus, subcutaneous depots have increased rates of adipose turnover and new adipocyte formation compared to other visceral fat mass [43, 44] . An emerging hypothesis is that anatomically distinct WAT depots (i.e., visceral and subcutaneous fat pads) likely represent distinct \"mini-organs\" [10, 28] . During lactation, adipocyte stem cells are plastic and highly sensitive to maternal factors [8] . Thus, maternal obesity and modified milk composition may influence offspring's energy and hormonal status [45, 46] , thereby modifying the expression of the leptin gene via epigenetic changes in a depot-specific manner. In rodents, few studies have examined depotand sex-specific consequences of maternal obesity in offspring's WAT and there is little agreement among them [4] . We previously demonstrated that maternal obesity programs visceral depots only in HF male offspring [27] . Given the sex-specific nature of fat depots and the sexual dimorphism in developmental programming mechanisms [47] , further experiments are needed to determine whether iWAT is a target of programming in HF female offspring. We then decided to assess the kinetic of epigenetic changes within three regulatory regions linked to increased leptin gene expression during development of offspring's WAT and in adulthood. PND12 is an active period for epigenomic remodeling (i.e., lower DNA methylation and inactive histone modification H3K9me3 and higher DNA hydroxymethylation and active histone modification H3K4me1/H3K27ac) in both fat pads, especially in the upstream enhancer, consistent with leptin gene induction during adipogenesis. Unlike iWAT, some of these epigenetic marks were still observable in pWAT of weaned HF offspring. The global reduction of marks between lactation and weaning may reflect modified offspring's food intake from milk to solid diet. Retained active marks (i.e., the promoter and the upstream enhancer) were only observed in pWAT of adult HF offspring and were correlated with persistent increased leptin gene expression, hypertrophy and higher weight. Although additional studies are required to assess the functionality of the upstream enhancer, we speculate that this region is more active in pWAT of HF offspring resulting in longterm effects on leptin gene expression. Consistent with these findings, changes in cytosine modifications during developmental programming take place not only at promoters but also at additional regulatory regions within intergenic sequences [38] . Both enhancers display at least 80% sequence homology between mouse and rat. These two regions are partially conserved between rat and human with 68.8% sequence homology for the upstream enhancer and 56.4% sequence homology for the downstream enhancer. Recent studies comparing key selected mammals showed that enhancers are far less evolutionarily stable than are promoters across species and that sequence conservation is a rather poor predictor of functionality [48] . However, the fact that, unlike the downstream enhancer, the upstream enhancer displays similar epigenomic remodeling (enrichment in H3K27ac and H3K4me1/2/3) during human adipose stem cells differentiation suggests that the upstream enhancer is also functional and active in human adipocytes [20] . We also showed that the global 5 mC level of leptin regulatory sequences in 9-month-old HF offspring was lower than 12-day-old HF neonates, suggesting that a demethylation process occurs during development of WAT. 5 mC is the only known modification that targets the DNA itself and is usually associated with gene silencing [14] . In most cases, the extent of 5 mC of a promoter is inversely correlated with the activity of the respective gene. Generally, 5 mC physically blocks the binding of a transcription factor to its target, leading to gene silencing. The role of 5 hmC in the regulation of transcriptional activity is still not well understood. 5 hmC can be considered as a demethylation intermediate or as a stable epigenetic mark that is enriched in active genomic region [49] . The enrichment of H3K4me1/H3K27ac and the reduction of H3K9me3 are characteristic of enhancer and promoter activation [20] . These processes take place on a large scale during adipocyte differentiation [20, 50] . A potential limitation of our approach lies in the fact that we performed DNA analysis using whole WAT, which may contain different cell type abundance depending on the stage of development. However, gene expression profiling using several endothelial, hematopoietic, and immune cell markers suggests that the composition of HF offspring's WAT is not modified regardless of the stage of development. Besides epigenetic programming mechanisms, alterations of hormone and metabolic environment during fetal and neonatal development can contribute to persistent deregulation of energy homeostasis in progeny. Although underlying mechanisms remain unclear, increased hormone levels in the fetal compartment or neonate may result in long-term fat expansion with permanent changes in mRNA and plasma hormone levels in adulthood. Over the past few decades, the adipocytokine leptin has been considered as the main programming factor of the hypothalamus adipose-axis that plays a pivotal role in the body weight set point [41] . Several studies support the notion that fat expansion with persistent changes in leptin expression and sensitivity in HF offspring may be partly due to increased neonatal leptin levels, whose origin remains open to debate (i.e. breast milk, developing WAT). First, perinatal leptin administration and amplified postnatal leptin surge have long-term detrimental effects resulting in leptin resistance, increased leptin gene expression, and higher adiposity in adulthood [46, 51] . Second, leptin displays marked neurotrophic effects on hypothalamic neuronal development [52] . Third, leptin directly activates adipogenesis by promoting differentiation of preadipocytes [53] , whereas it shows antilipogenic effects on mature adipocytes [54] .", "citance": "Recent studies comparing key selected mammals showed that enhancers are far less evolutionarily stable than are promoters across species and that sequence conservation is a rather poor predictor of functionality [48] .", "claims": [{"text": "Sequence conservation in gene regulatory regions between species is a high-accuracy predictor of conserved functionality.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Sequence conservation in gene regulatory regions between species is a poor predictor of conserved functionality.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Recent studies suggested that statins, besides lowering cholesterol, may protect vessels by enhancing the activity of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). In the present study, we investigated if simvastatin increases eNOS activity through its phosphorylation in 293 cells (293-eNOS) with stable expression of eNOS. The results showed that incubation of 293-eNOS cells with simvastatin (10 \u03bcm/L) for 2 h significantly increased in the activity of eNOS as shown by the conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline (2889.70\u00b1201.51 versus 5630.18\u00b1218.75 pmol/min \u00b7 mg proteins) (P<0.01). Western blotting revealed that simvastatin increased phosphorylation of eNOS at 1177 (ser) and also 495 (thr) but did not affect the overall expression of eNOS or inducible NOS. Further study found that simvastatin raised phosphorylation levels of Akt and AMPK, and such effect could be antagonized by Akt inhibitor or AMPK inhibitor. These results suggest that simvastatin could stimulate the activity of eNOS via its phosphorylation by Akt and AMPK, which provides a new mechanism, other than lipid-lowering effect, for the cardiovascular protection of statins.", "citation_paragraph": "In the present study, we established stable transfectants sites, but simvastatin-enhanced phosphorylation at eNOS-1177 (ser) was about 2-times that at eNOS-495. The cell signaling study showed that simvastatin remarkably increased phosphorylation of Akt and AMPK, but not MAPK1/2, and Akt and AMPK inhibitors, respectively, abolished the simvastatin-enhanced eNOS activity and phosphorylation, suggesting that the intracellular signaling mechanisms by which simvastatin enhanced eNOS phosphorylation and consequently increased eNOS activity involved the activation of Akt/PKB and AMPK pathways rather than MAPK.Previous studies have demonstrated that statins treatment increased eNOS activity of cultured endothelial cells [4, 18] , and this effect was associated with prolonged half-time of eNOS mRNA and its increased expression [18] . However, in the endothelial cells, it is difficult to directly demonstrate post-translational regulation of eNOS although Kureishi et al demonstrated that simvastatin activated Akt in cultured endothelial cells [14] . The 293 cells with stable eNOS expression provide a cell model for the research of post-transcriptional regulation of eNOS and our study also showed that simvastatin treatment did not affect the expression of eNOS.In the cells with stable eNOS expression, simvastatin activates eNOS, increases the conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline without increasing the eNOS expression and changing iNOS expression. Recent studies showed that the phosphorylation of eNOS-1177 (ser) increased activity of eNOS [24] , while the phosphorylation of eNOS-495 (thr) reduced activity of the enzyme [25] . In this study, simvastatin significantly raised phosphorylation levels at eNOS-1177 (ser) and eNOS-495 (thr), but the action was much stronger at eNOS-1177 (ser) than at eNOS-495 (thr) (more than 2-fold). These results indicated that simvastatin may enhance eNOS activity by stimulating phosphorylation of eNOS-1177 (ser) site.Our study also demonstrated that simvastatin remarkably activated Akt/PKB. Treatment with Akt inhibitor blocked simvastatin-activated phosphorylation of Akt, and simultaneously completely abolished eNOS phosphorylation and simvastatin-increased eNOS activity. It was also found that simvastatin enhanced AMPK phosphorylation, and AMPK inhibitor blocked simvastatin-induced eNOS phosphorylation and its activity. These results provide further evidence that simvastatin can activate eNOS phosphorylation via Akt/PKB and AMPK and increase its activity although the exact mechanism of Akt/PKB and AMPK activation is not clear.In summary, the present study demonstrated that simvastatin induces a significant increase in activity of eNOS and eNOS phosphorylation level without changing eNOS and iNOS expression, and these beneficial effects, i.e., eNOS phosphorylation at 1177 (ser) and resultant elevation in eNOS activity, may be mediated via activation of Akt and AMPK signaling pathways.", "citance": "However, in the endothelial cells, it is difficult to directly demonstrate post-translational regulation of eNOS although Kureishi et al demonstrated that simvastatin activated Akt in cultured endothelial cells [14] .", "claims": [{"text": "Simvastatin activates protein kinase B in cultured endothelial cells.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

The budding yeast RecQ helicase Sgs1 has been implicated in several key processes during the repair of DNA damage by homologous recombination as part of the STR complex (Sgs1-Top3-Rmi1). Limited information on how is Sgs1 recruited and regulated at sites of damage is available. Recently, we and others have uncover a direct link between the Smc5/6 complex and Sgs1. Most roles of Sgs1 during recombination, including DNA end resection, Holiday junction dissolution, and crossover suppression, are regulated through Mms21-dependent SUMOylation. Smc5/6 first acts as a recruiting platform for STR and then SUMOylates STR components to regulate their function. Importantly, the assembly of STR is totally independent of Smc5/6. Here, we provide a brief overview of STR regulation by Smc5/6.", "citation_paragraph": "In recent years, many studies showed that the inactivation of the Smc5/6 complex and sgs1\u2206 cells display similar phenotypes when exposed to DNA damage. They both accumulate recombination-dependent HJs upon replication stress (Ampatzidou et al. 2006; Bermudez-Lopez et al. 2010; Branzei et al. 2006; Liberi et al. 2005; Mankouri et al. 2009; Sollier et al. 2009 ), and show increased crossover frequencies between sister chromatids (de et al. 2006; Ira et al. 2003; Potts et al. 2006) , indicating that their function is probably related. Interestingly, these defects are also seen when the SUMO ligase activity of the Smc5/6 complex is abrogated by the deletion of the C-terminal Siz/ PIAS domain of Mms21/Nse2, a SUMO E3 ligase subunit of Smc5/6 [(Bermudez-Lopez et al. 2010) and Fig. 1] .Using a proteomic screen to look for substrates of Mms21, we identified several subunits within the Smc5/6 complex (Smc5, Smc6, Mms21, Nse3, and Nse4) and two subunits of the STR complex (Sgs1 and Top3) (Bermudez-Lopez et al. 2016) . Although Sgs1 had been already described to be SUMOylated in response to DNA damage (Branzei et al. 2006; Lu et al. 2010) , neither the SUMO ligase responsible for the modification nor the functional consequences were known. We and others recently demonstrated that the STR complex is able to recognise SUMOylated Smc5/6 complexes at sites of DNA damage (Bermudez-Lopez et al. 2016; Bonner et al. 2016) . We proposed that Smc5/6 is attracted to DNA structures that require STR-dependent repair and that upon Smc5/6 engagement, an ATP-dependent remodelling of Smc5/6 drives the activation of the SUMO E3 ligase Mms21, previously demonstrated in (Bermudez-Lopez et al. 2015) . As a consequence, SUMOylation of Smc5/6 subunits located at sites of DNA damage would ensue. Crucially, Sgs1 is able to specifically recognise SUMOylated Smc5/6 through two SUMO Interacting Motifs (SIMs) and through this be recruited to these damaged sites (Bermudez-Lopez et al. 2016) . Once recruited, STR subunits are SUMOylated in the hands of Mms21, and this results in the activation of the recombinogenic function. Preventing either the recruitment of STR or its SUMOylation causes multiple recombination phenotypes, including decreased DNA end resection, accumulation of recombination-dependent structures at damaged forks and increases in crossover formation during DSB repair (Bermudez-Lopez et al. 2016) . Taken together, a two-step role for Smc5/6 in recruiting and activating Sgs1 through SUMOylation seems to fine-tune STR complex functions during recombinational repair.", "citance": "We proposed that Smc5/6 is attracted to DNA structures that require STR-dependent repair and that upon Smc5/6 engagement, an ATP-dependent remodelling of Smc5/6 drives the activation of the SUMO E3 ligase Mms21, previously demonstrated in (Bermudez-Lopez et al. 2015) .", "claims": [{"text": "Smc5/6 engagment drives the activation of SUMO E3 ligase Mms21 by ATP-dependent remolding.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Smc5/6 engagment halts the activation of SUMO E3 ligase Mms21 by ATP-dependent remolding.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Smc5/6 is attracted to DNA structures that require STR-dependent repair.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Many cancer survivors face lifetime risks associated with their cancer therapy, with a significant proportion at risk for serious morbidity and premature mortality.

This article summarizes economic burden of cancer survivors, main post-treatment health problems including secondary primary cancer and comorbidities, health behaviors such as smoking, exercise and physical activity, nutrition, and psychosocial problems. Faced with various health and psychosocial problems specific to this population, several healthcare and policy models are being suggested to address these issues, including 'shared care model' and 'integrative supportive care service delivery system for cancer survivors'.

{"s2orc_id": 504840, "title": "Development of a recombinant antibody to target peptides and proteins to sialoadhesin-expressing macrophages", "abstract": "BACKGROUND Sialoadhesin (Sn)-expressing monocytes/macrophages have been associated with several diseases like inflammatory and autoimmune disorders as well as viral infections, and they also appear to play a role in the initiation of an adaptive immune response. This makes Sn-expressing cells not only attractive targets for cell-directed therapies, but also an appealing target for vaccination. Furthermore, since Sn was shown to be an endocytic receptor, the conjugation of effector molecules to an Sn-specific ligand should allow intracellular delivery of these conjugates. Previously, we developed functional Sn-specific immunoconjugates that were generated via chemical coupling. Although successful, the system requires significant optimization for each immunoconjugate to be made. To generate a more flexible and controlled system, we developed a recombinant antibody vector allowing the creation of genetic antibody fusion constructs. This paper reports on the characterization of the recombinant antibody and the evaluation of its use for Sn-directed targeting.   RESULTS The variable domains of the porcine Sn-specific monoclonal antibody 41D3 were sequenced and cloned in frame with a mouse IgG1 backbone. Transfection of HEK293T cells with the resulting plasmid led to the secretion of fully assembled IgG into the culture medium. This recombinant antibody rec41D3 was shown to specifically bind to porcine Sn with a comparable affinity as the native monoclonal antibody. In addition, rec41D3 also induced Sn endocytosis in primary macrophages and resided for prolonged times in early/late endosomes. To allow the generation of antibody fusion constructs, a multiple cloning site was introduced at the C-terminus of the heavy chain. Two fusion constructs were generated, one containing a V5 peptide tag and one containing an eGFP molecule. Both constructs were shown to be efficiently produced in HEK293T cells and easily purified using standard protein G chromatography. In addition, both V5 and eGFP were shown to be co-internalized together with rec41D3 into Sn-expressing primary macrophages.   CONCLUSIONS A recombinant antibody allowing targeted delivery of peptides and proteins to Sn-expressing macrophages was developed. Production and purification of antibody fusion constructs was possible without major optimization and with batch to batch consistency, confirming the development of a versatile antibody vector to evaluate Sn-directed targeting strategies in a porcine animal model.", "citation_paragraph": "Monoclonal antibodies and derivatives are currently the fastest growing class of therapeutic molecules [26] . Their inherent promise to minimize side effects by selectively targeting specific target cells has fuelled their development, leading to several FDA-approved antibody therapeutics so far and many more in the pipeline. Although unmodified mAbs proved their worth, the conjugation of effector molecules (like toxins, drugs, radionuclides,. . .) to mAbs broadened their therapeutic potential, especially in the domain of cancer therapeutics. Besides cancer, other diseases could also benefit from antibody-directed therapies, the only prerequisite being the identification of a receptor exclusively expressed on those immune cells involved in the induction of pathology. In this respect, sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (siglecs) are compelling candidates for therapy, as they display very restricted expression patterns on subsets of immune cells and may regulate immune cell functions. Furthermore, siglecs are endocytic receptors allowing therapeutic agents conjugated to a mAb to be carried efficiently into the cell [27, 28] . Sialoadhesin or Siglec-1 is expressed on cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage, notably on subsets of resident tissue macrophages and inflammatory monocytes/ macrophages [15, 27] . A recent report describes the expression of Sn on human mature DCs treated with LPS in vitro [29] , suggesting that Sn may be present on mature DCs during inflammation in vivo as well. Not only have Sn + monocytes/macrophages been described in several diseases like inflammatory and autoimmune disorders as well as viral infections, they also appear to play a role in the initiation of an adaptive immune response as recently shown by different independent research groups and nicely reviewed by Martinez-Pomares and Gordon [1] . Together, this makes these Sn + cells not only attractive targets for cell-directed therapies, but also an appealing target for vaccination. In our previous study, we developed immunoconjugates by the chemical linkage of the model antigen HSA or a toxin to the pSn-specific mAb 41D3 [10] . Although these immunoconjugates proved efficient for boosting immune responses and killing pSnexpressing cells respectively, the chemical linkage of the cargo to a targeting antibody has many disadvantages. First of all, chemical coupling procedures rely on the presence and distribution of reactive groups, like e.g. primary amines on lysine residues, that can be located in or near the antigen-binding region, which upon coupling might result in partial or complete loss of the antibody's affinity for the target antigen. Secondly, because of the large number of reactive groups present in antibody molecules, a typical distribution can be observed of zero to eight molecules per antibody [30, 31] , resulting in high variation of the final conjugate. This variation is unwanted, as it may lead to a heterogeneous mixture of components with distinct affinities, stabilities, pharmacokinetics, efficacies, and safety profiles [21] . Moreover, chemical coupling implies that both antibody and cargo to be linked are independently produced and purified, which represents a significant challenge, especially when the cargo is also a biologic. To circumvent these problems, we opted to generate a recombinant form of the pSn-specific mAb 41D3. As shown in this study, this recombinant antibody displays a comparable affinity for pSn compared to the native mAb. In addition, the recombinant mAb also induces pSn endocytosis in primary macrophages, a feature important to allow functionality of antibody-cargo constructs. As protein sequences are attached to the Cterminus of the antibody's heavy chain, they are less likely to hinder antigen binding by the variable immunoglobulin domains. In addition, each heavy chain will contain only one cargo fused to the C-terminal end. This will result in an antibody with 2 cargos in a defined position and a high intra and inter batch consistency. Furthermore, we could purify the antibody-cargo fusion proteins using standard protein G chromatography, which represents a major advantage compared to chemical coupling in which purification is needed for both cargo and antibody before, as well as after chemical conjugation.In this study we managed to make genetic fusion constructs of a peptide or a protein linked to our recombinant mAb. Obviously, the recombinant antibody vector does not allow to make genetic fusion constructs with chemical compounds. For vaccination strategies however, this limitation is not expected to pose any problems, as most antigens used in vaccines are protein based. One challenge however would be to ensure correct folding of the antigen upon genetic fusion to the antibody and to maintain this fold during purification procedures. Similarly, immunotoxins can be made using the Sn targeting vector. Although the production of immunotoxins in eukaryotic cells has been limited due to potential toxicity to the producing cells, several independent research groups have reported on the successful production of immunotoxins in mammalian cell lines, including HEK293T [32] [33] [34] . In case a specific application would require the chemical linkage to an antibody, e.g. when vaccines are based on glyco-epitopes, a recombinant mAb has some major advantages. It allows addition of specific amino acid modifications to the antibody, which will result in site-specific incorporation of drug molecules through chemical linkage yielding batch to batch consistency of antibody-drug conjugates. Examples of such already implemented modifications are the THIOMAB TM technology of Genentech Inc [35] or the methodology of Axup et al. [21] .As our future plans include the use of the developed recombinant antibody to target antigens towards pSnexpressing macrophages in vivo, one might be concerned about the immunogenicity of mouse antibodies in pigs. Poderoso et al. previously used mouse mAbs as surrogate antigens in pigs to evaluate the role of Sn in the induction of humoral responses and noticed an enhanced anti-mouse antibody response in comparison with a non-targeting isotype control mAb [11] . The induction of anti-mouse antibodies was however low after primary injection of the mAb, only after a booster vaccination antibody titres rose significantly. Previously, we have observed an enhanced anti-HSA antibody response after a single dose vaccination of HSA coupled to mAb 41D3 without adverse clinical effects [10] . Therefore, in our future experiments, we will use a single dose of rec41D3-antigen to evaluate the protective efficacy of antigen targeting to pSn. If further experiments confirm the applicability of this targeting technology, 'porcinization' of the recombinant antibody will be examined to enable prime-booster vaccination schedules.", "citance": "A recent report describes the expression of Sn on human mature DCs treated with LPS in vitro [29] , suggesting that Sn may be present on mature DCs during inflammation in vivo as well.", "claims": [{"text": "Sn is expressed on human mature DCs treated with LPS in vitro.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Sn is present on mature DCs during inflammation in vivo.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Improvement is needed, especially regarding increasingly complex in vitro methods. Good Cell Culture Practice (GCCP) was an effort from 1996 to 2005 to develop such minimum quality standards also applicable in academia. This paper summarizes recent key developments in in vitro cell culture and addresses the issues resulting for GCCP, e.g. the development of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and gene-edited cells. It further deals with human stem-cell-derived models and bioengineering of organo-typic cell cultures, including organoids, organ-on-chip and human-on-chip approaches. Commercial vendors and cell banks have made human primary cells more widely available over the last decade, increasing their use, but also requiring specific guidance as to GCCP. The characterization of cell culture systems including high-content imaging and high-throughput measurement technologies increasingly combined with more complex cell and tissue cultures represent a further challenge for GCCP. The increasing use of gene editing techniques to generate and modify in vitro culture models also requires discussion of its impact on GCCP. International (often varying) legislations and market forces originating from the commercialization of cell and tissue products and technologies are further impacting on the need for the use of GCCP.

Pluripotency is determined by analysis of gene and protein expression of pluripotency-related factors (still under discussion) by qPCR, immunofluorescence staining (e.g., TRA-1-160, SSEA-3, OSKM, Nanog), or by detailed transcriptional profiling using the PluriTest (M\u00fcller et al., 2011) . Regarding differentiation potential of hPSC, it is required to show formation of derivatives of all three germ layers. Although teratoma formation following transplantation of hPSCs in immunocompromised mice has been the preferred approach, it is now clear that for ethical, economic and practically reasons (Buta et al., 2013) alternative in vitro differentiation assays are preferred. Since karyotypic abnormalities are frequently observed in 10-30% of hPSC cultures, it is an important aspect to characterize karyotype stability of established cell cultures using whole genome arrays or sequencing approaches, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms, comparative genome hybridization and exome-sequencing. Essential characterization of hPSC has been described in detail (Pamies et al., 2017a) .For differentiation of hPSC to specialized cell types (including cells from heart, brain, kidney, liver, vasculature, pancreas, immune system), similar to maintenance of hPSC cultures, it is preferable to use chemically defined media and to avoid complex biological materials of animal origin, such as FBS. In recent years, many different research groups demonstrated the production of specialized functional cell types derived from hPSC and more refined and efficient protocols have been defined for cell types representing a range of tissues (Passier et al., 2016) . However, it is important to recognize that differentiated cultures often contain a mixture of different cell types and the proportions of these populations may vary between different protocols and different batches produced with the same protocol.Use of iPSC cell lines enables the comparison of healthy and diseased cells from patients with diagnosed disorders, which 3.5 Human pluripotent stem cells and Principle 6: Provision of relevant and adequate education and training for all personnel, to promote high quality work and safety The generation of hPSCs, culture maintenance, characterization and differentiation to specific cell types require careful training. Since various technologies and protocols are available for the different steps of these procedures, this represents a true challenge for the field and complicates standardization. It is important that leading groups, institutes and organizations coordinate training in the various methods in the hPSC field, which will increase the robustness and reproducibility of methods and facilitate comparisons of research findings between groups.

We examined the influence of these downstream nucleotides on translation termination success or failure in mammalian cells at the three stop codons. The expected hierarchy in the intrinsic fidelity of the stop codons (UAA>UAG>>UGA) was observed, with highly influential effects on termination readthrough mediated by nucleotides at position +4 and position +8. A more complex influence was observed from the nucleotides at positions +5 and +6. The weakest termination contexts were most affected by increases or decreases in the concentration of the decoding release factor (eRF1), indicating that eRF1 binding to these signals was rate-limiting. When termination efficiency was significantly reduced by cognate suppressor tRNAs, the observed influence of downstream nucleotides was maintained. There was a positive correlation between experimentally measured signal strength and frequency of the signal in eukaryotic genomes, particularly in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster. We propose that termination efficiency is not only influenced by interrogation of the stop signal directly by the release factor, but also by downstream ribosomal interactions with the mRNA nucleotides in the entry channel.", "citation_paragraph": "A number of studies have provided evidence that nucleotides downstream of the eukaryotic translational stop codon can affect the efficiency of translation termination (21, 28, (30) (31) (32) . While nucleotides close to the codon could have a direct effect by interacting with the decoding release factor, eRF1, as shown with the +4 base (6,7) it has been puzzling how nucleotides quite distant could have such a direct effect. In the current study, we have investigated the influences of those nucleotides within the mRNA channel of the ribosome, when a stop codon is in the A site of the decoding centre, during translation of that codon.Cryo-EM studies of the eukaryotic translational termination complex with eRF1 have shown that the +4 and +5 nucleotides of the stop codon context base stack with 18S rRNA bases G626 and C1698 respectively (6) (7) (8) . Stacking would be more stable if a purine were present in the +4 position (G626) (6) , and a purine in the +5 position (C1698) (8) increasing the stability of the decoding complex. Additionally, hydroxylation of a proline residue in the ribosomal protein uS12, which contacts the mRNA backbone near the +4 nucleotide, modulates readthrough efficiency in a direction dependent on the base in the +4 position, implying a special contribution of this nucleotide to the termination process (67) . Consistent with this we found that the position following the A site stop codon (+4) has a particularly strong influence on the efficiency and fidelity of the decoding event. Additionally, the next two positions (+5 and +6) are also significantly influential in a complex manner, both from the perspective of the identity of the nucleotide in each position and through combinations of nucleotides from +4 to +6. This indicates that the interaction between the mRNA and the ribosomal components, like the rRNA nucleotides that line the channel, influence the translation decoding rate. RNase footprinting studies indicate that the length of mRNA protected within the eukaryotic ribosome is approximately 28-31 nt, depending on digestion conditions (60, 61, 68, 69) . This suggests that the mRNA channel in the eukaryotic ribosome protects a very similar number of nucleotides to that of the bacterial ribosome (59, 70) . Consistent with this we found that even in the outer reaches of the channel near to the entry point for the mRNA, the +8 nucleotide position can have strong effects to improve the efficiency of a poorly performing +1 UGA +3 stop codon as an efficient termination signal. Although we conducted only limited studies of sequence variations for the +7 to +9 distant positions, the results suggested the +8 position was transcripts. Expression levels of sup-tRNA relative to 5.8S rRNA are indicated. The sup-tRNA probe was able to detect ptRNA amber, ptRNA ochre and ptRNA opal as it was complementary to the anticodon loop of the tRNA, but degenerative for the specific anticodon sequence.

Notably, however, the +9 nucleotide has been observed to have a significant effect on readthrough depending upon the upstream context, indicating that caution is required when generalising these results to all stop signals (30, 31) .Both bioinformatics ( Figure 5 ) and previous in vitro and in vivo experimental studies have implied the existence of a eukaryotic translation termination element that encompasses nucleotides both upstream and downstream of the stop codon (20, 22, 35, 45, 71) . Parts of such an indicative element could have quite different influences on the efficiency of termination depending on where they are positioned. For example, the upstream sequence through its coding potential determines which amino acids are present in the PTC and exit tunnel as well as which tRNAs are favoured in the E and P sites preceding a stop codon. A nascent peptide designated MTO1 within the Arabidopsis thaliana CGS1 coding region causes ribosomes to stall in response to S-adenosyll-methionine during elongation (72) . Expression of the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) gp48 gene is reduced by translation of its uORF2 nascent peptide (73) , which causes ribosomes to stall at the uORF2 termination codon (74) . These studies reveal the paradoxical potential for interactions between a nascent peptide and eRF1 to obstruct the translation termination cascade.Eukaryotic eRF3 strongly stimulates peptide release by eRF1 (75) through its GTPase activity indicating a role for class-2 release factors in eukaryotic termination. It is of note that binding of eRF1-eRF3-GTP to pre-termination complexes (pre-TCs) also induces a 2-nt forwardshift of their toeprint (75) , caused by the compaction of the mRNA in the termination complex (6, 76) . Therefore, it is possible that sequences particularly amenable to such contraction would be favoured, suggesting another mechanism of how the extended termination signal could operate in vivo.It has emerged that the evolutionarily distinct bacterial and eukaryotic decoding release factors interact with the stop codon through different parts of their structures, including the major recognition loop and helix a5 region for bacterial RFs (77, 78) and three distinctly separate peptide regions from the N-domain of eRF1 that surround the stop codon on the ribosome (5,6). The exquisite geometry required for productive interaction and recognition of the stop codons highlights the importance of the correct orientation of the bases with respect to the amino acids of the eRF1. There is strong evidence for a significant conformational change in eRF1 on binding to eRF3 in solution or alone on the ribosome, causing eRF1 to adopt a bent conformation that resembles a tRNA (5) (6) (7) (8) 79, 80) . This dynamic structural change highlights how each individual factor/nucleotide interaction might be highly sensitive to perturbation from the distal nucleotides. As the more distal downstream bases in the mRNA can make interactions with ribosomal moieties in the channel they may distort the positioning of the upstream RNA bases affecting individual factor/nucleotide interaction required for decoding.The overall conformation of the ribosome in the pretermination state resembles the post-translocation state ribosome, with peptidyl-tRNA in the P site, which is locked in the nonratcheted conformation (7) . In this conformation, there is a \u223c8.5\u2022 rotation of the small subunit compared to the ratcheted state, reminiscent of the range of rotation for bacterial ribosomes (70, 81) . Therefore, during translation termination, with sense codons in the P and E sites, there is a closure of the ribosomal mRNA channel that must trigger a network of interactions between the mRNA and the ribosome. This could explain why the downstream nucleotides distant from the stop codon can influence termination so markedly. In the model generated from the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a termination complex reported by Shao et al. (8) continuous density around the +7 base is observed which is perhaps indicative of direct contact between the ribosome and mRNA in the entrance channel.The translation termination elements of UAA and UAG UAA and UAG stop codons have a very high degree of termination fidelity and competitiveness against near-cognate events. It is tempting to dismiss the concept of a signal element with these codons since they are less markedly influenced by the downstream nucleotides. The oligonucleotide UAAC is, however, several-fold less efficient than UAAG at facilitating termination in a cell-free in vitro termination assay where there is no competition from tRNAs to decode the signal and the UAA codon itself is inactive (65) . In our current study in cultured cells, the identity of the +4 nucleotide also has a significant effect on fidelity, so evidence for a four-base stop signal is compelling even with these high strength signals.The patterns of stop failure were different between UAA and UAG signals, possibly resulting from the differences in UAG stop codon recognition by eRF1 (utilising E55) from that of UAA (6) . There was, by contrast, a good correlation in the patterns for particular signals where data are available between yeast and our two mammalian cell lines, consistent with the high conservation of eRF1 among eukaryotes (82) . The twelve sequences investigated by Bonetti et al. (21) to examine the effect of the +4 base on readthrough in yeast were included in our examined sequences, and comparison between the two studies reveals a comparable pattern of termination failure rates for the UAGNAU and UAANAU signals. However, there is a difference in signal readthrough in the UAGNAU context, with our study identifying higher readthrough with the UAGUAU context than Bonetti et al., who reported higher readthrough with UAG-CAU (21). These differences may reflect the reported influence of the last C terminal amino acid and mRNA sequence 5 of the stop codon on termination efficiencies (28, 29) , as the 5 context varied significantly between the two studies.", "citance": "Stacking would be more stable if a purine were present in the +4 position (G626) (6) , and a purine in the +5 position (C1698) (8) increasing the stability of the decoding complex.", "claims": [{"text": "Stacking is more stable when a purine is present in the +5 position (C1698).", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

In an organism as simple as Volvox (a type of green algae), gastrulation brings about a dramatic reorganization, which is believed to be a consequence of cell shape changes alone. The Volvox embryo is a spherical monolayer that turns itself inside-out, exposing its flagella to the exterior (Kirk, 2005) . Time-lapse live imaging and mathematical modeling have demonstrated that a few cells reshape into wedges, inducing local tissue curvature which, together with successive tissue extension (Taniguchi et al., 2015) . (D) Mechanical properties affect cell differentiation and patterning. Shown is an example demonstrating that cells cultured on a softer surface have a higher propensity for mesodermal differentiation than those cultured on a stiff surface. (E) Geometric confinement may give rise to a signaling gradient. Shown is an example of the BMP4-induced differentiation of hESCs grown in colonies of different sizes. The cells sense BMP4 only at the edge of the colony (i.e. only the cells in between the two dotted circles are competent to receive the BMP4 signal), inducing the secretion of an inhibitor which, together with the BMP4, establishes a signaling gradient. The result is a radially symmetric pattern of gene expression resembling that of germ layer formation in gastrulation. As the signaling gradient is constant, the inner cell fates do not arise in small colonies. TE, trophectoderm. Microscopy images adapted with permission (Deglincerti et al., 2016b) . and contraction, provide the mechanical force for complete embryo inversion (Hohn et al., 2015) . The transfer of mechanical force across the embryo is achieved by a kinesin motor that is localized at the cytosolic bridges connecting all the cells (Nishii et al., 2003) . Another recent study implied that, although the cellular and signaling events in gastrulation can be vastly different among species, it is the mechanics of gastrulation that might be evolutionarily conserved (Brunet et al., 2013) . This study used a myosin inhibitor to prevent cell movements during gastrulation in zebrafish. Although this treatment did not affect the initial specification of germ layers, an early mesodermal marker, ntl (also known as ta; a brachyury ortholog), was not expressed in the embryo. However, by injecting these cells with magnetic beads, gastrulation could be mimicked by an external magnetic field used to pull the cells. This process rescued ntl expression and the associated gastrulation movements in the embryo (Brunet et al., 2013) . According to the authors, a possible explanation for this finding is that mechanical forces trigger mechanosensory nuclear translocation of \u03b2-catenin, an evolutionarily conserved pathway, to initiate the expression of downstream mesodermal genes.Mesoderm formation is also highly sensitive to the mechanical properties of the substrate (Fig. 2D) . By differentiating hESCs grown on hydrogel substrates of different stiffness, it was found that a soft substrate (with a stiffness of 400 Pa) promotes more abundant expression of mesodermal markers than does a stiff (60 kPa) substrate (Przybyla et al., 2016) . Of note, the stiffness of a typical plastic or glass tissue culture dish is >1 GPa. This study also suggested that stiff substrates promote the degradation of \u03b2-catenin in an integrin-dependent manner, thereby inhibiting mesodermal differentiation (Przybyla et al., 2016) .", "citance": "This study also suggested that stiff substrates promote the degradation of \u03b2-catenin in an integrin-dependent manner, thereby inhibiting mesodermal differentiation (Przybyla et al., 2016) .", "claims": [{"text": "Stiff substrates encourage mesodermal differentiation by degrading beta-catenin in an integrin-dependent manner.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Stiff substrates inhibit mesodermal differentiation by degrading beta-catenin in an integrin-dependent manner.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 51907650, "title": "Changing the Approach to Anticoagulant Therapy in Older Patients with Multimorbidity Using a Precision Medicine Approach", "abstract": "The ageing of the world population has resulted in an increase in the number of older patients with multimorbid conditions receiving multiple therapies. This emerging clinical scenario poses new challenges, which are mostly related to the increased incidence of adverse effects. This translates into poor clinical care, reduced cost-effectiveness of drug therapies, and social isolation of multimorbid patients due to reduced autonomy. A strategy to address these emerging challenges could involve the personalization of therapies based on the clinical, molecular, and genetic characterization of multimorbid patients. Anticoagulation therapy is a feasible model to implement personalized medicine since it generally involves older multimorbid patients receiving multiple drugs. In this study, in patients with atrial fibrillation, the use of the new generation of anticoagulation therapy, i.e., direct oral anti-coagulants (DOACs), is based on a preliminary assessment of the molecular targets of DOACS and any possible drug\u207bdrug interactions. Then, the genetic polymorphism of enzymes metabolizing DOACs is studied. After DOAC prescription, its circulating levels are measured. Clinical data are being collected to assess whether this personalized approach improves the safety and efficacy profiles of anticoagulation therapy using DOACs, thereby reducing the costs of healthcare for ageing multimorbid patients.", "citation_paragraph": "Ageing is associated with the development of chronic diseases and their complications. Ageing plays a role in the genesis of atrial fibrillation [13] , which is the most common type of arrhythmia diagnosed in clinical practice. The consequences of atrial fibrillation have been clearly established in multiple large observational cohort studies and include increased stroke and systemic embolism rates if no oral anticoagulation is prescribed, with increased morbidity and mortality [14] . With the worldwide aging of the population characterized by a large influx of \"baby boomers\" with or without risk factors for developing atrial fibrillation, an epidemic is forecasted within the next 10 to 20 years [14] . Although not all studies support this evidence, it is clear that atrial fibrillation is on the rise and significant of health resources are being invested in detecting and managing atrial fibrillation [14] .To prevent stroke and systemic embolism, oral anticoagulants are largely prescribed. However, most of the patients with atrial fibrillation are older adults and present with other chronic conditions. Multimorbidity is now becoming a major concern for the effective and safe treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation and in need of anticoagulation. A clear example is given by patients with chronic kidney disease and receiving oral anticoagulation. Kumar et al. assessed the association between anticoagulation, ischemic stroke, gastrointestinal and cerebral hemorrhage, and all-cause mortality in this specific clinical setting [15] . The study included 6977 patients with chronic kidney disease (i.e., estimated glomerular filtration rate of <50 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) and newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation. Of these, 2434 were on anticoagulants within 60 days of diagnosis and 4543 were not. The crude rates for ischemic stroke and hemorrhage were 4.6 and 1.2 after taking anticoagulants and 1.5 and 0.4 in patients who were not taking anticoagulant per 100 person years, respectively. The hazard ratios for ischemic stroke, hemorrhage, and all-cause mortality for those on anticoagulants were 2.60, 2.42, and 0.82, respectively compared with those who received no anticoagulation. Therefore, giving anticoagulants to older people with concomitant atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease is associated with an increased rate of ischemic stroke and hemorrhage but a paradoxical lowered rate of all-cause mortality [15] .For decades, warfarin, which inhibits vitamin K metabolism, represented the first choice for oral anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation. The disadvantage of warfarin-based therapy is related to the need for regular monitoring of coagulation, indicating that under-or over-dosage are significant possibilities in daily clinical practice. More recently, new oral anticoagulants (NOAs), also known as direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have become available. They are now largely prescribed since it is not necessary to regularly monitor coagulation markers. Also, specific clinical advantages have been reported for the use of DOACs vs. warfarin. Bai et al. analyzed the effectiveness and safety of warfarin use compared with warfarin non-use and DOACs in atrial fibrillation patients aged \u226565 years [16] . After searching PubMed and the Cochrane Library, 26 studies were included, with 10 comparing warfarin with warfarin non-use and 16 comparing warfarin with DOACs [16] . The results showed that warfarin use was superior to no antithrombotic therapy and aspirin for stroke/thromboembolism prevention [16] . Warfarin use was associated with a non-significant increase in risk of major bleeding compared with no antithrombotic therapy and aspirin. DOACs were superior to warfarin for stroke/thromboembolism prevention, and also were associated with reduced risk of major bleeding.Similarly, Inohara et al. showed that among 141,311 patients with intracerebral hemorrhage, 15,036 (10.6%) were taking warfarin, 4918 (3.5%) were taking DOACs preceding intracerebral hemorrhage, and 39,585 (28.0%) and 5783 (4.1%) were taking concomitant single and dual antiplatelet agents, respectively [17] . Patients with prior use of warfarin or DOACs were older and had higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation and prior stroke. Acute intracerebral hemorrhage stroke severity (measured by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale) was not significantly different across the three groups. The unadjusted in-hospital mortality rates were 32.6% for warfarin, 26.5% for DOACs, and 22.5% for no DOACs. Compared with patients with prior use of warfarin, patients with prior use of DOACs had a lower risk of in-hospital mortality [17] .This robust evidence of superior efficacy and safety should not lead us to overlook the inherent bleeding and thromboembolic risk of any anticoagulant therapy, including DOACs. Although it is acknowledged that inappropriate dosing of DOACs contributes to an increased risk of stroke [18] , recent evidence shows that plasma concentrations of DOACs may significantly vary from patient to patient. Gulilat et al. reported that among 243 patients receiving DOACs (rivaroxaban, n = 94; apixaban, n = 149), a 60-and 50-fold interpatient variation in plasma concentration was observed for rivaroxaban and apixaban, respectively [19] . Approximately 12% of patients receiving rivaroxaban and 13% of patients receiving apixaban exceeded the 95th percentile for predicted maximum plasma concentration observed in clinical trials [19] . Therefore, DOAC plasma concentrations tend to be more variable than those observed in clinical trials, posing an additional clinical risk to the patients. Indeed, in a geriatric population, inter-and intra-individual coefficients of variation were 59.5% and 44.7% for peak and 74.5% and 44.6% for trough, respectively, and high through concentrations identified patients at risk of bleeding [20] . Identification of additional clinical and molecular determinants that more fully predict patients at risk for excessively high or low DOAC concentrations may enable a more precise DOAC dosing regimen for the individual patient.It is acknowledged that drug-drug interactions are responsible of DOAC metabolism. In an in vitro series of experiments, Margelidon-Cozzolino et al. showed that phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors, a drug class commonly used in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, inhibit rivaroxaban and apixaban efflux in a cellular model of drug transport assay [21] . However, beyond drug-drug interactions which likely occur in patients with polypharmacy, the individual metabolic and genetic profile of older patients receiving DOACs may provide useful information to personalize treatments. In this regard, it is important to note that the translation into clinical practice of large randomized clinical trials may not yield the expected benefits to the older population, since this class of patients is frequently excluded from enrollment. Also, it should be noted that polymorbid patients are not usually considered for enrollment in clinical trials, whereas polymorbidity is highly prevalent among older adults treated in the real world.", "citance": "Compared with patients with prior use of warfarin, patients with prior use of DOACs had a lower risk of in-hospital mortality [17] .This robust evidence of superior efficacy and safety should not lead us to overlook the inherent bleeding and thromboembolic risk of any anticoagulant therapy, including DOACs.", "claims": [{"text": "Stroke patients with prior use of direct oral anticoagulants have a higher risk of in-hospital mortality than stroke patients with prior use of warfarin.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Stroke patients with prior use of direct oral anticoagulants have a lower risk of in-hospital mortality than stroke patients with prior use of warfarin.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 30162583, "title": "Evidence-based selection process to the Master of Public Health program at Medical University", "abstract": "BACKGROUND Evaluation of the predictive validity of selected sociodemographic factors and admission criteria for Master's studies in Public Health at the Faculty of Health Sciences, Medical University of Warsaw (MUW).   METHODS For the evaluation purposes recruitment data and learning results of students enrolled between 2008 and 2012 were used (N = 605, average age 22.9 \u00b1 3.01). The predictive analysis was performed using the multiple linear regression method. In the proposed regression model 12 predictors were selected, including: sex, age, professional degree (BA), the Bachelor's studies grade point average (GPA), total score of the preliminary examination broken down into five thematic areas. Depending on the tested model, one of two dependent variables was used: first-year GPA or cumulative GPA in the Master program.   RESULTS The regression model based on the result variable of Master's GPA program was better matched to data in comparison to the model based on the first year GPA (adjusted R2 0.413 versus 0.476 respectively). The Bachelor's studies GPA and each of the five subtests comprising the test entrance exam were significant predictors of success achieved by a student both after the first year and at the end of the course of studies.   CONCLUSIONS Criteria of admissions with total score of MCQs exam and Bachelor's studies GPA can be successfully used for selection of the candidates for Master's degree studies in Public Health. The high predictive validity of the recruitment system confirms the validity of the adopted admission policy at MUW.", "citation_paragraph": "In this paper, its authors have attempted to answer the question of whether the selection criteria for candidates for the Master's studies in Public Health adopted by the MUW have the predictive value in predicting students' future. The most important finding of the study was the fact that admissions criteria are strong predictors of academic grades (firs-year GPA and cumulative GPA). This suggests that academic success of Public Health students is closely related to the initial level of their educational potential (knowledge, skills and abilities). The results of the analyses generally conform to the findings of Lamadrid-Figueroa et al. concerning the effectiveness of candidate selection in the National Institute of Public Health of Mexico (Instituto Nacional de Salud P\u00fablica) [3] . With reference to the cumulative GPA, they demonstrated that the Bachelor's studies GPA is a strong predictor of success, which confirms that it is a very effective admission criterion. As shown in this paper, the Bachelor's studies GPA also indicated a very strong predictive ability.The first-year GPA is very often used in predictive studies on the efficiency of admission procedure as a measure of an academic success. Recent studies show that those who perform poorly in the early years of medical school, for whatever reason, might be at an increased risk for subsequent professional misconduct [41] . The present results demonstrated that all admission criteria used at MUW had a significant impact on the academic success of students with reference to both the first-year GPA and cumulative GPA.A comparison of both predictions of academic success presented in the present paper may show that while in the case of cumulative GPA all admission criteria were valid, their importance was lower than in the case of a success measured with the first-year GPA. Therefore, it can be assumed that results for a test entrance exam are of particular importance for a selection of students who would be at low risk of attrition after the first year due to unsatisfactory progress at school. In accordance with the list prepared by the ASPHER and concerning the necessary skills that a Public Health graduate should have, among the expected competences prevalent are those which are connected with the methodology of research and biostatistics [2, 22] . Mathematical skills are therefore a very important competence that a candidate should have to undertake Public Health studies successfully. The predictive ability of the maths subtest was demonstrated by Lamadrid-Figueroa et al. [3] , whereas in this study the relevant variables were the subtests in Epidemiology and Scientific Method. In addition to the academic variables mentioned above, some background variables (professional title and [32] . In this model, students' academic success is determined by an impact of a combination of different factors, including, among others, background variables. However, not all characteristics of a student are equally important and some of them may be irrelevant in certain circumstances, such as gender or age. Based on these results, it may be assumed that, in the long-term prediction of a student's success (cumulative GPA), the factors that are directly connected with the level of competences measured using the examination test (subtests) and the Bachelor's studies GPA are more important than the sociodemographic variables. The candidate's age (age on entry) may have a potential impact on success during studies. As shown by the results of a number of studies concerning education of health professionals (e.g. nursing), the age is positively correlated with results achieved during studies [28, [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] . Generally, in the case of older students, significantly better results of education are noted compared with students who started studies below the age of 26, irrespectively of any additional qualifications held on entry [28, 43] . In the research on the reasons why students fail to complete their studies, young age is indicated as a negative predictor [44, 46, 47] . As reported by Pryjmachuk et al. [44] the age on entry has a moderate impact on timely graduation. Nevertheless, the results presented in this paper did not demonstrate that age had a major influence on student's academic success.No impact of the gender on achievements of Public Health students was noted by Lamadrid-Figueroa et al. [3] . The above observations are also confirmed by the results of this study, which may be surprising to a certain extent in light of general findings described in this respect in global literature [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] . As proposed by Ferguson et al. on the basis of a systematic review of literature, it is recommended to include gender as an important factor in prediction studies concerning medical education [54] . Most researchers show that women fare better during studies than men [53] . According to the data from US studies that are prevalent in global literature, in most standardized tests applied during entry examinations to schools of higher education, men do better than women [52, 55] . This relationship was observed neither in this paper nor in the findings reported by Lamadrid-Figueroa et al. [3] . It was not shown that the gender had any significant impact on academic success.The assessment of the impact of the entry qualifications of a candidate (the professional title) on the likelihood of success during studies was undertaken in a number of studies related to education of health professionals [28, 43, 46] . It is difficult, however, to compare findings concerning the impact of entry qualifications from studies on education of nurses, midwives or medical rescuers with reference to recruitment for the Master's studies in Public Health. This study shows that holding a Bachelor's degree in Public Health seems to have a positive effect on student performance in the course of the Master's studies. This observation is relevant as the existing admission policy rules for the Public Health program allow graduates of such diversified bachelor degree programs as Dietetics and Food Science, Electroradiology, Emergency Medicine, Nursing and Midwifery, Physiotherapy, Dental Hygiene, and Dental Technology to undertake studies. Such a broad range of entry qualifications may, however, be a hindrance to achieving education results in the course of studies that could be comparable with those achieved by graduates of the Bachelor's studies in Public Health.This study, contrary to expectations, does not show that holding a Bachelor's degree in Public Health has a positive effect on results achieved during the Master's studies. In addition, it was observed in the analysis with the first-year GPA and cumulative GPA that this entry qualification is a negative predictor. The above findings support the existing admission policy rules for the Public Health program that enable graduates of such diversified Bachelor degree programs as Dietetics and Food Science, Electroradiology, Emergency Medicine, Nursing and Midwifery, Physiotherapy, Dental Hygiene, and Dental Technology to undertake studies. The broad scope of entry qualifications does not prevent candidates from achieving, in the course of later studies, education results that are comparable with those achieved by graduates of the Bachelor's studies in Public Health. As shown by the results of the analyses concerning the predictive value of admission criteria (total score of the MCQs exam and the Bachelor's studies GPA), they are sufficient independent factors of a student's academic success.Summing up, it may be concluded that both criteria of acceptance -Bachelor's studies GPA and entrance examination, fulfilled their role in the process of selecting the best candidates. It was evident for instance that the higher the mark average of a student in their studies of the first degree, the better were their achievements in the second degree studies. At the same time, the results of entrance examination were also of certain influence on the academic successes of the students. Despite the great evidence power of this discovery, it needs to be stressed that applying a GPA criterion during the recruitment process is not entirely flawless. The element most often pointed out to is the fact that assessment systems vary greatly at universities that offer studies of the first degree in the area of objective tools that help evaluate knowledge and skills of students. This diversity in evaluation systems in different educational institutions, particularly in the area of applying standardised evaluation method may contribute to the low level of reliability of the qualification process for candidates when this criterion is applied [56] . Bearing that fact in mind, GPA may be recommended as a criterion for acceptance, however, it ought to be complemented by another criterion (other criteria), preferably standardized ones, such as entrance examination and/or interview.", "citance": "Recent studies show that those who perform poorly in the early years of medical school, for whatever reason, might be at an increased risk for subsequent professional misconduct [41] .", "claims": [{"text": "Students who perform poorly in the early years of medical school are at increased risk for professional misconduct later in their careers.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Students who perform poorly in the early years of medical school are less likely to commit professional misconduct later in their careers.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}

A literature search was performed using the terms \u201cautonomic neuropathy,\u201d \"dysautonomia,\u201d and \u201cautonomic symptoms\u201d in patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis and familial amyloid polyneuropathy. Various scales to measure autonomic function have been employed, particularly within the major clinical trials, to assess novel therapies for the disease. Most of the evaluations were taken from diabetic clinical trials. Questionnaires include the COMPASS-31 and Norfolk QOL autonomic nerve function domain, whereas clinical evaluations comprise HRDB and the orthostatic tolerance test. Several treatment options are being employed although only diflunisal and tafamidis have reported improvement in the autonomic abnormalities. Autonomic nerves are often affected before motor nerve impairment, and dysautonomia may support the diagnosis of hATTR amyloidosis when differentiating from other adult-onset progressive neuropathies and from other types of amyloidosis.

Unfortunately, there is no current single standardized approach to evaluate dysautonomia in hATTR amyloidosis.", "citation_paragraph": "The peripheral autonomic nerves are often affected before motor nerve impairment has been noted [5] . This can be attributed to the morphologic characteristics of the nerves as unmyelinated, small myelinated and large fibers, becoming impaired in that order [6] . More amyloid deposits have been found in the spinal ganglion and posterior root of the spine than in the anterior root of the motor nerves, and peripheral catecholamine depletion has also been described [5] .Autonomic nervous system involvement consists of orthostatic hypotension, sexual impotence, disturbances of gastrointestinal motility (most commonly diarrhea alternating with constipation, but also constipation, diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting), dyshidrosis, erectile dysfunction, and neurogenic bladder [5] [6] [7] 15] .The most dangerous autonomic manifestation is cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy, as it may induce lifethreatening arrhythmias and sudden death. It is due to the impairment of autonomic control of the cardiovascular system. Warning signs include reduced heart rate variability (HRV) and decreased baroreflex sensibility with abnormal blood pressure regulation and orthostatic hypotension [16] . Sudden death has been reported in patients with complex ventricular arrhythmias and with orthostatic hypotension without cardiac conduction abnormalities, attributed to low sympathetic and parasympathetic responses [17] . Cardiovascular impairment of the autonomic function has been found to be unrelated to the severity of the peripheral polyneuropathy, particularly the presence of vagal hyperactivity or parasympathetic receptor hypersensitivity and sympathetic denervation of the heart [16] [17] [18] .Gastrointestinal symptoms are the result of a loss in the inhibitory and increase in the excitatory enteric neurons, which may result in gastroparesis, dysmotility, constipation, or diarrhea [15] . Amyloid deposition occurs in the muscularis mucosae, in proximity to the vasculature, nerves, and nerve plexuses. This deposition increases the frailty of blood vessels, hinders intrinsic peristalsis, and decreases the compliance of the gut wall [19] . Amyloid infiltration and destruction of the celiac ganglion, vagus nerve, and sympathetic chain ganglia and nerves have been found in the small intestine and esophagus of patients with hATTR amyloidosis [5] .Earlier damage of the sacral parasympathetic fibers contributes to genitourinary dysfunction, starting from impaired bladder sensation with an increase in urine retention to dysuria, nicturia, incomplete bladder emptying, and urgency up to overflow incontinence due to the progressive involvement of motor sympathetic and somatic nerves. Urinary retention and urinary tract infections contribute to severe morbidity to the point that urosepsis may be the cause of death in some patients [20] . Erectile dysfunction is one of the earliest findings in the course of the disease in males, and most patients develop bladder dysfunction during the course of the disease.Pupillomotor and sudomotor functions are also impaired. The sympathetic predominance in pupil control decreases its diameter at rest. Scalloped pupils, defined as bilateral, irregular pupillary margins and fringed edges, are a unique sign of patients with hATTR [21] (Fig. 1a, b) .Patients have inappropriately cold hands and feet with discoloration, suggesting that the vasoregulation of the peripheral vessels is impaired. Several Doppler ultrasound studies have supported blood flow alterations [5, 22, 23] .These vasomotor changes, in addition to pain insensitivity, result in chronic ulceration and mutilation of the acral extremities that habitually complicate the disease (Fig. 1c-e) .", "citance": "Sudden death has been reported in patients with complex ventricular arrhythmias and with orthostatic hypotension without cardiac conduction abnormalities, attributed to low sympathetic and parasympathetic responses [17] .", "claims": [{"text": "Sudden death can occur in patients with complex ventricular arrhythmias.", "subject": "patients with complex ventricular arrhythmias", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Sudden death can occur in patients with orthostatic hypertension without cardiac conduction abnormalities.", "subject": "patients with orthostatic hypertension ", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 3808528, "title": "Antibiotic Stimulation of a Bacillus subtilis Migratory Response", "abstract": "Competitive interactions between bacteria reveal physiological adaptations that benefit fitness. Bacillus subtilis is a Gram-positive species with several adaptive mechanisms for competition and environmental stress. Biofilm formation, sporulation, and motility are the outcomes of widespread changes in a population of B. subtilis. These changes emerge from complex, regulated pathways for adapting to external stresses, including competition from other species. To identify competition-specific functions, we cultured B. subtilis with multiple species of Streptomyces and observed altered patterns of growth for each organism. In particular, when plated on agar medium near Streptomyces venezuelae, B. subtilis initiates a robust and reproducible mobile response. To investigate the mechanistic basis for the interaction, we determined the type of motility used by B. subtilis and isolated inducing metabolites produced by S. venezuelae. Bacillus subtilis has three defined forms of motility: swimming, swarming, and sliding. Streptomyces venezuelae induced sliding motility specifically in our experiments. The inducing agents produced by S. venezuelae were identified as chloramphenicol and a brominated derivative at subinhibitory concentrations. Upon further characterization of the mobile response, our results demonstrated that subinhibitory concentrations of chloramphenicol, erythromycin, tetracycline, and spectinomycin all activate a sliding motility response by B. subtilis. Our data are consistent with sliding motility initiating under conditions of protein translation stress. This report underscores the importance of hormesis as an early warning system for potential bacterial competitors and antibiotic exposure. IMPORTANCE Antibiotic resistance is a major challenge for the effective treatment of infectious diseases. Identifying adaptive mechanisms that bacteria use to survive low levels of antibiotic stress is important for understanding pathways to antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, little is known about the effects of individual bacterial interactions on multispecies communities. This work demonstrates that subinhibitory amounts of some antibiotics produced by streptomycetes induce active motility in B. subtilis, which may alter species interaction dynamics among species-diverse bacterial communities in natural environments. The use of antibiotics at subinhibitory concentrations results in many changes in bacteria, including changes in biofilm formation, small-colony variants, formation of persisters, and motility. Identifying the mechanistic bases of these adaptations is crucial for understanding how bacterial communities are impacted by antibiotics.", "citation_paragraph": "acteria have various mechanisms to maintain fitness under conditions of competitive stress. Examples of competitive fitness mechanisms include type VI secretion systems or contact-dependent inhibition (1) (2) (3) and chemical mechanisms as exemplified by antibiotics and other specialized metabolites (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . Resistance to a specific challenge also promotes competitive fitness through chemical or genetic modifications to a target or a toxin (9) (10) (11) . Additionally, adaptations to the physiology of cells within a population or community may alter susceptibility to various competitive stresses. For instance, bacteria may induce biofilm formation (8) , enter a persister state (12) , or activate a specialized form of metabolism in response to competitors (13) (14) (15) (16) . One adaptive mechanism available to many species is motility, which imparts to bacteria the ability to physically relocate in the event of a competitive challenge (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) . In some cases, the response may be chemotactic, manifesting as avoidance of a toxic substance through receptor activation of motility controls. Other sensing or stress mechanisms that activate mobility are not well defined. In one example, swimming and swarming motility are enhanced when Pseudomonas aeruginosa is exposed to the antibiotic tobramycin, but the underlying mechanism is unknown (22) . How bacteria sense and respond to antibiotic stress is of particular interest for understanding the development of antibiotic resistance. Indeed, a connection between motility and antibiotic resistance, where resistance is elevated in some motile populations of bacteria, has been found (23, 24) .Bacillus subtilis serves as a model for motility of Gram-positive bacteria. B. subtilis has three described mechanisms of motility: swimming, swarming, and sliding (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) . Swimming and swarming motility are driven by the action of flagella, which provide propulsion to the bacteria. Swimming B. subtilis use multiple, peritrichous flagella to move as single cells through aqueous media. When the surrounding medium is sufficiently viscous, B. subtilis cells join into rafts that use swarming motility to migrate across surfaces under the power of flagella extending from multiple cells (26) . The third type of movement, sliding, is flagellum-independent motility driven by growth. Sliding is currently understood to depend upon multiple factors, including potassium, production of the lipopeptide surfactin, exopolysaccharides (EPS), and extracellular proteins BslA and TasA (29) (30) (31) . At the vanguard of a sliding population, combinations of surfactin-producing cells and EPS-producing cells cooperate to generate \"van Gogh\" bundles characteristic of sliding on specialized media (30) . The coordinated activities of cell subpopulations within a colony indicates orchestration of multiple events to promote cooperative sliding. Some regulatory functions that contribute to sliding mobility have been described previously (31) , but the overall process is less clearly understood than either swimming or swarming motilities. Additionally, other competitive functions may be coordinately controlled with mobilization of cells. In combination with resistance functions, a mobilized bacterial population potentially possesses multiple advantages for competitive fitness.Here we describe a competitive interaction between Streptomyces venezuelae and B. subtilis. We observed that, under conditions of coculture with S. venezuelae, B. subtilis activates a motile response. First, we identified the type of motility as sliding. Second, we extracted an inducer of sliding motility from agar plates of S. venezuelae and, to our surprise, identified the inducer as the antibiotic chloramphenicol (Cm). At subinhibitory concentrations, many antibiotics possess stimulatory activity, triggering a response in exposed bacteria. This phenomenon, known as hormesis, has been studied for many species and antibiotics (32, 33) . Prior studies have shown that subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics induce responses in exposed bacteria, including changes in transcription, biofilm formation, persistence, and altered virulence (5, 22, (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) . While tobramycin was previously seen to enhance motility of P. aeruginosa, induction of motility in an otherwise nonmotile population has rarely been reported (19, 20, 22, 34, 38) . In addition to chloramphenicol, we found that other antibiotics that target the ribosome also induce motility. Targeted analysis of genes associated with translation stress and antibiotic resistance suggested that the sliding response occurs when ribosome function is perturbed. On the basis of these observations, we suggest that B. subtilis engages a programed motile response to competitive stress that results from subinhibitory antibiotic interference with protein translation.", "citance": "At the vanguard of a sliding population, combinations of surfactin-producing cells and EPS-producing cells cooperate to generate \"van Gogh\" bundles characteristic of sliding on specialized media (30) .", "claims": [{"text": "Surfactin producing cells and exopolymer producing cells cooperate to generate \"Van Gogh\" bundles that have sliding abilities on specialized media.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

We hypothesized that there is no significant difference in upper-extremity specific disability between patients treated with operative fixation and patients treated nonoperatively after displaced proximal humeral fracture. Our secondary null hypotheses were that there were no differences in pain intensity, satisfaction and physical function.    Methods: Thirty-three patients treated with operative fixation were enrolled and randomly matched with 33 patients treated nonoperatively according to age (within 5 years), sex, ASA-score, Neer fracture type and mechanism of injury. The patients were evaluated using the disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand (DASH) scale, the constant score, short form (SF)-36 health survey, CESD, the pain catastrophizing scale (PCS) and pain intensity and satisfaction questionnaires.    Results: At follow-up, the nonoperatively treated patients had better functional outcomes than the operatively treated patients. Nonoperatively treated patients also scored better on pain intensity and satisfaction. There were no significant differences in CESD, PCS, and SF-36 physical- and mental health summary scores between cohorts.

{"s2orc_id": 53098357, "title": "Organellar TRP channels", "abstract": "Mammalian transient receptor potential (TRP) channels mediate Ca2+ flux and voltage changes across membranes in response to environmental and cellular signals. At the plasma membrane, sensory TRPs act as neuronal detectors of physical and chemical environmental signals, and receptor-operated (metabotropic) TRPs decode extracellular neuroendocrine cues to control body homeostasis. In intracellular membranes, such as those in lysosomes, organellar TRPs respond to compartment-derived signals to control membrane trafficking, signal transduction, and organelle function. Complementing mouse and human genetics and high-resolution structural approaches, physiological studies employing natural agonists and synthetic inhibitors have become critical in resolving the in vivo functions of metabotropic, sensory, and organellar TRPs. In this Review, Haoxing Xu and colleagues summarize current knowledge of TRP channels and their roles in the response to environmental and cellular signals, focusing in particular on the least known class, the organellar TRPs.", "citation_paragraph": "TRPY1 in the yeast vacuole. TRPY1, the only TRP-like protein in yeast, is localized in the membrane of the vacuole, which is equivalent to the mammalian lysosome 61 . In response to osmotic shock, changes in cytoplasmic ionic strength and/or mechanical force on the vacuolar membrane activate TRPY1 to mediate vacuolar Ca 2+ release and possibly vacuolar membrane fission 61 . Hence, TRPY1 has dual sensory (activated by an environmental signal) and organellar (vacuole) functionalities 61 . TRPML1 in the lysosome. Lysosomes degrade cargo materials delivered via endocytosis or autophagy, converting them into catabolites and building blocks (for example, amino acids) 65, 66 . The degradation products are transported out of the lysosomes via vesicular trafficking and catabolite exporters 23, 67 . All these lysosome trafficking steps are regulated by various intracellular signals produced according to the status of luminal cargos and products 23, 67 . Both lumen-to-cytosol and cytosol-to-lumen signals need to be decoded 23 . As lysosomes are highly heterogeneous, compartmentspecific intracellular signals, such as changes in lysosomal lipid composition, membrane potential, and juxtalysosomal Ca 2+ levels, may differentially regulate trafficking of individual lysosomes 59, 68 . TRPML1 (also called MCOLN1) channels are the major Ca 2+ -permeable channels in the lysosomes of all cell types. TRPML1-knockout cells exhibit defective lysosomal membrane fusion and fission 23, 69 . Whole-endolysosome patch-clamp studies using artificially enlarged lysosomes 58 59, 70 . TRPML1 channels are activated by cellular cues that regulate lysosome trafficking and function. Phosphatidylinositol 3,5-biphosphate (PI(3,5)P 2 ), a lysosome-specific phosphoinositide, was the first endogenous signal identified for TRPML1, activating it at a physiological, low-nanomolar range concentration 12, 58 . PI(3,5)P 2 binds to positively charged residues in the N-terminus region of TRPML1, resulting in opening of the S6 gate through the S2-S3 linker 12 . PI(3,5)P 2 levels may increase transiently before fusion of two lysosomes 71 and during phagocytic uptake of large particles 72 . Hence, PI(3,5)P 2 dynamics likely serve as the cellular cue that activates lysosomal TRPML1.Several synthetic small-molecule TRPML agonists and inhibitors have been identified 59, 73 . Although synthetic agonists activate TRPML1 independently of endogenous cues 35, 59 , they provide useful tools to probe the channel's cellular functions. The agonist ML-SA1 binds directly to the S5-S6 region of the channel 35 , where it may exert a direct force on the S6 gate 35, 45 . In macrophages, acute ML-SA1 treatment induces the fusion of lysosomes with the plasma membrane (i.e., lysosomal exocytosis) through activation of Ca 2+ sensor synaptotagmin VII (Syt-VII) 74 ( Fig. 3 ) in wild-type but not TRPML1-knockout cells 72 . Retrograde movement of lysosomes to the perinuclear region, which is required for autophagosome-lysosome fusion, is increased with TRPML1 overexpression or synthetic agonism through Ca 2+ sensor EF-hand-protein apoptosis-linked gene 2 (ALG-2) 75 , but reduced by TRPML1 knockout, synthetic inhibition, or PI(3,5)P 2 deficiency 75 (Fig. 3) . Hence, TRPML1 may allow cellular cues, such as lysosomal lipids, to control or regulate lysosomal trafficking by triggering an increase in juxtalysosomal Ca 2+ . TRPML1 is also directly activated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are released from mitochondria under stress conditions to activate autophagosome and lysosome biogenesis 63 . Activation of TRPML1 triggers the Ca 2+ -sensor calcineurin, which in turn promotes the nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of autophagy and lysosome function (Fig. 3) 63 . Activation of TFEB is sufficient to promote mitophagy, removing damaged mitochondria to reduce excessive ROS in the cell 63 . The regulation of TRPML1 by endogenous cellular cues and synthetic modulators illuminates how organellar TRPs are involved in different cellular processes. Although regulation by lipids and ROS is a general feature of TRPs 7 , colocalization of the membrane-delimited activating signal and channel within the same compartment defines a specific organelle function for such regulation. Hence, a signal that acts as an environmental cue for a sensory TRP (for example, ROS) can also act as an intracellular agonist for an organellar TRP such as TRPML1 (ref. 63, 76 ). The specific cellular process regulated by TRPML1 is determined by both activating signals and downstream effectors (for example, Ca 2+ sensors) (Fig. 3) . Given that synthetic agonists activate TRPML1 independent of PI(3,5)P 2 and ROS 12, 59, 63 , it is likely that additional endogenous agonists for TRPML1 exist. It has been demonstrated that sensitivity to ROS, but not to PI(3,5)P 2 , is required for TFEB activation upon mitochondrial damage 63 . Finally, while the major lysosomal membrane potential regulators are likely the two-pore channels (TPCs) 77 , cellular cues that affect lysosomal membrane potential may also regulate lysosome function in a TRPML1-dependent manner 23, 58 , given that TRPML1 currents are strongly rectifying (Fig. 1c) .TRPML2 and TRPML3 in the endosomes and lysosomes. Both TRPML2 and TRPML3 (TRPML2/3) are localized in lysosomes, but only in certain cell types 23, 69, 78 . TRPML1 and TRPML3 play complementary roles in cells expressing both channels, such as intestinal enterocytes and cochlear hair cells 79 . PI(3,5)P 2 activates all three TRPMLs 58 , and it is thus possible that PI(3,5)P 2 serves as the endogenous cellular cue that activates lysosomal TRPML2/3 channels. In the bladder epithelial cells, TRPML3 is activated by lysosomal alkalization to mediate exosome release and bacterial extrusion 62 . TRPML2/3 are also functional in early and recycling endosomes in some cell types 23, 69, 78 . For example, TRPML3 is the primary endosomal channel in some macrophage-type cells 78 , but the cellular signals that activate early-endosomal TRPML3 are still unknown. Moreover, early endosomal functions of TRPML2/3 are not firmly established; lysosomal defects associated with the lack of TRPML2/3 could indirectly affect the functions of early endosomes, such as endocytosis and endosome-autophagosome fusion 23, 69 .", "citance": "Although synthetic agonists activate TRPML1 independently of endogenous cues 35, 59 , they provide useful tools to probe the channel's cellular functions.", "claims": [{"text": "Synthetic agonists activate TRPML1 independently of endogenous cues.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Synthetic agonists deactivate TRPML1 independently of endogenous cues.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}

Relevant databases in transplant medicine, autoimmune diseases and literature regarding uveitis and scleritis were reviewed. Literature with regards systemic IS therapy in transplant recipients and patients with autoimmune diseases revealed a significant increase in malignancies, especially non-melanocytic skin cancers and lymphomas. Studies of patients with IED were limited in number and scope, with no studies adequately evaluating the incidence of malignancy in these patients. Difficulties associated with the evaluation of the risk of malignancy associated with IS therapy in patients with IED include the heterogeneity of the disease and treatment regimens as well as the low frequency of IED, its variable severity and the lack of adequate long-term follow-up studies. Systemic IS therapy is an important therapeutic option in the treatment of patients with severe IED. A well-designed, comprehensive, multi-centre long-term follow-up study is required to evaluate the risk of malignancy in patients with specific IED diseases treated with defined systemic IS therapy. Until such evidence is available, we recommend the adoption of preventative strategies to help minimise the risk of malignancy in such patients.", "citation_paragraph": "There is irrefutable evidence derived from studies of transplant recipients and patients with autoimmune diseases that IS therapy is associated with increased malignancy risk. The limited evidence of malignancy associated with systemic immunosuppressive therapy in patients with IED highlights that this clinical issue has not yet been appropriately addressed.Data derived from transplant registries have strongly established the potential risk of malignancy that results from prolonged IS therapy in order to preserve graft function [39, 50, 51] . The ability to ascertain whether certain IS drugs are associated with a higher malignancy potential is also influenced by previous patient exposure to other IS therapies. These drugs are typically used in combination or consecutively as the introduction of newer IS agents, such as calcineurin inhibitors and biologics, became more widely used [34] . Long-term followup studies of transplant recipients revealed that neoplasms appeared on average 5 years after transplantation and the commencement of IS therapy [1, 41] . Immunosuppressive therapy for allograft recipients differs significantly in regards to dosing and cumulative exposure when compared to patients treated for systemic inflammatory diseases. Similarly, the systemic inflammatory state induced by the allograft may drive carcinogenesis, exacerbated by the use of IS therapy [3] . Therefore, it would be naive to affirm the same risk of developing neoplasia without considering that there may be marked differences in risk between different groups of patients.The literature on the risk carcinogenesis in patients with RA and other inflammatory diseases treated with IS drugs is divided. Numerous studies indicate an increased risk of malignancy with IS therapy, whilst other studies suggest that the increased risk is due to the disease itself (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis [7] , psoriasis [28] and Sj\u00f6gren's disease [52] ). Isomaki et al. suggested that the baseline risk of malignancy in patients with RA might be due to chronic activation of the immune system, leading to an increased incidence of lymphoproliferative disorders. The majority of studies indicate that patients with either rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis are at an increased risk of neoplasia; however, patients treated with systemic IS therapy have a significantly greater incidence of tumours [53] [54] [55] . A number of authors have factored in the baseline risk of neoplasia in patients and compared patients on IS therapy for RA and patients not on such therapy [56] . Other studies did not account for this baseline risk of malignancy in RA, which may inflate their malignancy incidence findings [57] .A well-designed study which accurately addresses the concern that systemic IS therapy in IED may predispose to malignancy has not been conducted, and there is limited literature specific to the long-term use of IS therapy in patients with IED. Studies that have examined this important issue have a number of significant shortcomings. The study conducted by Murray et al. established that there was an increased risk of malignancy; however, the findings are affected by a number of important factors. These include a small sample size (n = 87) and failure to account for pre-exposure risk of malignancy and not addressing IED with systemic disease associations in the analysis of the results [33] . The limited patient sample size resulted in insufficient statistical power for valid conclusions to be drawn. Lane and associates did not find an increased risk of malignancy in patients treated with IS agents, but it is possible that these results were affected by the relatively short-term follow-up period (mean 1.34 years). It is evident that long-term follow up (often >5 years) is necessary in studies of patients exposed to IS therapy in order to provide a more accurate clinical picture [1, 58] . Kempen et al. suggested that systemic IS therapy does not increase the risk of cancer mortality in patients with IED [49] . The study, however, did not address the incidence of non-fatal neoplasia in patients treated with systemic IS therapy for IED. The type of malignancy, grade or histopathology for tumours was not obtained because the primary outcome of this study was defined as the cause of death on certificates identified on the US Death Index. Studies suggest that patients who develop malignancies associated with systemic IS therapy have tumours such as NMSC or lymphomas, which are treatable and may not directly increase mortality; however, they may have a significant impact on morbidity and the patient's quality of life [7, 48, 54] . Another important issue for ophthalmologists is the need for a regular, focussed and complete physical examination to ensure that the sites of common immunosuppressionrelated malignancies, such as skin, lymph nodes and cervix, are examined. This by necessity requires a careful systemic review and the assistance of other physicians, which may not be readily available in busy eye clinics.More recently developed therapeutic agents, which are increasingly utilised in the treatment of ocular inflammation, target the activity of inflammatory cells and cytokine signalling. Limited long-term data exists on whether the use of these agents alters the body's ability to detect defective or pre-cancerous cells [59] . Data with regards the safety of biologics (e.g. TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors) in the treatment of patients with IED are limited due to the recent use of these agents in this setting and a lack of long-term follow-up studies. A number of studies have highlighted the possibility of increased risk of malignancy although none of these studies involved a large patient sample with an appropriate long-term follow-up [60, 61] . Similarly, issues related to pre-exposure to MTX and other systemic IS therapy may act as confounders on data reliability.", "citance": "Kempen et al. suggested that systemic IS therapy does not increase the risk of cancer mortality in patients with IED [49] .", "claims": [{"text": "Systemic immunosuppressive (IS) therapy does not enhance the chance of cancer mortality in patients with inflammatory eye disease (IED)", "subject": "Systemic immunosuppressive (IS) therapy ", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Systemic immunosuppressive (IS) therapy increases the chance of cancer mortality in patients with inflammatory eye disease (IED)", "subject": "Systemic immunosuppressive (IS) therapy ", "is_negation": true}]}

Mutations in pivotal genes (APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2) result in the autosomal dominant form of the disease; however, the genetic cause of the majority of cases remains unexplained. Advances in genomic techniques have allowed the discovery of common variants that influence susceptibility to AD. In addition, low-frequency and rare variants in a small number of genes have emerged as important contributors of disease risk. Recent studies have focused on the epigenetic changes in affected individuals, such as DNA methylation patterns or microRNA levels, highlighting the possible involvement of these mechanisms in the etiology of AD. Here we review the known genetic and epigenetic factors underlying AD, emphasizing the molecular networks that appear to be fundamental players in its etiology.", "citation_paragraph": "Even though AD is characterized by the presence of amyloid plaques, another main pathognomonic sign is the presence of NFTs, with the hyperphosphorylated tau protein as the major component. Although mutations in MAPT gene (encoding the tau protein) have been associated with tau-related disorders, such as frontotemporal dementia, corticobasal syndrome, or supranuclear palsy, there is no apparent link between them and AD. Recently, a rare, nonsynonymous variant (p.A152T) was shown to increase the risk for AD significantly [56] , probably due to its effect in decreasing the stability of microtubules and exacerbating tau oligomerization. This finding was replicated in two independent studies, whereas the effect was found in non-APOE-e4 carriers [57, 58] .Glycogen synthase kinase 3b (GSK3b), the cyclin dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), and the regulatory proteins p35 and p39 have been recently proposed to have a pivotal role in tau phosphorylation. To date, only one extensive genetic analysis has been reported in which mutations in genes encoding Cdk5, p35, and p39 where tested in early-onset AD patients from the Netherlands [59] . Although no pathogenic mutations were found, an association between one single variant of CDK5 gene and early-onset AD was described.Genetic variants of TTBK1 (rs2651206, rs10807287, and rs7764257) have been linked with the late-onset form of AD [60] . The tau-tubulin kinase-1 encoded by this gene is partially responsible of the phosphorylation and subsequent aggregation of tau, its overexpression has been related to axonal neurodegeneration and it has a role in Cdk5/GSK3b activation. Moreover, the protein levels are increased in AD brains [60] .Another locus on chromosome 20, near the gene encoding the Cas scaffolding protein family member 4 (CASS4), reached genome-wide significance [35 \u2022\u2022 ] . Little is known about the functional role of this protein; however, it has been related to both APP pathway [35 \u2022 \u2022 ] and tau pathology, as its Drosophila melanogaster ortholog binds to CD2AP ortholog [61] . The fermitin family member 2 (encoded by FERMT2 gene) has been associated with AD. The link with tau pathology arises from a study in Drosophila melanogaster, where its ortholog was involved in toxicity mediated by tau [61] .Other AD susceptibility loci (SLC24A4/RIN3, DSG2, NME8, ZCWPW1, and CELF1) were stated in the metaanalysis performed by Lambert et al., but their role in the pathology is still difficult to elucidate [35 \u2022\u2022 ].UNC5C, PLD3, and AKAP9: New Genes Related to Alzheimer's Disease?The new genomic era has led to the discovery of genes with rare variants having a role in AD pathophysiology (i.e., TREM2, SORL1 and APP). This has opened a complete new landscape in which additional loci will probably emerge periodically. Recent examples are UNC5C, PLD3, and AKAP9.The UNC5C (unc-5 netrin receptor C) variant p.T835M has been associated with late-onset AD (OR 2.15) in a whole-exome sequencing study [62] . The p.T835M variant is associated with high levels of extracellular tau, thus suggesting a relationship with cell death in AD.A rare variant (p.V232 M) in the phospholipase D3 (PLD3) gene was related to AD through a whole-exome sequencing approach in late-onset AD families, combined with a genotyping case-control sub-study [63] . Two additional variants (p.M6R and p.A442A) were also over-represented in the affected group [63] . However, recent studies describe a lack of association between these PLD3 rare variants and AD risk [64] [65] [66] [67] . At the protein level, PLD3 has been detected in Ab plaques and it seems to indirectly interact with APP through SORL1.Two rare variants (rs144662445 and rs149979685) in AKAP9 (encoding the A-kinase anchoring protein 9) were identified in familial AD African American population. This gene is located on chromosome 7q21.2, and the main function of the AKAP9 protein is to regulate the activity of NMDA channels [68] .Because of the architecture and evolution of the human genome, with most of its variation being ancient and shared, and the majority of alleles recent and rare, replication of these new findings in different populations from shared ancestry and with well-defined phenotypes will be imperative to better define the role of these new loci in AD risk.", "citance": "T835M has been associated with late-onset AD (OR 2.15) in a whole-exome sequencing study [62] .", "claims": [{"text": "T8345M is associated with late onset Alzheimer's disease.", "subject": "T8345M", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 3308312, "title": "Reciprocal TCR-CD3 and CD4 Engagement of a Nucleating pMHCII Stabilizes a Functional Receptor Macrocomplex", "abstract": "CD4+ T cells convert the time that T cell receptors (TCRs) interact with peptides embedded within class II major histocompatibility complex molecules (pMHCII) into signals that direct cell-fate decisions. In principle, TCRs relay information to intracellular signaling motifs of the associated CD3 subunits, while CD4 recruits the kinase Lck to those motifs upon coincident detection of pMHCII. But the mechanics by which this occurs remain enigmatic. In one model, the TCR and CD4 bind pMHCII independently, while in another, CD4 interacts with a composite surface formed by the TCR-CD3 complex bound to pMHCII. Here, we report that the duration of TCR-pMHCII interactions impact CD4 binding to MHCII. In turn, CD4 increases TCR confinement to pMHCII via reciprocal interactions involving membrane distal and proximal CD4 ectodomains. The data suggest that a precisely assembled macrocomplex functions to reliably convert TCR-pMHCII confinement into reproducible signals that orchestrate adaptive immunity.", "citation_paragraph": "CD4 has long been enigmatic. Originally, it was viewed as an accessory molecule until antibody-crosslinking experiments were interpreted to mean that the TCR and CD4 physically interact; the term coreceptor was then offered to define CD4 as a component of a multi-subunit receptor complex for pMHCII in order to distinguish it from a subsidiary function such as adhesion (Janeway, 1988) . Mutagenesis data were subsequently taken as evidence for TCR-CD4 interactions (Vignali et al., 1996; Vignali and Vignali, 1999) . However, the V-like crystal structures altered this thinking since the TCR and CD4 would not directly interact (Wang et al., 2001a; Yin et al., 2012) . A model that could reconcile these discordant results was proposed whereby the TCR-CD3 complex pre-associates with the CD4 D3 and D4 domains and crosslinks one TCR-pMHCII assembly to another (Irvine et al., 2002; Krogsgaard et al., 2005) . But recent FRET and super-resolution data show that the TCR-CD3 complex and CD4 do not pre-associate in the absence of coincident pMHCII engagement or adopt the spatial relationship predicted by that model Roh et al., 2015) . Thus, fundamental questions persist regarding how CD4 fits and works within this multi-subunit molecular machine. The data presented here do not conform with expectations regarding how the TCR and CD4 should behave if they were to bind pMHCII in a V-like arch, but they are consistent with pMHCII receptor signaling having converged on a mechanism akin to cytokine signaling (Kuhns and Badgandi, 2012; Madrenas et al., 1997) . For example, binding of the cytokine-specific IL-4Ra subunit to IL-4 forms a composite docking interface to which the degenerate gc subunit binds with a higher affinity than to IL-4 alone; only then are the IL-4Ra and gc-associated Janus Kinases positioned in a spatial and temporal relationship that facilitates signaling (Wang et al., 2009) . By analogy, our data are consistent with the TCR-CD3 complex serving as a specific receptor subunit for pMHCII, while CD4 represents a degenerate subunit with no appreciable affinity for pMHCII on its own. In this scenario, the constrained docking polarity observed for TCRs on pMHCII (Rossjohn et al., 2015) results in a highly reproducible composite surface along the TCR-CD3-pMHCII axis to which CD4 would bind with higher affinity than to MHCII alone. Docking would then position Lck in the proper spatial and temporal relationship with the CD3 ITAMs to allow for phosphorylation.The most straightforward extracellular docking topology would follow an apparent shape complementarity between CD4 and the TCR-CD3-pMHCII axis ( Figure S1A ) since (1) structural data indicate that large-scale conformational changes in the TCR or CD3 ectodomains do not occur upon pMHCII or mitogenic mAb engagement; (2) experimental data point to a stable TCR-CD3 unit bound by continuous interactions between the ecto and transmembrane domains; and (3) FRET analysis indicate that CD4 is proximal to CD3d (Call et al., 2002; Ding et al., 1999; Fernandes et al., 2012; Garcia et al., 1999; Glassman et al., 2016; Kuhns and Badgandi, 2012; Kuhns and Davis, 2007; Kuhns et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2001; Xu et al., 2006 ). An alternative hypothesis, akin to the permissive geometry model, is that TCR engagement moves the CD3 ectodomains to expose a CD4 contact site on the TCR (Minguet et al., 2007) . Either way, initial CD4-MHCII interactions could allow a pivot from a V-like arch to a lower energy docked position via a ball-and-socket movement akin to the V H -C H elbow of antibodies (Lesk and Chothia, 1988) . Or, docking may occur straight away. Importantly, once docked, an additional anchor could form via intracellular interactions between Lck and the CD3 subunits (Li et al., 2017; Mingueneau et al., 2008; Xu and Littman, 1993) .Prior studies suggest that macrocomplexes form constantly, regardless of the peptide content of an MHCII, can signal in response to very weak ligands on thymocytes and that both the TCR-pMHCII dwell time and the frequency of CD4-Lck interactions influence the signaling outcome (Kao and Allen, 2005; Parrish et al., 2016; Stepanek et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2001b) . Here and elsewhere, CD4 minimally impacted agonist TCR-pMHCII interactions if only agonist pMHCII is present, indicating there is a TCR dwell time above which CD4 is more likely to cycle through these macrocomplexes than enhance TCRpMHCII dwell time (Crawford et al., 1998; Hong et al., 2015; Huppa et al., 2010; O'Donoghue et al., 2013; Stepanek et al., 2014; Wooldridge et al., 2006) . However, CD4 did influence TCR dwell time on agonist ligands diluted among null ligandsconditions that were not explored in prior studies-suggesting that CD4 can make a relevant contribution to TCR dwell time on agonist pMHCII. Our data also demonstrate that CD4 increases TCR dwell time on low-affinity pMHCII. These results are consistent with biomembrane force probe (BFP) 2D affinity measurements of the 3.L2 TCR that showed no contribution of CD4 to the agonist Hb:I-E k pMHCII, but a significant contribution to binding of an antagonist (I72) pMHCII and a trend toward significance with a weak agonist ligand (T72; p = 0.06) (Hong et al., 2015) . Importantly, we found the CD4 dwell time on pMHCII to be proportional to that of the TCR in a bulk assay, yet the CD4 t 1/2 was always faster than the TCR; therefore, the kinetics of TCRpMHCII interactions would influence the duration that a docking interface remains intact for CD4 molecules to cycle through in a processive-like manner (Stepanek et al., 2014) . By increasing TCR-CD3 dwell time on lower-affinity pMHCII, CD4 might help recruit a greater breadth of clonotypes from the CD4 + T cell repertoire that differentiate to distinct effector phenotypes Tubo et al., 2013) . This also appears likely to be key for signaling in response to the weak TCR-pMHCII interactions that drive CD4 + T cell development and homeostasis (Kao and Allen, 2005; Parrish et al., 2016; Stepanek et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2001b) . A final implication of this macrocomplex design is that it provides an explanation for how distinct constituents of the TCR repertoire can reproducibly direct the appropriate response to an immunological challenge. At issue is that if TCRs bind pMHCII in a noncanonical orientation, then the docking interface for CD4 would not be formed and any recruitment of Lck to the ITAMs by CD4 would be subject to the problems outlined above for a V-like arch with extraordinarily weak CD4-MHCII interactions. So, if two TCRs interact with the same pMHCII via the same kinetic properties but different docking modalities, then they would likely produce very different outcomes due to differences in both the spatial relationship between Lck and the ITAMs, and the duration with which they are held there. But it is now clear that there is a reliable relationship between the kinetics of TCR-pMHCII interactions and CD4 + T cell signaling, gene expression, and effector functions (Allison et al., 2016; Corse et al., 2010; Gottschalk et al., 2010; Govern et al., 2010; Kersh et al., 1998; Stepanek et al., 2014; Tubo et al., 2013; van Panhuys et al., 2014; Vanguri et al., 2013) . Since the highly ordered macrocomplex imposes uniform requirements for assembly on a diverse collection of TCRs within the repertoire, the spatial relationship between Lck and each of the ten ITAMs will always be the same for any TCR that docks appropriately, as supported by our recent FRET analysis . Consequently, the quantity and quality of ITAM phosphorylation by CD4-associated Lck would be determined strictly by the kinetic factors that influence the stability of the macrocomplex, and thus the duration of Lck proximity to any given ITAM, as suggested previously (Kersh et al., 1998) . We thus postulate that the precise assembly of this molecular machine has evolved as an equalizer that ensures a reproducible translation of information, regarding specificity at the TCR-pMHCII interface, into scalable signaling at the ITAMs; in turn, the extent of ITAM phosphorylation would determine CD4 + T cell responses (Guy et al., 2013; Holst et al., 2008; Hwang et al., 2015) . Future experiments will be required to interrogate how these molecular mechanisms influence cell-fate decisions in vivo.", "citance": "An alternative hypothesis, akin to the permissive geometry model, is that TCR engagement moves the CD3 ectodomains to expose a CD4 contact site on the TCR (Minguet et al., 2007) .", "claims": [{"text": "TCR engagement moves the CD3 ectodomains to expose a CD4 contact site on the TCR.", "subject": "TCR engagement", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 143811, "title": "DNA methylation/hydroxymethylation in melanoma", "abstract": "Melanoma is a malignant tumor of melanocytes and is considered to be the most aggressive cancer among all skin diseases. The pathogenesis of melanoma has not been well documented, which may restrict the research and development of biomarkers and therapies. To date, several genetic and epigenetic factors have been identified as contributing to the development and progression of melanoma. Besides the findings on genetic susceptibilities, the recent progress in epigenetic studies has revealed that loss of the DNA hydroxymethylation mark, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC), along with high levels of DNA methylation at promoter regions of several tumor suppressor genes in melanoma, may serve as biomarkers for melanoma. Moreover, 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine, an epigenetic modifier causing DNA demethylation, and ten-eleven translocation family dioxygenase (TET), which catalyzes the generation of 5-hmC, demonstrate therapeutic potential in melanoma treatment. In this review, we will summarize the latest progress in research on DNA methylation/hydroxymethylation in melanoma, and we will discuss and provide insight for epigenetic biomarkers and therapies for melanoma. Particularly, we will discuss the role of DNA hydroxymethylation in melanoma infiltrating immune cells, which may also serve as a potential target for melanoma treatment.", "citation_paragraph": "DNA methylation is a relatively stable and heritable epigenetic mark in several eukaryotic organisms. It is a biochemical process in which a methyl group is added to a cytosine or adenine at the 5-position on the pyrimidine ring of the methyl group where the DNA base thymine is located, converting cytosine to methylcytosine [9] . The CpG dinucleotides tend to cluster in regions called CpG islands, defined as regions of more than 200 bases with a G + C content of at least 50% and a ratio of observed to statistically expected CpG frequencies of at least 60%. Approximately 60% of gene promoters are associated with CpG islands and are normally unmethylated, although some of them (approximately 6%) become methylated in a tissue-specific manner during early development or in differentiated tissues [10] . This finding may explain why all cells in an organism share the same genetic information, but they show different phenotypes. In general, CpG island methylation is associated with gene silencing. DNA methylation serves as a mark that indicates repression of gene expression; therefore, it is involved in several biological processes, such as cell differentiation and proliferation. DNA methylation inhibits gene expression by various mechanisms. Methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) proteins, for example, can be recruited by methylated DNA; in turn, MBD family members recruit histone modifying and chromatin-remodeling complexes to the methylated sites [11] . Moreover, DNA methylation can directly inhibit transcription by precluding the recruitment of DNA-binding proteins to their target sites [12] . However, DNA methylation does not occur exclusively at CpG islands; it may also occur at CpG island shores, which refer to regions of lower densities of CpG that lie close to CpG islands and are associated with transcriptional inactivation (Figure 1 ). Most tissue-specific DNA methylation occurs not at CpG islands but at CpG island shores [13] . In mammalian cells, DNA methylation is restricted to regions of CpG islands, which are typically present in promoter regions [14] (Figure 2 ). The process of DNA methylation is mediated by methyltransferases, such as DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b, and each of them displays different functional capacities. For example, DNMT1 maintains methylation status during cell replication, whereas DNMT3a and 3b usually induce de novo methylation [15] .In contrast, DNA demethylation is a process that occurs passively, especially by the programmed failure of transmission of methylation patterns during a round of cell division, and re-activates or re-expresses silenced genes [16] . Unlike DNA methylation, DNA demethylation has been less studied, and active DNA demethylation in mammals has been recognized only recently. This process occurs through the sequential iterative oxidation of the methyl group of 5-mC and removal of the final modified group by the actions of thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) as well as the base excision repair pathway to yield cytosine from 5-mC [16] . Oxidation of 5-mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine 5-hmC is the first and most important step of this reaction, which is mediated by the TET family dioxygenase enzymes, including TET1, TET2 and TET3 [17] . 5-hmC is the most abundant intermediate of the active DNA demethylation process and acts as a positive transcriptional regulator in normal development and cancer [18] [19] , and its levels are directly correlated with the levels of differentiation in a wide variety of human tissues [20] . All three TETs can further oxidize 5-hmC to 5-formylcytosine (5-fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5-CaC), resulting in tissue levels in the order of 5-mC>5-hmC>5-fC>5-CaC [21] . Meanwhile, both formylcytosine and carboxylcytosine can be excised by TDG, which triggers subsequent base excision repair (BER), indicating a potential role for active demethylation [19, 22] (Figure 3) .Generally, 5-hmC levels are significantly lower and vary greatly depending on the cell type (0.1-0.7% of total cytosine) compared to the relatively constant levels of 5-mC in somatic tissues (3-4% of total cytosine) [23] [24] . The three TET family proteins vary in levels in different cell types. For example, TET1 and TET2 are highly expressed by embryonic stem cells and in early embryogenesis, and their levels decrease when cells exit pluripotency and undergo differentiation. TET2 is highly expressed in the hematopoietic system, while TET3 is overexpressed in germ cells/oocyte, brain tissue and more ubiquitously in somatic cells. TET proteins are responsible for generating all of the 5-hmC in the genome [25] , and the loss of TET functions may have dire biological consequences. Numerous loss-of-function mutations of tet2 have been identified in myeloid cancers where tet2 has been shown to be a key tumor suppressor. In addition, TET1 has been recently revealed to play an oncogenic role in MLL-rearranged leukemia [26] . Moreover, the loss of 5-hmC has been observed in several malignancies, such as breast cancer [27] , liver cancer [28] , and kidney cancer [29] , and has even been proposed as a prognostic marker in ovarian cancer [30] . However, if TET proteins are capable of oxidizing 5-mC to 5-CaC, the question arises as to why this reaction stops at 5-hmC and why 5-hmC is stable and abundant in the genome. Recent findings of differences among TET proteins suggest that perhaps 5-hmC and other oxidized forms may have epigenetic roles in addition to their function as DNA demethylation intermediates [31] [32] .", "citance": "TET proteins are responsible for generating all of the 5-hmC in the genome [25] , and the loss of TET functions may have dire biological consequences.", "claims": [{"text": "TET proteins are responsible for generating all 5-hmC found in the genome.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "The loss of the TET protein functions may have dire biological consequences, such as myeloid cancers.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 35905070, "title": "A new view of the beta cell", "abstract": null, "citation_paragraph": "There is a current unmet need in diabetology for a direct measure of the functional beta cell mass in patients, partly as a result of a lack of appropriate probes. In this issue of Diabetologia, Vats and colleagues describe the generation of a new antibody raised against transmembrane protein 27 (TMEM27) with promising features for use in beta cell imaging in humans [1] .Diabetes mellitus is characterised by high blood glucose levels caused by an insufficient functional beta cell mass, which is determined by the actual beta cell mass and how much insulin the beta cells produce relative to the physiological demand. Diabetes is a group of metabolic diseases with completely different aetiologies; there are three main types: type 1 diabetes is caused by autoimmune destruction of the beta cells, resulting in an absolute beta cell deficiency, whereas type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes are caused by a relative beta cell deficiency resulting from peripheral insulin resistance and inadequate beta cell function, which is followed by loss of beta cell mass in type 2 diabetes.The beta cell mass is plastic, allowing adaptation to physiological demand. For example, the pancreas is able to increase the beta cell mass during pregnancy and in obesity, at least in rodents, thus compensating for the increased demand for insulin caused by insulin resistance. Diabetes develops when this mechanism fails, and it is therefore thought that drugs that improve the capacity to expand the beta cell mass or, alternatively, prevent the loss of beta cell mass will be of great clinical importance in the treatment of diabetes. Evidence from mouse studies has suggested that, even after near complete loss of beta cells, the pancreas has the capacity to spontaneously regenerate a sufficiently large functional beta cell mass to become independent of insulin treatment [2] . Furthermore, measurable levels of circulating C-peptide, as well as pancreatic insulin-positive cells, can be found in type 1 diabetic patients, even many years after the onset of the disease [3] . This is indicative of sustained formation of new beta cells, lending hope to the notion that induction of immune tolerance could offer a potential cure for type 1 diabetes, perhaps in combination with regenerative medicine.Although beta cell mass declines in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes in humans, the process is poorly understood because only indirect means are available for estimation of the beta cell mass in vivo. These are based on correlations between functional insulin secretion measurements and beta cell mass [4] . Furthermore, establishment of the beta cell mass by morphometry on biopsies may be grossly misleading owing to the heterogeneity of islet distribution in the organ. Thus, although biopsies have greatly facilitated the study of disease progression in organs such as the skin and the kidneys, this approach is less attractive in diabetes.Alternative robust methods for determining the beta cell mass are therefore required in order to study the onset and progression of the disease, providing endpoints in clinical trials and measurements of the efficacy of novel therapies aimed at the preservation or regeneration of beta cells. It is interesting to note that animal studies have suggested that drugs that increase the level of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) signalling may in part act through a positive effect on beta cell mass [5] . Several such drugs are on the market for the treatment of diabetes, but it is unknown whether they modulate beta cell mass in humans.In vivo imaging of the pancreas and the beta cells contained therein could potentially allow the direct measurement of beta cell mass. However, although great progress has been made in medical imaging, in the form of magnetic resonance and positron emission tomography, imaging beta cells has proved to be a tremendous challenge. An inherent problem in beta cell imaging is their rarity and heterogeneous distribution in small (submillimetre) clusters throughout the pancreas, where they only constitute about 1-2% of the total organ mass.No currently available method has enough spatial resolution to image native islets in vivo and it is therefore critical to identify probes that will increase islet contrast and produce a signal proportional to islet mass. The discovery that beta cells express vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2) has prompted researchers to use one of its ligands, dihydrotetrabenazine (DTBZ), for beta cell imaging [6] . DTBZ is used clinically for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of dopaminergic neurons in the central nervous system and is the only tracer currently being clinical trialled for beta cell imaging by PET [7] . However, recent multimodal imaging has provided strong evidence that this approach may have limited use for beta cell imaging because the PET signal generated does not correlate with beta cell mass [8] . In their paper [8] the authors stipulate important directions for future preclinical evaluations of beta cell probes.A similar approach has recently demonstrated promising results for in vivo optical imaging in mice. The GLP-1 receptor agonist exendin-4 can be fluorescently conjugated and injected intravenously in mice. Owing to high levels of the GLP-1 receptor on beta cells, the probe internalises and accumulates rapidly in the beta cells, allowing in vivo monitoring of the fluorescent signal which, importantly, shows a good correlation with beta cell mass determined by stereology. Furthermore, the probe effectively demonstrates loss of beta cell mass following streptozotocin-induced diabetes [9, 10] . We have generated similar probes and have likewise observed the rapid accumulation of these in beta cells in vivo. In addition, we have demonstrated their potential for beta cell imaging by using optical projection tomography on isolated pancreases (Fig. 1) . Although optical imaging is of limited use for total pancreas imaging in humans, the demonstration of very high probe accumulation and good signal-to-background ratios indicate that further investigation of this probe for use in PET imaging is warranted.An alternative to the use of receptor/ligand pairs for probing beta cells is to use antibodies with beta cell surface reactivity and specificity. A monoclonal antibody with these characteristics (recognising an uncharacterised antigen, IC2) was generated in 1986 and was subsequently used to probe beta cells in vivo, although the analyses of specificity and correlation with beta cell mass were performed in isolated pancreases [11, 12] . The fact that this antibody is a large IgM class antibody and has a long plasma half-life is likely to reduce its application in human beta cell imaging owing to a poor signal-to-noise ratio [7] Promising probes were recently generated by panning a phage display in vivo and in vitro [13] . A single-chain antibody was identified that efficiently labels beta cells in vivo, and radiolabelling demonstrated a good correlation with beta cell mass in the isolated organ. The probe is cleared rapidly from the bloodstream and, although it was identified in a screen in rodents, the antibody also exhibits specific in situ binding to human islets. Interestingly, the antibody is internalised by beta cells. This feature is common to IC2 and exendin-4 probes and may represent an important feature required to generate sufficient label retention by target cells for imaging.In this issue of Diabetologia, Vats and colleagues [1] present a novel monoclonal antibody directed against human transmembrane protein 27 (TMEM27). TMEM27 has previously been described as a beta cell marker and proposed to be a regulator of beta cell proliferation [14, 15] . Vats et al describe the first successful generation of an antibody to a known antigen on the beta cell that has properties allowing the in vivo imaging of beta cells. On human tissue arrays containing samples of a range of abdominal organs, the new antibody specifically labelled beta cells in the pancreas and also labelled cells in the kidney, but it did not cross-react with mouse TMEM27. The authors provide evidence that INS-1E cells overexpressing human TMEM27 can be imaged with the antibody conjugated with a near-infrared fluorophore when grafted subcutaneously in nude mice. In similar subcutaneous grafts, specific radioactive uptake following i.v. administration of a radiolabelled probe could clearly be imaged by PET. More importantly, the authors were able to demonstrate that the antibody specifically targets beta cells in vivo and that it gets internalised into the beta cells, possibly allowing a better accumulation of the signal. This was demonstrated by the administration of the antibody coupled to a nearinfrared conjugate in mice in which human TMEM27 was expressed under the control of the rat insulin promoter.Taken together, this probe seems to offer an attractive new reagent for the in vivo determination of beta cell mass. However, some issues need to be addressed to truly demonstrate its potential. Since the antibody does not crossreact with mouse TMEM27, all studies were conducted using transgenic expression of the human protein. The expression levels were determined to be significantly higher than endogenous expression in human islets, and it will be important to demonstrate signal-to-noise ratios at endogenous expression levels of the target. Also, the lack of crossreactivity with the mouse protein prevented the generation of a signal in the kidneys of the transgenic mice; however, this could potentially be a problem in a clinical setting. It would be interesting to further characterise this antibody to demonstrate correlation with beta cell mass. Grafting human islets in mice is another potential way of demonstrating beta cell labelling at TMEM27 levels closer to normal. We and others have recently reported the finding and characterisation of cell surface reactive antibodies with beta cell specificity in the pancreas [16, 17] . A combination of existing probes (e.g. TMEM27 antibodies with GLP-1 receptor agonists) and novel, yet to be characterised, probes that use complementary internalisation mechanisms, could potentially improve the sensitivity in medical imaging methods.", "citance": "TMEM27 has previously been described as a beta cell marker and proposed to be a regulator of beta cell proliferation [14, 15] .", "claims": [{"text": "TMEM27 is a marker for beta cells.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

There is great interest in applying mathematical modeling approaches to cancer cell line datasets to generate network models of gene regulatory interactions.

Telomeres, the repetitive DNA repeat sequences at the end of linear eukaryotic chromosomes protecting chromosome ends from degradation and illegitimate recombination, play a crucial role in cell fate and aging. Due to the mechanism of replication, telomeres shorten as cells proliferate, which consequently contributes to cellular senescence and mitochondrial dysfunction. Cells are the basic unit of organismal structure and function, and mitochondria are the powerhouse and metabolic center of cells. Therefore, cellular senescence and mitochondrial dysfunction would result in tissue or organ degeneration and dysfunction followed by somatic aging through multiple pathways. In this review, we summarized the main mechanisms of cellular senescence, mitochondrial malfunction and aging triggered by telomere attrition. Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the aging process may elicit new strategies for improving health and extending lifespan.", "citation_paragraph": "Telomeric DNA can also recruit shelterin to protect chromosome ends. Shelterin binds specifically to telomeric DNA, which is composed of six proteins: telomeric repeat binding factor 1 (TRF1), TRF2, repressor/activator protein (RAP1), protection of telomeres protein (POT1), TRF1-interacting nuclear protein 2 (TIN2) and TIN2-and POT1-interacting protein (TPP1) (de Lange 2005a; Lazzerini-Denchi and Sfeir 2016) . In this review, we divide the function of shelterin into three categories. First, shelterin is thought to protect telomeres via affecting the structure of telomeric DNA. It is proposed that TRF2 represses the ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM)-dependent DNA damage signaling pathway and classical nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) by folding telomeric DNA into a t-loop (Benarroch-Popivker et al. 2016; Doksani et al. 2013 ). In addition, recent evidence has revealed that TRF2 and RAP1 are required to repress t-loop cleavage through preventing the activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1, one of the DDR factors) to protect telomeres from homologous recombination-mediated repair in mammals (Rai et al. 2016) . TRF2 also mediates t-loop unwinding to allow telomerase access to the chromosome end and avoid replication fork collisions in S-phase (Sarek et al. 2016) . However, uncontrolled TRF2 stimulates the invasion of TERRA into telomeric double-strand DNA, resulting in the formation of telomeric RNA-DNA hybrids (telR loops), and TRF1 can directly support end protection by restraining telR loops (Lee et al. 2018) . G4 structures are considered telomeric replication barriers, and TRF1 may remove these barriers by recruiting helicases, facilitating telomeric replication (Sfeir et al. 2009 ). Second, shelterin complexes can directly prevent telomeres from DDR. Studies have found that telomeres are likely threatened by the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related protein (ATR)-dependent DDR, even they are in the t-loop configuration, and POT1-TPP1 is required to block the activation of the ATR kinase (Kibe et al. 2016) . POT1 also contributes to telomere protection by preventing replication protein A (RPA), which is a crucial factor for the activation of ATR binding at telomeres (Zou and Elledge 2003) . As the central hub of the shelterin complex, TIN2 plays an important role in repressing ATR and ATM signaling by linking the POT1-TPP1 heterodimer and stabilizing TRF2 at the telomeres (Frescas and de Lange 2014; Hu et al. 2017; Takai et al. 2011) . Finally, shelterin is also crucial for the maintenance of telomeric DNA through modulating telomerase activity. Binding tightly to 3 0 overhangs, POT1 serves as a negative regulator of telomerase, and a current model proposed that POT1 and TPP1 compete with telomerase for access to the 3 0 telomere terminus (Kelleher et al. 2005; Lei et al. 2005; Loayza 2003 ). TINtethered TPP1 recruits both POT1 and telomerase to telomeres (Abreu et al. 2010; Nandakumar et al. 2012; Xin 2007) . TIN2 is required for the recruitment of TPP1/POT1, and telomerase decreases with knockdown of TIN2. Recent studies have suggested that TIN2 mutation decreases the frequency of telomere extension by telomerase, suggestive of a TPP1-independent role of TIN2 in telomere regulation (Frank et al. 2015; Nandakumar et al. 2012; Takai et al. 2017) . Studies have suggested that POT1-TPP1 enhances telomerase processivity. The questions remain how POT1, a negative regulator of telomerase, interacts with TPP1 to promote telomerase processivity (Latrick and Cech 2010; Wang et al. 2007) (Fig. 1 ).", "citance": "TRF2 also mediates t-loop unwinding to allow telomerase access to the chromosome end and avoid replication fork collisions in S-phase (Sarek et al. 2016) .", "claims": [{"text": "TRF2 mediates t - loop unwinding to allow telomerase access to the chromosome end.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

By 2035 it is estimated that there will be 592 million people with diabetes worldwide, increasing from 382 million in 2013 [1]. The negative impact of diabetes on the individual\u2019s quality of life has long been established [2] and the impact on economic and health resources is a substantial and growing burden [3]. There is high-quality evidence from intervention trials that healthier lifestyles can prevent or delay the onset of T2D [4]. A shift from a nutrient-based approach to one based on foods has been proposed for dietary guidelines [5], with emerging evidence for roles of certain foods in the development of T2D [6\u20138]. A \u2018food\u2019 item of particular interest is sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) [9,10], which, if found to be causally related to T2D, would offer the potential for T2D prevention by reducing or eliminating them from the diet. SSB is a collective term for soft drinks, fruit juice drinks, cordials, iced teas, sports drinks and other similar beverages, which are sweetened with caloric sugars. It has been estimated that the global consumption of soft drinks has increased from 9.5 gallons per person per year in 1997 to 11.4 gallons in 2010 [11]. Although national surveys from both the USA [12] and UK [13] have reported small decreases in SSB consumption (with the exception of a small increase in men aged \u226519 years in the UK) the contribution of SSBs to free sugar intakes is still high and concerning, as for example, SSBs are listed as the highest individual food contributor to energy intakes (5.3%) in the USA [14] and as one of the major sources of non-milk extrinsic sugar in the UK [13].", "citation_paragraph": "Further research efforts are needed to investigate the association between SSBs and T2D risk in more depth. For instance, a topical debate is the contribution of naturally occurring sugars as found in fruit juice to free sugar intakes and whether these may also contribute to diabetes onset. To overcome limitations inherent in self-reporting dietary intakes, it would of great interest to identify biomarkers that would provide objective assessment of intake. A proof-ofprinciple for a biomarker of sugar intake was previously demonstrated [23] , and further research is warranted. In terms of mechanisms, more research is needed in particular on whether the body processes liquid sugar differently to solid sugar. Not having the answers to these and other related questions, however, should not detract from the strength of the current evidence for SSBs and T2D. Further research should also focus on assessing appropriate alternatives for hydration and modeling of strategies to reduce SSBs consumption.Based on the evidence for SSB consumption and weight gain, it is widely accepted that public health strategies to reduce SSB consumption are needed. The evidence for the association of SSBs and T2D independent of adiposity adds considerable weight to the argument and highlights the urgency of developing and introducing such strategies.Taxation has been proposed as one means of reducing the intake of unhealthy food products. This, in turn, would lower healthcare costs, as well as generate revenue that can be used for health programs. SSBs have been proposed as a specific target for such a policy. Modeling approaches for the potential benefits and effectiveness of SSB taxation have shown that a tax of 20% on SSBs could reduce the prevalence of obesity in the UK by 1.3% [24] . There is a further suggestion that taxation of SSBs could avert 4.2% of prevalent overweight/obesity and 2.5% of incident T2D in India from 2014 to 2023, in both urban and rural populations [25] . Despite such economic-epidemiologic modeling, there is as yet no agreement to push a tax forward, and this remains a hotly debated issue amid calls from some quarters demanding absolute proof of a cause-effect relationship. For reasons described herein, providing such cast-iron proof is currently near impossible. Considering the abundance of evidence and support for the fulfillment of criteria for causal inference as outlined above, in the absence of absolute proof a 'best intentions/no harm' approach could be justified.Moving upstream from policies targeted at the level of the individual and to tackling the food environment opens up other plausible strategies, including limiting portion sizes and clear front of pack labeling, even considering a health warning on the sugar content of certain drinks. Engagement with industry is also pertinent and the 'responsibility deal' in England [26] is a step in the right direction.", "citance": "There is a further suggestion that taxation of SSBs could avert 4.2% of prevalent overweight/obesity and 2.5% of incident T2D in India from 2014 to 2023, in both urban and rural populations [25] .", "claims": [{"text": "Taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages raises the prevalence of obesity in India.", "subject": "Taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages reduces the prevalence of obesity in India.", "subject": "Taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages", "is_negation": false}]}

Topics discussed are (1) blastema formation by the proteolytic histolysis of limb tissues to release resident stem cells and mononucleate cells that undergo dedifferentiation, cell cycle entry and accumulation under the apical epidermal cap. (2) The origin, phenotypic memory, and positional memory of blastema cells. (3) The role played by macrophages in the early events of regeneration.

(6) Possible mechanisms of distalization during normal and intercalary regeneration. (7) Is pattern formation is a self-organizing property of the blastema or dictated by chemical signals from adjacent tissues? (8) What is the future for regenerating a human limb?", "citation_paragraph": "[3H]-thymidine labeling studies have shown that, as progenitor blastema cells are forming into an accumulation blastema, they enter the cell cycle and synthesize DNA. The pulse labeling index reaches 10%-30% during formation of the adult newt accumulation blastema (Loyd & Tassava, 1980; Mescher & Tassava, 1976) . By contrast, the mitotic index is low, between 0.1% and 0.7% (average \u223c0.4%, or 4/1000 cells) in both Ambystoma larvae (Kelly & Tassava, 1973) and adult newts. The total length of the cell cycle has been calculatd to be approximately 40 h for regenerating axolotl limbs (McCullough & Tassava, 1976 ) and 45 h for regenerating adult newt limbs (Grillo, 1971) .The fact that blastema cells synthesize DNA but divide only infrequently during formation of the accumulation blastema suggests that a large proportion of dedifferentiating cells arrest in G2 (Mescher & Tassava, 1976) . Further indirect evidence for G2 arrest is the strong upregulation of the ecotropic viral integration factor 5 (Evi5) throughout blastema formation in regenerating axolotl limbs and regenerating ear hole tissue of MRL/mpj mice (Heber-Katz et al., 2013; Rao et al., 2009 ). Evi5 is a centrosomal protein that accumulates in the nucleus during early G 1 in mammalian cells and prevents them from prematurely entering mitosis by stabilizing Emi1, a protein that inhibits cyclin A degradation by the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) (Eldridge et al., 2006) . At G2, Emi1 and Evi5 are phosphorylated by Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) and targeted for ubiquitin-driven degradation, allowing the cell to enter mitosis. Thus, high levels of Evi5 during blastema formation may restrain cells from entering mitosis until they are fully dedifferentiated and present in enough numbers to form an accumulation blastema (Rao et al., 2009) . To test this hypothesis, it will first be necessary to determine the spatiotemporal expression pattern of Emi1 and Evi5. The hypothesis predicts that these proteins would be expressed at high levels in both migrating wound epidermis (which does not divide) and the mesenchyme of the accumulation blastema, and that expression would decrease as the cells transit to a normal cell cycle during blastema growth.The signals that induce liberated cells to enter the cell cycle have been studied in detail in myotubes derived from the newt A1 cell line of myogenic precursors (Ferretti & Brockes, 1988) . Serum stimulation of A1 myotubes induces their partial dedifferentiation, as manifested by downregulation of the Myf5 gene (Imokawa, Simon, & Brockes, 2004) . A thrombin-activated factor present in the serum of all vertebrates tested thus far (Straube, Brockes, Dreschel & Tanaka, 2004; Tanaka, Gann, Gates, & Brockes, 1997) promotes progression through G 1 and S in cultured newt myotubes by activating a sustained extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) pathway that downregulates the Sox6 and p53 (tumor suppressor) proteins (Yun, Gates, & Brockes, 2013 , facilitating phosphorylation and inactivation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) to block entry into S-phase. Mouse myonuclei do not synthesize DNA in response to serum stimulation (Tanaka et al., 1997) . Newt blastema extract promotes dedifferentiation and DNA synthesis in both newt and mouse C2C12 myotubes in vitro (McGann, Odelberg, & Keating, 2001) , and mouse myonuclei will synthesize DNA if they are part of a mouse/newt heterokaryon (Velloso, Simon, & Brockes, 2001) . Yun et al. (2014) have shown that mouse myotubes briefly activate the ERK1/2 pathway, but do not sustain the activity, and thus fail to deactivate pRb. In addition, mammalian myotubes must overcome an additional block to DNA synthesis by the ARF tumor suppressor protein encoded by the ink4a locus, which is expressed only in taxa above the urodeles (Pajcini, Corbel, Sage, Pomerantz, & Blau, 2010) .Although the thrombin-activated protein is both necessary and sufficient to stimulate the entry of myonuclei into the cell cycle, it is not sufficient to drive them through mitosis, and they arrest in G 2 . Myofiber cellularization and cell cycle entry are independent of one another, since cell-cycle-inhibited myofibers implanted into newt limb blastemas break up into mononucleate cells (Velloso, Kumar, Tanaka, & Brockes, 2000) . Mitosis, however, requires mononucleate cell status. The identity of the thrombin-activated protein is unknown, although some evidence suggests that it may be a potent growth factor required in very small amounts (Straube et al., 2004) .

CLEC16A has been reported as the most likely candidate gene in the region, since it contains the most disease-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as well as an imunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif. However, here we report that intron 19 of CLEC16A, containing the most autoimmune disease-associated SNPs, appears to behave as a regulatory sequence, affecting the expression of a neighbouring gene, DEXI. The CLEC16A alleles that are protective from T1D and MS are associated with increased expression of DEXI, and no other genes in the region, in two independent monocyte gene expression data sets. Critically, using chromosome conformation capture (3C), we identified physical proximity between the DEXI promoter region and intron 19 of CLEC16A, separated by a loop of >150 kb. In reciprocal experiments, a 20 kb fragment of intron 19 of CLEC16A, containing SNPs associated with T1D and MS, as well as with DEXI expression, interacted with the promotor region of DEXI but not with candidate DNA fragments containing other potential causal genes in the region, including CLEC16A. Intron 19 of CLEC16A is highly enriched for transcription-factor-binding events and markers associated with enhancer activity. Taken together, these data indicate that although the causal variants in the 16p13 region lie within CLEC16A, DEXI is an unappreciated autoimmune disease candidate gene, and illustrate the power of the 3C approach in progressing from genome-wide association studies results to candidate causal genes.", "citation_paragraph": "Non-coding regions of DNA may impact upon expression of distant genes by acting as enhancers, requiring looping of DNA and interaction of remote regions via protein-protein contacts (24) . Although the exact mechanisms by which enhancers or suppressors mediate their effects on gene transcription are unknown, many enhancer regions contain binding sites for transcription factors and are identifiable by the presence of epigenetic histone modifications such as H3K4me1 and H3K27Ac (25, 26) . In addition, recent evidence suggests that some enhancers in non-coding parts of the genome are transcribed, by RNA polymerase II, into RNA with regulatory functions (27) (28) (29) . We, therefore, made use of publicly available genome-wide ChIP-Seq data sets from the ENCODE project (30, 31) to Fig. S3A ). Further evidence for a regulatory function of intron 19 of CLEC16A is provided by the observation that its sequence is highly conserved Figure 2 . A long-range interaction was detected between the DEXI promotor region and intron 19 of CLEC16A in an EBV-transformed B cell line (yellow), the monocyte-like line THP-1 (blue) and the lung epithelial cell line A549 (red). Chromatin was cross-linked and digested by BglII and re-ligated. The interaction frequency between (A) the DEXI promotor fragment bait or (B) the 20 kb intron 19 region bait containing rs12708716 and distal candidate fragments was determined by qPCR and normalized to control template interactions generated using PCR-digested and ligated PCR products from genomic DNA. Error bars represent the standard error of three independent PCR reactions and peaks were confirmed by sequencing of the qPCR products. The two grey dashed lines represent the location of the DEXI promotor region and the region of intron 19 shown to interact with the DEXI promotor region. between mouse and humans, consistent with an important regulatory function in both species.

We also note that, according to ENCODE ChIP-Seq data from human cell lines, both the interacting region in intron 19 and the DEXI promoter region share binding sites for several transcription factors ( Fig. 3A and B) including NF-kB, JunD and c-Myc. Furthermore, as might be predicted by recent work (29) , clear RNA-polymerase-II-binding peaks are evident within the fragment of intron 19 of CLEC16A containing the putative enhancer region (Fig. 3B) .

During these reactions, SSB binds to and protects susceptible ssDNA from nucleolytic digestion and chemical attacks and also prevents secondary structure formation [5] . Many but not all bacterial and human mitochondrial SSBs are active as homotetramers [5] [6] [7] , in which four oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding folds (OB folds) form a DNA-binding domain [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . However, SSB from the bacterial phylum Deinococcus-Thermus functions as a homodimer, in which each monomer contains two OB folds linked by a conserved spacer sequence [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] .

{"s2orc_id": 4863857, "title": "The Microbiome in Visceral Medicine: Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Obesity and Beyond", "abstract": "It has become increasingly evident over the past two decades that the microbiota plays a nurturing role in the development of the immune system. This appears to be important since the amplitude of immune responses has a crucial regulatory function in homeostasis and the prevention of unwanted inflammation. Hence, a malfunctioning gut flora has been shown to play a key role in visceral medicine. Strong evidence demonstrates for example that intestinal inflammation can develop as a result of a dysregulated microbiota, deficient antimicrobial responses, and aberrant bacterial translocation into the bowel wall. In healthy individuals, the bacterial translocation is blocked by a single layer of highly specialized intestinal epithelial cells which forms a strong barrier that lines the gut wall. This structure is responsible for an efficient absorption of nutrients while keeping the luminal flora at bay. In susceptible individuals, for yet incompletely understood reasons, either defective epithelial barrier function or dysregulated microbial composition or microbial pathogens drive intestinal inflammation. Many therapeutic strategies focusing on the modulation of the microbiota have been proposed recently but future research including prospective human studies and gnotobiotic mouse models are still needed to evaluate the contribution and potential therapeutic value of individual bacteria to human health.", "citation_paragraph": "Currently, the number of susceptibility genes for IBD has surpassed 200 [68] [69] [70] . The vast majority of them (e.g. CARD9, IL10, IL23R, JAK2, TNFSF15) are implicated in mucosal barrier function, microbial recognition, antimicrobial defense, mucus production, immune regulation, or restitution after injury. As such, dysregulated antimicrobial responses to commensals or the appearance of dysbiosis as a direct consequence of genetic alterations might cause IBD [15, [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] .In 2001, work from two independent groups described NOD2/ CARD15 as the first genetic risk locus for CD [72, 73] . NOD represents one of a series of intracellular innate immune receptors implicated in microbial recognition. There is an increased risk (up to 20 times in homozygous NOD2 carriers) to develop IBD, and mice with Nod2 deletion had increased susceptibility to intestinal inflammation. Importantly, the inflammatory phenotype in these mice could be rescued by housing them in a germ-free environment underlying the intimate relation between genetic predisposition and microbiota (reviewed in [12, 15] ). It was later found that Nod2 is required for the regulation of commensal microbiota in the intestine and Nod2-deficient mice harbored increased loads of commensals. Moreover, these mice had a significantly delayed clearance of the opportunistic pathogen H. hepaticus as compared to wild-type mice which resulted in the break-down of intestinal homeostasis [74] . Mechanistically, NOD2 might negatively regulate excessive toll-like receptor activation by inducing adequate low-intensity innate immune responses upon bacterial dipeptide peptidoglycan recognition. In contrast, mutated NOD2 variants would result in hyperactivation of e.g. NF-\u03baB pathway and dysregulated immune responses [75, 76] . An alternative explanation suggested that bacterial phagocytosis might be defective in mutated NOD2 variants [77] . Yet another hypothesis is that defective NOD2 impairs \u03b1-defensins production by Paneth cells which would in turn compromise antimicrobial responses in the gut. In any case, flawed bacterial recognition and handling might result in intestinal barrier defects and the chronic exposure of commensals to the underlying immune system. In this context, CD patients with ileal lesions show compromised Paneth cell-related antimicrobial defense [78] , and Paneth cell death has also been related to persistent inflammation in CD patients and experimental colitis models [79] . A recent study from our group found that mice lacking caspase-8 specifically in their intestinal epithelial cells developed spontaneous ileitis. The most striking phenotype of these mice was the lack of Paneth cells and the reduced number of goblet cells, suggesting once again that a defect in the innate immune response is driving intestinal inflammation [79] . Whereas Paneth cell dysfunction clearly modulates microbiota composition and function, the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. It has been suggested that an altered production of antimicrobial peptides might induce dysbiosis in the gut by enabling for example the direct contact of luminal components with the epithelium. Barrier integrity could also be affected by Paneth cell dysfunction since these cells contribute to the maintenance of its integrity by providing nutrients/signals to the stem cell niche. Moreover, impaired production of trefoil factor 3, which contributes to the structural integrity to the mucus [80] , or deficient mucus production as observed in Muc2 -/-mice favor epithelial barrier dysfunction. This in turn could be followed by the uncontrolled activation of lamina propria immune cells which amplifies local immune responses and induces even more epithelial cell death, perpetuating a vicious cycle.As another example, mice lacking NF-\u03baB essential modulator specifically in epithelial cells presented spontaneous, TNF-\u03b1-driven apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells which resulted in altered barrier function and microbial-induced severe pancolitis [81] . Extending these studies, it has been recently shown that the NF-\u03baB essential modulator gene prevents intestinal inflammation by inhibiting receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 kinase activity-mediated epithelial cell death, suggesting that inhibition of this kinase could be used in treating patients with NF-\u03baB essential modulator gene mutations [82] .Another single nucleotide polymorphism conferring increased susceptibility to CD is the autophagy gene ATG16L1 [71] . Defective autophagy has been associated with impaired Paneth cell function in both mice and humans [83] . The authors of this study made the unexpected observation of a gain of function specific to ATG16L1-deficient Paneth cells which led to various modifications in the secretory functions that resulted in increased peroxisome signaling and lipid metabolism which promoted inflammation. It has been proposed that by interfering with autophagy, intracellular bacteria cannot be efficiently eliminated, thus perpetuating the immune activation.In summary, genetic alterations surely contribute to IBD pathogenesis, but further research is needed for definitive answers on how genetic defects result in microbiota alterations in intestinal inflammation.", "citance": "Extending these studies, it has been recently shown that the NF-\u03baB essential modulator gene prevents intestinal inflammation by inhibiting receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 kinase activity-mediated epithelial cell death, suggesting that inhibition of this kinase could be used in treating patients with NF-\u03baB essential modulator gene mutations [82] .Another single nucleotide polymorphism conferring increased susceptibility to CD is the autophagy gene ATG16L1 [71] .", "claims": [{"text": "The NF-\u03baB essential modulator gene induces intestinal inflammation by promoting receptor-interacting protein (RIP) kinase 1 kinase activity-mediated epithelial cell death.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "The NF-\u03baB essential modulator gene prevents intestinal inflammation by inhibiting receptor-interacting protein (RIP) kinase 1 kinase activity-mediated epithelial cell death.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Is the HCV RNA in viral nucleocapsids the first RIG-I ligand, similar to influenza A virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, and bunyaviruses? (See Ref. [34] .) Or is some level of HCV RNA replication a prerequisite for RIG-I sensing, as has been proposed for some aspects of influenza A virus sensing by RIG-I? (See Refs. [35] and [36] .)When the HCV PAMP binds to RIG-I, it promotes a RIG-I conformational change that relieves the autorepression formed through the C-terminal domain [16, 22] to promote its activation and oligomerization [16, 37] . The crystal structures of RIG-I have shown that this conformational change following 5\u2032-ppp or dsRNA binding allows the helicase domain to make direct contacts with viral RNA [38] [39] [40] , possibly scanning the PAMP via ATP hydrolysis [41] for specific activating sequences, such as the poly U/UC tract found in HCV RNA. This conformational change in RIG-I releases the CARD domains for ubiquitination by TRIM25 [42] and interaction with 14-3-3\u03b5 to promote association with intracellular membranes [43] for translocation to the mitochondrial-associated endoplasmic reticulum membrane [mitochondrial-associated membrane (MAM)] [44] to interact with mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), the RIG-I signaling adaptor protein. This interaction of RIG-I with MAVS results in assembly of a signalosome complex that activates effector molecules, including the transcription factors IRF3 and NF\u03baB, to drive downstream innate immune signaling.The PRR MDA5 is also a sensor of RNA virus infection and in many ways quite similar to RIG-I; it has an equivalent domain architecture with two N-terminal CARD domains, a central DExD/H box RNA helicase domain, and a C-terminal domain [45] . To date, there is no described role for MDA5 in sensing of HCV RNA, but it is quite possible that it could play a role in the antiviral response triggered by HCV infection. Similar to RIG-I, MDA5 also signals through MAVS to drive innate immune signaling. However, MDA5 does have a distinct role from RIG-I in the antiviral response [46] . The viral ligand for MDA5 is long higher-order dsRNA or dsRNA replication intermediates [21, [47] [48] [49] [50] . Interestingly, during infection of West Nile virus, an RNA virus also in the Flaviviridae, both RIG-I and MDA5 contribute to the antiviral response. In this case, RIG-I is important early after infection, while MDA5 is important for signaling during later times of infection [51] . It may be that innate immune signaling to HCV is orchestrated in a similar fashion, with differing contributions of RIG-I and MDA5 to the antiviral response via sensing of different PAMPs presented at different times by HCV as it establishes a productive infection. While in vitro transcribed HCV RNA itself does not require MDA5 to activate signaling to IFN-\u03b2 [28] , dsRNA replicative intermediates of HCV that accumulate at later times during infection could be bona fide MDA5 ligands. Importantly, expression of the paramyxovirus V protein, known to block MDA5 signaling, can enhance HCV replication, strongly suggesting a role for MDA5 in antiviral immunity to HCV during a productive infection [52] .", "citance": "The PRR MDA5 is also a sensor of RNA virus infection and in many ways quite similar to RIG-I; it has an equivalent domain architecture with two N-terminal CARD domains, a central DExD/H box RNA helicase domain, and a C-terminal domain [45] .", "claims": [{"text": "The PPR MDA5 has twenty N-terminal CARD domains.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "The PPR MDA5 has two N-terminal CARD domains.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "The PRR MDA5 has a C-terminal domain.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "The PRR MDA5 has a central DExD/H RNA helices domain.

In this study, differences and interactions among SNF4 (encoding for the regulatory subunit of Snf1 kinase) overexpression and REG1 and REG2 (which encodes for the regulatory subunits of the type I protein phosphatase) deletions in maltose metabolism of baker\u2019s yeast were investigated using various mutants. Results revealed that SNF4 overexpression and REG1 and REG2 deletions effectively alleviated glucose repression at different levels, thereby enhancing maltose metabolism and leavening ability to varying degrees. SNF4 overexpression combined with REG1/REG2 deletions further enhanced the increases in glucose derepression and maltose metabolism. The overexpressed SNF4 with deleted REG1 and REG2 mutant \u0394REG1\u0394REG2 + SNF4 displayed the highest maltose metabolism and strongest leavening ability under the test conditions. Such baker\u2019s yeast strains had excellent potential applications.", "citation_paragraph": "The glucose effect is a global regulatory system in yeast for controlling the carbon-source utilization [14] . Strengthening the Snf1 kinase effects by elevating the expression level of the Snf1 complex and relieving the dephosphorylation caused by protein phosphatases are promising methods to weaken the glucose effect in yeast.In this study, the overexpression of SNF4 and/or the deletions of REG1 and/or REG2 positively affected the maltose metabolism and leavening ability of baker's yeast, indicating that the modification of the regulatory subunits of Snf1 kinase and PP1 phosphatase was potent to alleviate the glucose repression and improve the utilization of carbon sources that were less preferred than glucose. The effective glucose and MAL gene derepression by these mutations could facilitate a rapid transition from glucose to maltose metabolism and an efficient maltose hydrolysis, resulting in enhanced maltose metabolism and leavening ability in lean dough. The increases in maltose metabolism and dough-leavening ability largely depends on the derepression level. The seven mutants carrying different modifications displayed diverse increases in time span and MAL mRNAs, thereby improving the maltose metabolism and leavening ability to vary degrees. The regulatory subunit Snf4 is essential in expressing a functionally active kinase [4] . The formation of phosphataseresistant conformation of Snf1 benefits from binding Snf4 with AMP or ADP to protect Snf1 from dephosphorylation and promote glucose derepression [8] . Our results showed that the overexpression of SNF4 effectively alleviated the glucose repression of maltose metabolism. These findings confirmed that Snf4 played an important role in response to the glucose repression regulated by Snf1 kinase. However, some degree of Snf1 phosphorylation regulated by glucose was independent of the Snf4 subunit [6, 22] . Therefore, the overexpression of SNF4 was inferior to REG1 deletion in relieving the glucose repression. The SNF4 overexpression strain B + SNF4 showed similar glucose utilization pattern to the parental strain BY14\u03b1 in the maltose-glucose condition, but the strain B + SNF4 exhibited rapid glucose utilization at initial stage of 40 g/L of glucose (Fig. S4 in Supplementary material). Then, the promotion effect gradually weakened and the glucose utilization of the parental strain was accelerated. No obvious changes of the glucose utilization efficiencies of the two strains were observed in the last 30 min (when the concentration of glucose was below 8 g/L). Moreover, the similar trend of glucose utilization found in SNF4 overexpression was kept with REG1 and/or REG2 deleted from the chromosome. Deletion of REG1 and/ or REG2 did not obviously affect the glucose utilization in the whole process, suggesting that Snf1 complex serves as a regulator of carbon and energy metabolism [34] .The regulation by PP1 accompanied with its regulatory subunits is an important glucose-repressed step through the dephosphorylation of Snf1 kinase [27] . The regulatory subunits control the PP1 activity toward specific substrates. In this study, REG1 and REG2 deletions relieved the glucose repression and improved the maltose metabolism at different levels. The single-gene deletion of REG2 was inferior to the single-gene deletion of REG1 for the increased maltose metabolism and leavening ability caused by the enhanced MAL expression levels. This result was consistent with the finding of Castermans et al. [2] , who reported that the Reg1-Glc7 interaction was responsible for the main glucose repression pathway, and that the absence of Reg2 partially reduced the activation of Glc7 in the dephosphorylation of Snf1 fleeing from derepression. Compared with REG1 single-gene mutant \u0394REG1, slight increases of glucose derepression and maltose metabolism were observed in the double-gene deletion of REG1 and REG2 strain \u0394REG1\u0394REG2 in batch cultivation, demonstrating the overlapping function of Reg1 and Reg2 [7, 8] .The glucose regulation of the Snf1-Mig1 pathway depends on the balance between Snf1 activation and dephosphorylation [8] . Further elevation of the MAL derepression caused by the overexpression of SNF4 with deleted REG1 and/or REG2 further increased the maltose metabolism and leavening ability of baker's yeast. The overexpression of SNF4 with deleted REG1 was less efficient than that with deleted REG2 in enhancing the maltose metabolism in the test condition. Reg1 plays dual roles in activating Snf1 [27] . The regulation of Snf1 by Reg1 occurs via a complex dynamic competition in binding to Reg1 between Glc7 and Snf1 [31] . At high-glucose levels, Reg1-Glc7 promotes the Snf1 dephosphorylation, whereas Reg1 could protect the phosphorylated Snf1 in a decreasing glucose condition [28] . By contrast, Reg2 interacts with Snf1 in a phosphorylateddependent manner [21] . At this time, Reg2 simply contributed to the dephosphorylation without competition of Glc7 and Snf1. Therefore, a greater increase in glucose derepression in the mutant \u0394REG2 + SNF4 could generate a higher maltose metabolism and leavening ability than that in the mutant \u0394REG1 + SNF4.The REG1 and/or REG2 deletions exhibited different growth characteristics in the test condition (Table 3 ). The deletion of REG1 negatively affected the specific growth rate and biomass yield of baker's yeast, whereas the deletion of REG2 had no obvious impact. These findings revealed that the dephosphorylation substrate was specific for the growth-related targets of Reg1-Glc7 and Reg2-Glc7. The double-gene deletion of REG1 and REG2 conferred a severe inferiority of growth. It is probably due to the failure of PP1 to dephosphorylate substrates, which are important for growth regulation [7] . Further studies are needed to address the underlying mechanism involving Reg1 and Reg2 in growth regulation.", "citance": "Deletion of REG1 and/ or REG2 did not obviously affect the glucose utilization in the whole process, suggesting that Snf1 complex serves as a regulator of carbon and energy metabolism [34] .The regulation by PP1 accompanied with its regulatory subunits is an important glucose-repressed step through the dephosphorylation of Snf1 kinase [27] .", "claims": [{"text": "The Snf1 complex regulates carbon and energy metabolism in baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae).", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

An inherent challenge in many of these strategies is the lack of cell-surface markers permitting isolation and characterization of specific cell types from differentiating stem cell populations. Here we introduce an iterative proteomics procedure allowing tag-free isolation of cell types based on their function. Our method detects and associates specific cell-surface markers with particular cell functionality by coupling cell capture on antibody arrays with immunofluorescent labeling. Using this approach in an iterative manner, we discovered marker combinations capable of enriching for discrete pancreatic cell subtypes from human islets of Langerhans: insulin-producing beta cells (CD9high/CD56+), glucagon-producing alpha cells (CD9-/CD56+) and trypsin-producing acinar cells (CD9-/CD56-). This strategy may assist future beta cell research and the development of diagnostic tools for diabetes. It can also be applied more generally for function-based purification of desired cell types from other limited and heterogeneous biological samples.", "citation_paragraph": "Pancreatic beta cells regulate metabolic homeostasis by controlled secretion of insulin; impaired beta cell function leads to persistently elevated levels of blood glucose, the hallmark of diabetes. Cell replacement therapy is considered a promising approach towards curing diabetes [1, 2] , but it is currently limited by a severe shortage of donor tissue. This has motivated approaches capable of in vitro generation of functional insulin-producing cells [3] [4] [5] [6] . However, the lack of identified, cell type-specific surface markers is a major obstacle for isolation of relevant cells.Although a number of cell-surface markers have been correlated with endocrine pancreas cells, these typically show limited selectivity for specific endocrine cell types [7, 8] . While the transmembrane protein TMEM27 is selectively expressed in human beta cells, its extracellular domain is cleaved in these cells [9] , and it is not clear whether antibodies to this protein can be used to purify beta cells by flow cytometry or otherwise [10] . Other methods of beta cell enrichment are based on genetic marking [11] , Newport green dye labeling [12] , elimination of duct cells [7] and generation of hybridoma-derived antibodies enriching for different endocrine and non-endocrine cell types [13] . None of these techniques, however, relies on beta cellspecific surface markers, and isolated cell populations currently exhibit an unknown degree of heterogeneity. The same lack of marker information applies to other endocrine subsets in human pancreas (alpha cells, delta cells etc.).The difficulty of identifying cell type-selective surface markers in limited heterogeneous samples impedes research and medical applications in many other fields. This has motivated the use of various methods for identifying cell-surface markers. Traditional methods were based on flow cytometry [14] [15] [16] , analysis of gene expression patterns [17, 18] and immunostaining [19, 20] . Higher throughput proteomics approaches used antibody arrays for profiling cell-surface markers [21] and for discriminating cell populations based on differentially expressed markers [22] . These platforms are very efficient for identifying surface markers in a population of cells, but are insufficient for revealing association of specific markers with a particular cell type. There is therefore a great need for robust screening procedures capable of identifying markers designating cells of desired type or function. Since tissue samples are often limited in quantity and availability, such procedures should permit functional analysis of multiple markers in parallel using small numbers of cells.Here we introduce an iterative and robust high throughput screen capable of identifying and associating multiple cell-surface markers with functional cell-specific properties, such as insulin and glucagon production. The technique, termed Functional Cell Capture Screen (FCCS), allows highly efficient and rapid screening of cell type-specific markers in limited and heterogeneous samples. We demonstrate the efficiency and specificity of this approach by identifying novel markers enriching for beta, alpha, delta and acinar cells from cadaveric samples of human pancreatic islets of Langerhans.

Furthermore, an updated meta-analysis was conducted. The polymorphisms were genotyped in 328 Chinese RA patients and 449 healthy controls. Studies examining the association of TRAF1/C5 rs10818488 and/or rs3761847 polymorphism with RA were exhaustively searched. No significant difference in either genotype or allele distribution between RA patients and controls was found. The updated meta-analysis was conducted based on 19 articles including the present study. A significant association of RA with TRAF1/C5 rs10818488 polymorphism G allele in Europeans (OR = 0.843, 95% CI = 0.730-0.975, p = 0.021) and in Asians (OR = 1.070, 95% CI = 1.009-1.136, p = 0.024) was found.

Only a borderline significant association of RA with TRAF1/C5 rs3761847 polymorphism A allele was found in Europeans. Non-significant associations of RA with TRAF1/C5 rs10818488 and rs3761847 polymorphisms were found in our study. The updated meta-analysis results demonstrate that TRAF1/C5 rs10818488 polymorphism is associated with RA in Europeans, Asians and Africans, and TRAF1/C5 rs3761847 polymorphism is associated with RA in Europeans with borderline significant evidence.", "citation_paragraph": "The present study (2017) genetic polymorphisms are involved in the genetic background of RA among different ethnic populations. In the present study, we first determined whether the TRaF1/C5 rs10818488 and rs3761847 polymorphisms were associated with RA in a Chinese population, then conducted an updated meta-analysis to combine the results from different studies to re-summarize the effect sizes. However, non-significant evidence for the associations of TRaF1/C5 rs10818488 and rs3761847 polymorphisms with RA was detected in our study population. Emerging evidence suggests that RA is a heterogeneous disease with a significant discrepancy in the phenotype as demonstrated by differences in autoantibody positivity, and it has been accepted that the anti-CCP/RF-positive RA patients and anti-CCP/ RF-negative RA patients have different genetic architectures [52] . Thus, the relationships between TRaF1/C5 rs10818488 and rs3761847 polymorphisms and different serotypes of RA patients were also evaluated, whereas non-significant evidence was found.In 2007, in view of the functions of C5 and TRaF1, which are encoded by immune-related genes and adjacent to each other on chromosome 9q33-34, Kurreeman et al. selected the TRaF1/C5 genes as candidate genes for RA and performed a multitiered case-control study, and the peak evidence for association was detected from the rs10818488 polymorphism surpassing the genome-wide significance level, which is located in the intergenic region between C5 and TRaF1 [6] . In order to investigate the potential functional effect of the rs10818488 polymorphism, they scanned for transcription factor binding sites, and this polymorphism was found to be a potential binding site for EP300, a histone acetyltransferase that regulates transcription via chromatin remodeling. Thus, the rs10818488 polymorphism may be involved in the regulation of the neighboring TRaF1 and/or C5 gene [6] . Afterwards, another study found a significant difference between risk allele carriers and non-carriers of rs10818488 for the expression level of TRaF1 in phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated lymphoblastoid cell lines, indicating this polymorphism might be involved in the pathogenesis of RA through regulating the expression of TRaF1 under certain stimulation signals [30] . Subsequently, many studies have been performed to evaluate the association between TRaF1/C5 rs10818488 polymorphism and RA in different ethnic populations, whereas the results were inconsistent. In the current study, no significant evidence was detected for difference in either genotype or allele distribution between RA patients and healthy controls, and our results were consistent with Liang et al. [23] , another study performed in Chinese population.In addition to the rs10818488 polymorphism, the rs3761847 polymorphism, also located in the intergenic region between C5 and TRaF1, was found to be associated with RA reaching a genome-wide level of significance from a GWAS [7] . Notably, a recent study has revealed a possible mechanism by which the TRaF1/C5 rs3761847 polymorphism contributed to RA [53] . In that study, the monocytes from healthy human subjects with the homozygotes of risk allele of rs3761847 was found to express less TRAF1 protein but greater amounts of inflammatory cytokines in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Further experiments showed that the TRAF1 MATH domain could bind directly to the linear ubiquitination (LUBAC) complex, and interfere with the recruitment and linear ubiquitination of NEMO, resulting in decreased NF-\u03baB activation and cytokine production. In addition, TRaF1-/-mice showed increased susceptibility to LPS-induced septic shock. All these findings provided a mechanistic explanation for the increased inflammation caused by RA-associated rs3761847 polymorphism [53] . Similar to the rs10818488 polymorphism, the rs3761847 polymorphism has also attracted attention and many studies have been performed to test the relationship between the rs3761847 polymorphism and genetic susceptibility to RA. In our study, we also did not find significant evidence for the association between this polymorphism and RA, and our results were consistent with Danoy et al. [27] , another study performed in Chinese population. However, a significant association was found in another study performed in Chinese population by Zhu et al. [29] , and the estimated effect size for allelic comparison was moderate (OR = 1.28).Although we did not find significant associations of RA with the TRaF1/C5 rs10818488 and rs3761847 polymorphisms, it should be noted that the non-significant results might be owing to the relatively lower power caused by a small sample size or the \"winner's curse\" [54] -an overestimation of the true effect in the positive report accounting for the lack of power.Despite the associations between TRaF1/C5 rs10818488 and rs3761847 polymorphisms and RA have been assessed in different ethnic populations, the results are controversial, and this discrepancy might be attributed to many factors including different sample sizes, genetic backgrounds and clinical heterogeneity, etc. Meta-analysis is a useful tool to combine the results on the same topic to get a pooled estimation with an increased statistical power [40] . Although some meta-analyses on the relationships of TRaF1/C5 rs10818488 and rs3761847 polymorphisms with RA have been reported [41] [42] [43] [44] , some additional studies on this topic have been reported in recent years. Thus, we performed this updated meta-analysis to re-evaluate whether the TRaF1/C5 rs10818488 and rs3761847 polymorphisms are associated with the genetic predisposition to RA and to re-summarize the effect sizes of these polymorphisms associated with RA.Our overall meta-analysis results revealed that non-significant association of the TRaF1/C5 rs10818488 polymorphism G allele with RA was detected. Since heterogeneity was found in the overall meta-analysis of the TRaF1/ C5 rs10818488 polymorphism G allele with RA susceptibility, we performed stratified meta-analysis by ethnicity, and the heterogeneity disappeared in the subgroup analysis of Asians but remained significant in Europeans and Africans, and a significant association of RA and TRaF1/C5 rs10818488 polymorphism G allele was observed in Europeans and Asians. Notably, the TRaF1/C5 rs10818488 polymorphism G allele was found to be a protective allele in Europeans, but a risk allele in Asians. This might be due to the genetic heterogeneity between Europeans and Asians, and this might also be caused by chance. Thus, further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to clarify whether the TRaF1/C5 rs10818488 polymorphism G allele is associated with RA with the opposite direction in different ethnic populations. Non-significant evidence for association between RA and the TRaF1/C5 rs10818488 polymorphism G allele under the dominant model and recessive model was found in the overall metaanalysis. There was also significant heterogeneity when the overall meta-analysis of the association between RA and the TRaF1/C5 rs10818488 polymorphism G allele under different genetic models was performed, so subgroup meta-analysis stratified by ethnicity was conducted, and the results showed that a significant association was found for the association of RA with the TRaF1/C5 rs10818488 polymorphism G allele under the recessive model in Asians and Africans. Our updated meta-analysis indicated that the TRaF1/C5 rs10818488 polymorphism is involved in the genetic background of RA in Asians, Europeans and Africans.The overall meta-analysis did not reveal significant association between RA and the TRaF1/C5 rs3761847 polymorphism A allele under allelic contrast, dominant model and recessive model. Heterogeneity was detected for the association of RA with the TRaF1/C5 rs3761847 polymorphism A allele under allelic contrast and recessive model in the overall meta-analysis. When the results were pooled according to the ethnicity, the heterogeneity remained significant in the subgroup analysis of Europeans and Asians. In the subgroup meta-analysis stratified by ethnicity, only board-line significant evidence was found for the association of RA with TRaF1/C5 rs3761847 polymorphism A allele under allelic contrast. Thus, the present updated meta-analysis showed that the TRaF1/C5 rs3761847 polymorphism might be involved in the genetic background of RA in Europeans.Several limitations of the present study should be acknowledged. First, the sample size of our case-control study is not large enough, leading to a relatively lower power to detect associations with moderate effect sizes. Second, age and gender were imbalanced between RA patients and controls in the present study, whereas the logistic regression model with the adjustment of age and sex was employed to overcome this limitation. Third, significant heterogeneity was found among several comparisons, which might distort the meta-analysis. Finally, this meta-analysis was performed based on uncorrected estimate; if the potential confounding factors, such as age, sex, clinical characteristic, and environmental factors were available, a more precise meta-analysis could be conducted to obtain reliable results.In conclusion, we did not find significant evidence for associations of RA with TRaF1/C5 rs10818488 and rs3761847 polymorphisms in the present study. The updated meta-analysis results demonstrate that the TRaF1/C5 rs10818488 polymorphism is involved in the genetic susceptibility of RA in Asians, Europeans and Africans, and the TRaF1/C5 rs3761847 polymorphism is associated with genetic susceptibility to RA in Europeans with borderline significant evidence.", "citance": "Thus, the rs10818488 polymorphism may be involved in the regulation of the neighboring TRaF1 and/or C5 gene [6] .", "claims": [{"text": "The TRaF1/C5 rs10818488 allele polymorphism regulates the neighboring C5 gene.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "The TRaF1/C5 rs10818488 allele polymorphism regulates the neighboring TRaF1 gene.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

However, this information is also subject to its own biases, including latency, high cost, contributor biases, and imprecise resolution. Simultaneously, new technologies including Internet and mobile phone based tools, now enable information to be garnered directly from individuals at the point of care. Here, we consider how these crowdsourced data offer the opportunity to fill gaps in and augment current epidemiological models. Challenges and methods for overcoming limitations of the data are also reviewed. As more new information sources become mature, incorporating these novel data into epidemiological frameworks will enable us to learn more about infectious disease dynamics.", "citation_paragraph": "Although considered \"gold standards,\", the prerequisite acquisition, aggregation, and validation steps in traditional clinical data sets naturally incur limitations. For example, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance system has been the primary metric for measuring national influenza activity. Yet because of differences in laboratory practices and patient populations seen by different providers, comparison of the CDC data between regions and across seasons is not straightforward [16] . Furthermore, temporal trends in the CDC data can be driven by multiple factors that are difficult to disentangle (Fig. 1) ; during holiday weeks, there could be a higher percentage of ILI visits based on increased disease activity and/or changes in health-seeking behavior, since there are fewer patient visits to sentinel sites overall at these times [17] .On an international scale, the World Health Organization (WHO) field reports of infectious disease outbreaks come from technical institutions and organizations that have the capacity to contribute to international outbreak alert and response. The WHO's network provides some access to information from affected regions but is limited to organizationally obtained information and their reach [18] . Additionally, the data collection process can be affected by unequal selection whereby larger outbreaks are more likely to be detected, so that estimates of transmissibility may be biased upward [19] . Filling some of these gaps, news media have proven useful, in aggregate, for providing early information of epidemiological value for population-level disease surveillance and have decreased time to outbreak detection substantially [20] . More than 60 % of all initial outbreak reports come from unofficial informal sources, such as news media [21] . However, Internet-based news is also subject to distinct limitations based on credibility, detection speed, reach to isolated populations, and geographic coverage of areas where media are restricted or limited. Figure 2 demonstrates the differences in these data sources, illustrating HealthMap [22] disease alerts by continent from 2006 to 2009, in contrast to WHO disease reports for the same time period. These pervasive limitations of current data sources hinder our understanding of disease dynamics. For instance, seasonality of infection risk in malaria is poorly understood [23] , and domestically, we have weak understanding of temporal and spatial variation in influenza incidence as described above.Crowdsourcing offers a real-time picture of disease by harnessing information as individuals are diagnosed or even before [8, 24] . These temporal advantages are especially vital since increased ease of mobility decreases the time for infectious diseases to spread globally to the scales of hours or minutes, much quicker than even the serial interval of many diseases [25] . Additionally, these tools can spatially augment information in places that current surveillance sites do not cover [9, 26] . Another benefit of working directly with the public is that it augments engagement and enables individuals to become more aware of and involved in their own health, as anecdotal evidence has shown [10] . Thus, this approach can provide an avenue for targeted health education and rapidly measuring responses to public health interventions. Finally, through crowdsourcing infectious disease information, we can learn about aspects of disease dynamics that are not accessible through traditional data, such as contact patterns and aspects of the social environment [27, 28] . Simultaneously, crowdsourced data present their own challenges. There are issues of validation, which current studies are addressing by bringing reported data together with diagnostic or other clinical measures, such as emergency room crowding [29] . Additionally, low specificity, 1\u2212 p(false alarm), can result from confounding factors such as media events [9, 30] or demographic biases [31, 32] . Although more work is needed, some studies have uncovered demographic or temporal factors shaping use of the tools [30] [31] [32] .Every data source includes biases and challenges that must be robustly understood before the data can be used to study disease dynamics. Further studies of crowdsourced data should continue to focus on addressing issues of population representativeness, reporting bias, and validation in order to demonstrate how the data can be used as a complement to existing epidemiological sources. As crowdsourcing data types and sources become more ubiquitous, we expect these data to serve as a vital component of global disease surveillance efforts.", "citance": "Additionally, the data collection process can be affected by unequal selection whereby larger outbreaks are more likely to be detected, so that estimates of transmissibility may be biased upward [19] .", "claims": [{"text": "The World Health Organization's (WHO) data collection process is biased downward by unequal selection of larger outbreaks.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "The World Health Organization's (WHO) data collection process is biased upward by unequal selection of larger outbreaks.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo studies, we found that overexpression of YAP1, a key effector in the Hippo pathway, promoted cell proliferation, migration, and collagen production in lung fibroblasts. Furthermore, the pro-fibrotic action of YAP1 was mediated by transcriptional activation of Twist1 through interacting with its partner TEAD. In contrast, knockdown of YAP1 inhibited extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, which ultimately ameliorated lung fibrosis in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, we constructed a dysregulated miRNA regulatory network that affects the expression of the Hippo pathway effectors in IPF and identified miR-15a, which is significantly down-regulated in IPF patients, as one of the most essential miRNAs regulating this pathway. Moreover, knockdown of miR-15a resulted in fibroblast activation and lung fibrosis through promoting Twist expression by targeting inhibition of YAP1. In contrast, therapeutic restoration of miR-15a inhibits fibrogenesis in lung fibroblast and abrogated BLM-induced lung fibrosis in mice. These results highlight a role for miR-15a/YAP1/Twist axis in IPF that offer novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of lung fibrosis.", "citation_paragraph": "Previous studies have shown that the complex of YAP1 and TEAD translocate into the nucleus, where they associate with transcription factors and other DNA-binding proteins to modulate target gene transcription [14] . Thus, we wanted to uncover the molecular mechanisms that mediate the profibrotic effects of YAP1 and to determine whether TEAD is involved in YAP1-driven lung fibrosis. To gain insight into the mechanism of YAP1, we utilized mutation of the YAP1 gene (YAP1-S94A, a loss-of-function mutant of YAP1) and the pharmacological inhibitor verteporfin, which specifically blocks the combination of YAP1 and TEAD. As demonstrated in Fig. 2a-c , overexpression of YAP1 enhanced the formation of Col 1\u03b11, Col 3\u03b11, and CTGF, whereas this effect was eliminated by applying verteporfin. On the other hand, interrupting the binding between YAP1 and TEAD1 by overexpressing YAP1-S94A prevented the YAP1-induced synthesis of Col 1\u03b11, Col 3\u03b11, and CTGF ( Fig. 2a-c) . Moreover, verteporfin attenuated the YAP1-induced up-regulation of fibrotic-associated proteins, and YAP1-S94A had no effect on these proteins (Fig. 2d) . These data suggest that YAP1 promotes fibrogenesis by interacting with TEAD.Then, we applied computational analysis to explore the molecules downstream of YAP1/TEAD that might be involved in the process of lung fibrosis and found that there is a putative TEAD1-binding site within the promoter region of the Twist gene (Fig. 2e) , indicating that YAP1/TEAD1 has the potential to regulate Twist expression at the transcriptional level. More importantly, forced expression of YAP1 increased the expression of Twist at both the protein and mRNA levels, whereas this effect was reversed by verteporfin, and YAP1-S94A prevented the up-regulation of Twist (Fig. 2f, g ). Next, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay to further explore the correlation between YAP1 and Twist. As depicted in Fig. 2h , i, the ChIP and qRT-PCR assays revealed minimal binding of TEAD1 or YAP1 with the Twist promoter, which was significantly increased after transfection with TEAD1 or YAP1. Next, to examine the effect of TEAD1 or YAP1 on the promoter activity of Twist, we constructed a Twist luciferase reporter with the TEAD1-binding site (Twist-Luc) or a mutant TEAD1-binding site (mTwist-Luc). Then, we transfected lung fibroblasts with and without TEAD1 or YAP1 overexpression with the Twist-Luc and mTwist-Luc reporters. We found that overexpression of TEAD1 or YAP1 increased the luciferase activity of Twist -Luc by combining with the complementary binding site, and this activity was eliminated when we used mTwist-Luc (Fig. 2j) .To further examine whether Twist is necessary for the pro-fibrotic effects of YAP1, we transfected shRNA against Twist into lung fibroblasts to inhibit the expression of Twist. As shown in Fig. 3a , b, we found that knockdown of Twist attenuated the effect of YAP1 on ; n = 6 cell batches. e, f Photomicrographs of double fluorescent staining with EDU (red) and DAPI (blue) demonstrate that YAP1 accelerated lung fibroblast proliferation; n = 5. The wound scratch assay (g, h) and immunofluorescence depicting fibroblast-myofibroblast transition (i) were used to identify the pro-fibrotic effect of YAP1; n = 5. j Fibrotic-associated protein expression was determined by western blot analysis. YAP1 increased the expression of collagen 1, Fn1, and \u03b1-SMA. The data are presented as the mean \u00b1 S.E.M.; n = 5; *P < 0.05 collagen production. Moreover, silencing Twist alleviated YAP1-induced proliferation ( Fig. 3c ) and inhibited YAP1 caused cell migration in lung fibroblasts (Fig. 3d) . Meanwhile, inhibition of Twist ablated the up-regulation of fibrosis-relevant proteins driven by YAP1 (Fig. 3e ). These data indicated that YAP1 contributes to the development of fibrogenesis in lung fibroblasts by forming the YAP1/TEAD complex and then transcriptionally activates the expression of Twist.Silencing YAP1 alleviated experimental pulmonary fibrosis in mice Next, we continued to confirm the comprehensive role of YAP1 in bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis. To determine whether suppression of YAP1 could mitigate pulmonary fibrosis in mice, adenovirus-associated virus 5 (AAV5) containing a sh-YAP1 fragment was established and was designated AAV5-sh-YAP1. At 3 days after administration of BLM, AAV5-sh-YAP1 was intrabronchially injected into mice. As shown in Fig. 4a , b, our data revealed that AAV5-sh-YAP1 ameliorated the BLMinduced interstitial lung fibrosis based on Masson's staining and HE staining. The immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining demonstrated low expression of collagen 1, Fn1, and YAP1 after treatment with AAV5-sh-YAP1 in the BLM-induced mice model (Fig. 4c ), along with a dramatic reduction in the production of Col 1\u03b11, Col 3\u03b11 and CTGF and the levels of Fn1, \u03b1-SMA, and Twist1 at the mRNA and protein levels ( Fig. 4d-g ). Moreover, the AAV-mediated delivery in the current study is not specific to fibroblasts, and we thus isolated the adult lung fibroblasts from wild-type mice 3 weeks after injection of AAV5-sh-YAP1, and found that the expression of YAP1 was significantly decreased in the mice lung fibroblasts after injection of AAV5-sh-YAP1 (Fig. 4h ). These data indicate that knockdown of YAP1 relieved the pulmonary injury induced by BLM, at least in part, by modulating lung fibroblasts. and mRNA levels; n = 5. h Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay revealed an association between YAP1/TEAD1 and Twist1 in lung fibroblasts; IgG served as a negative control; n = 3. i qRT-PCR analyses revealed that TEAD1/YAP1 was able to bind to the twist promoter region and promoted Twist1 expression in lung fibroblast;. n = 3. j Luciferase reporter constructs containing the empty vector pGL3 in the presence or absence of binding sites, as illustrated in (e), exhibited enhanced Twist1-Luc luciferase activity, whereas mutTwist1-luc had no effect on luciferase activity; n = 5.

In genome annotation, multiple methods are often run and agreement between methods taken as confirmation. In this paper, we assess the advantages of combining search methods by comparing seven pairwise alignment methods, including three local dynamic programming algorithms (PRSS, SSEARCH and SCANPS), two global dynamic programming algorithms (GSRCH and AMPS) and two heuristic approximations (BLAST and FASTA), individually and by pairwise intersection and union of their result lists at equal p-value cut-offs.   RESULTS When applied singly, the dynamic programming methods SCANPS and SSEARCH gave significantly better coverage (p=0.01) compared to AMPS, GSRCH, PRSS, BLAST and FASTA. Results ranked by BLAST p-values gave significantly better coverage compared to ranking by BLAST e-values. Of 56 combinations of eight methods considered, 19 gave significant increases in coverage at low error compared to the parent methods at an equal p-value cutoff. The union of results by BLAST (p-value) and FASTA at an equal p-value cutoff gave significantly better coverage than either method individually. The best overall performance was obtained from the intersection of the results from SSEARCH and the GSRCH62 global alignment method. At an error level of five false positives, this combination found 444 true positives, a significant 12.4% increase over SSEARCH applied alone.", "citation_paragraph": "The amount of publicly available DNA sequence data continues to double every 10 months (Stoesser et al., 2002) . Once probable open reading frames have been identified in a newly sequenced genome, the task is to assign a putative function to the coding regions on the basis of similarity to previously annotated proteins (e.g. Bork and Koonin, 1998) .Similarities may be found by pairwise sequence searches where a single sequence is scanned against each sequence in a database by dynamic programming or heuristic methods (for reviews, see Barton, 1996; Durbin et al., 1998) . More effective methods for identifying sequence similarity exploit multiple alignment profiles (Gribskov et al., 1987; Barton and Sternberg, 1990) or hidden markov models (Sonnhammer et al., 1997) , but these rely on pairwise searches as the first step in finding sequences from which the initial profile is constructed (Altschul et al., 1997; Sonnhammer et al., 1997; Rychlewski et al., 2000) .Although studies have been performed into the number of true homologues versus false identified by sequence searching methods (Pearson, 1991 (Pearson, , 1995 (Pearson, , 1998 Brenner et al., 1998) , less consideration has been given to whether such methods are identifying the same homologues at a given level of error. Evaluation is complicated since methods vary, not only in terms of the algorithm and its implementation (Barton, 1996; Durbin et al., 1998) , but also in the techniques applied to assess significance (Pagni and Jongeneel, 2001) . For example, while BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990 (Altschul et al., , 1997 employs preset parameters to estimate significance from Extreme Value (EV) distributions, FASTA (Pearson and Lipman, 1988) and SSEARCH (Pearson, 1991 (Pearson, , 1995 estimate these parameters from EV distributions fitted to scores for sequences thought to be unrelated to the query sequence in each database search.Differences in performance may also result from the use of alternative substitution matrices and gap penalties. The use of multiple substitution matrices for sequence searching has been investigated previously (Altschul, 1991; Henikoff and Henikoff, 1993) . Altschul (Altschul, 1991) suggested that employing multiple matrices may find more homologues over a wider evolutionary distance and supported this with evidence from four sequence searches. However, Henikoff and Henikoff (1993) tested Altschul's suggestion on a subset of PIR 9.0 (Barker et al., 2001 ) with BLAST 1.2.9 (Altschul et al., 1990) , and found no improvement over the best single matrix.Variations in any chosen search method may lead to different homologues detected at the same error or p-value. Exploiting these differences could result in increased sensitivity for sequence searching. This is of particular importance in genome annotation systems that employ multiple pairwise alignment methods to assign similarity (Andrade et al., 1999; Gaasterland and Sensen, 1996) .In this paper, the effect of combining multiple pairwise sequence search methods is evaluated.

The mechanism by which this occurs is not understood. Current theories propose that a key step requires the coalescence of a substrate-binding TatC-containing complex with a TatA complex, which forms pores of varying sizes that could accommodate different substrates. We have studied the structure of the TatAd complex from Bacillus subtilis using electron microscopy to generate the first 3D model of a TatA complex from a Gram-positive bacterium. We observe that TatAd does not exhibit the remarkable heterogeneity of Escherichia coli TatA complexes but instead forms ring-shaped complexes of 7.5-9nm diameter with potential pores of 2.5-3nm diameter that are occluded at one end. Such structures are consistent with those seen for E. coli TatE complexes. Furthermore, the small diameter of the TatAd pore, and the homogeneous nature of the complexes, suggest that TatAd cannot form the translocation channel by itself. Biochemical data indicate that another B. subtilis TatA complex, TatAc, has similar properties, suggesting a common theme for TatA-type complexes from Bacillus.", "citation_paragraph": "Samples of TatAd complexes were taken from under the major gel filtration peak (fraction 21 in Fig. 1B ) and analysed by single particle EM in negative stain. After screening for optimal imaging conditions, it was found that a 1:8 dilution with GF buffer (which contained 0.02% DDM) resulted in a relatively well-dispersed, homogeneous population which, whilst a few particles were clustered in pairs or small groups, enabled more than 2000 single particles of TatAd to be selected for analysis. (Fig. 2A) . This dilution was used for the subsequent imaging and single particle analysis. The TatAd particles adopted a preferred orientation on the grid. Therefore, a random conical tilt reconstruction strategy was used for single particle analysis [36] , which provides the range of alternative views required to compute a 3D model. Accordingly, micrographs were taken in pairs, both untilted ( Fig. 2A ) and tilted to 50\u00b0 (  Fig. 2B ). TatAd complexes appear as small, discrete and well-defined ring-shaped particles with a central pool of stain (Fig. 2C ) similar to those observed previously for TatA and TatE of E. coli. A total of 2540 initial particles were picked interactively from across 22 tilt pairs of micrographs. All particles were normalised and corrected for the effect of the contrast transfer function (CTF) by phase flipping. After discarding particles which were clipped or broken, 1990 untilted particles were iteratively centred using a reference-free method. This gave an initial rotationally averaged sum image of~7.5 nm diameter (Fig. 3A) . The particles were then assessed for size variation following the published method [34] . Using multivariate-statistical analysis (MSA), the dataset was separated into four potential size classes showing an overall variation of only~1.5 nm in diameter (Fig. 3B ). This initial size classification was validated using a multi-reference alignment and re-classification method (see Experimental procedures section). The smallest class measures only 7.5 nm in diameter (Class 1) and is the most abundant (547 images) and well defined. The largest class is 9 nm in diameter (Class 4) and is the least populated (352 images). Attempts were made to identify larger rings from within the discarded particles, but no significant population could be found. A variation in the intensity of central staining that correlates with the diameter of the particle was also observed. Clear central density is present in the Class 4 average whilst this is absent in Class 1. After reference-free alignment of the untilted particles (Fig. 3C) and centring of the corresponding tilted particles, initial 3D models were generated. These density maps were then iteratively refined by matching the original tilted particles to projections of the initial models to improve their cross-correlation. In Fig. 3D the class averages are compared to reprojections of their corresponding final density map. In Classes 1-3, the 3D density map appears as a small asymmetrical ring made up of 5 globular densities measuring~2.5 nm across, and in Class 4 there are 6 globular densities. No variation in ring thickness is present between the classes (Fig. 4A) . Only the largest class (Class 4) shows significant occlusion of the central channel. This is more prominent on the face away from the grid. Pore size also does not appear to vary between the classes (measuring 2.5-3 nm across). The 3 smaller classes have a ring height of~4 nm increasing to 5.5 nm for the larger class. The complexes are estimated to range from 70 kDa to 120 kDa based on the enclosed volume of the density maps at 3.8\u03c3. In order to aid interpretation, we manually placed the published solution state NMR structure of TatAd monomers [37] into the density map of the largest (Class 4) TatAd complexes to give an indication of the relative sizes of the two structures (Fig. 4B) . This comparison shows that the 3 nm long transmembrane helix (TMH) fits well into the ring density with the 4 nm long amphipathic helix (APH) forming a potential lid structure occluding the central cavity. Biochemical studies [38, 39] have indicated that TatA homologues adopt a minimal tetrameric oligomeric state but placing 4 TatAd monomers into our density by no means fills the available density. We illustrate this point with our largest size class as insertion of the TatAd structure into the smaller classes would require some bending of the monomer to achieve a fit. Previous structural studies on TatAd using circular dichroism and solid-state NMR have shown that the APH is oriented parallel to the lipid bilayer [40] [41] [42] , with the more recent solution state NMR study indicating a high level of flexibility in the APH C-terminal region [37] . This may explain the loss of lid structure density in the Class 2 and Class 3 density maps.The smallest class (Fig. 4A , Class 1) shows potential extensions arising from the globular ring densities. The clarity of the staining of these particles is somewhat affected in comparison with those in other classes, possibly due to the altered conformation. Alignment of these particles by projection matching showed that the 'arm' density was a significant feature of these particles and did not disappear during filtering. Manual analysis of the original tilted particles shows a range of small rings with these 'arm' extensions (Fig. 5A) . One or two extensions measuring 1-2 nm can be seen to protrude from the circumference of the ring (Fig. 5A and B) , and such extensions are not seen in the larger classes or in any of the untilted particles. The total length of these extended regions is~4 nm including the ring density. A possible candidate for forming these extensions could be the APH of the TatAd subunit, which could form a structure compatible with an aqueous channel. Such a conformational change has been suggested previously for E. coli TatA [43] and could be due to the flexibility of the hinge region [37] . The flexibility of the hinge region may permit alternative arrangements of the APH, explaining why the 'arm' structure is seen in only a subset of TatAd complexes. This conformational change could explain the slight variation in ring diameter across the TatAd complexes observed, with the TMH shifting from a tilted orientation to a straighter alignment, parallel to the APH. However, it is also conceivable that the 'arm' density is due to other structural rearrangements within the Class1 TatAd complexes, for example as proposed in the recent 'charge zipper mechanism' for TatA function [44] .3.3. B. subtilis TatAc forms small, homogeneous complexes and can restore export of TorA in a \u0394tatAE mutant Our data on TatAd complexes represent the first structural information on the Tat complexes from a Gram-positive organism. The data show that the TatAd complexes are relatively small and structurally homogeneous, and this raises the question as to whether this is a general feature of such complexes. We have made a first step towards addressing this question by analysing another TatA-type complex from B. subtilis: the TatAc complex. We first expressed TatAc with a C-terminal Strep-II \u2122 tag in E. coli \u0394tatAE and \u0394tatB cells. These were fractionated and the whole membranes were solubilised in 2% digitonin. The solubilised proteins were then analysed by blue native (BN) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to identify membrane protein complexes. The native gels were then subjected to immunoblotting with antibodies against the Strep-II\u2122 tag. As shown in Fig. 6A , TatAc forms a small and homogeneous complex of~100 kDa, similar to the complex observed for E. coli TatE [12] , in the absence of other TatA-type complexes or TatB components. We also expressed TatAc in E. coli \u0394tat cells and observed the same TatAc complex. This shows that the stability of the TatAc complex is neither affected by native expression levels of other E. coli Tat components, nor their absence. As with TatAd, the properties of this homogeneous TatAc complex contrast with the widely varying sizes of E. coli TatA bands observed with BN gels. Further to this, we tested whether TatAc can functionally replace TatA and TatE and restore translocation activity in E. coli \u0394tatAE cells. The TMAO reductase activity assay was performed as described previously [12] . As shown in Fig. 6B , the expression of TatAc is sufficient to restore translocation activity in the presence of native levels of E. coli TatB and TatC, with no activity detectable in the periplasmic fraction in the absence of a TatA-like component (\u0394tatAE control). The periplasmic signal with TatAc complementation (\u0394tatAE + TatAc cells) is lower than in wild type cells, raising the possibility that translocation is less efficient. Nonetheless, the ability of TatAc to substitute for TatA/E provides strong evidence that the homogeneous TatAc complexes are physiologically relevant (Table 1 ).", "citance": "However, it is also conceivable that the 'arm' density is due to other structural rearrangements within the Class1 TatAd complexes, for example as proposed in the recent 'charge zipper mechanism' for TatA function [44] .3.3.", "claims": [{"text": "The arm density of TatAd complexes is due to structural rearrangements within Class1 TatAd complexes such as the 'charge zipper mechanism'.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 46855126, "title": "Structural basis of sterol recognition and nonvesicular transport by lipid transfer proteins anchored at membrane contact sites.", "abstract": "Membrane contact sites (MCSs) in eukaryotic cells are hotspots for lipid exchange, which is essential for many biological functions, including regulation of membrane properties and protein trafficking. Lipid transfer proteins anchored at membrane contact sites (LAMs) contain sterol-specific lipid transfer domains [StARkin domain (SD)] and multiple targeting modules to specific membrane organelles. Elucidating the structural mechanisms of targeting and ligand recognition by LAMs is important for understanding the interorganelle communication and exchange at MCSs. Here, we determined the crystal structures of the yeast Lam6 pleckstrin homology (PH)-like domain and the SDs of Lam2 and Lam4 in the apo form and in complex with ergosterol. The Lam6 PH-like domain displays a unique PH domain fold with a conserved N-terminal \u03b1-helix. The Lam6 PH-like domain lacks the basic surface for phosphoinositide binding, but contains hydrophobic patches on its surface, which are critical for targeting to endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondrial contacts. Structures of the LAM SDs display a helix-grip fold with a hydrophobic cavity and a flexible \u03a91-loop as a lid. Ergosterol is bound to the pocket in a head-down orientation, with its hydrophobic acyl group located in the tunnel entrance. The \u03a91-loop in an open conformation is essential for ergosterol binding by direct hydrophobic interaction. Structural comparison suggested that the sterol binding mode of the Lam2 SD2 is likely conserved among the sterol transfer proteins of the StARkin superfamily. Structural models of full-length Lam2 correlated with the sterol transport function at the membrane contact sites.", "citation_paragraph": "Overall Structure of the LAM StARkin Domains. The six LAM homologs in yeast all contain a PH-like domain in their N-terminal region, one or two StARkin lipid transfer domains, and a transmembrane helix at the C-terminal region (Fig. 1A) . The SDs are composed of 160-190 amino acids. LAMs often contain a short, charged sequence of fewer than 20 amino acids at the C-terminal end of their second SD (Fig. S1 ). To determine the structures of key domains of LAMs, we performed X-ray crystallographic studies of BAR domains, PH-like domains, and SDs from LAM homologs. We determined crystal structures of both the first and second SDs (hereafter referred to as SD1 and SD2, respectively) of Lam2 and Lam4 in apo forms at 1.5-1.9-\u00c5 resolutions (Table  S1 ). The structure of the ergosterol-bound Lam2 SD2 was determined at 2.6-\u00c5 resolution (Fig. 1B) . We solved the structure of the Lam4 SD1 by single anomalous dispersion using Se-methioninelabeled crystals. The structures of the other SDs were solved by molecular replacement, using the structure of the Lam4 SD1.The SDs of Lam2 and Lam4 contain three \u03b1-helices and a sixstranded antiparallel \u03b2-sheet, which fold into a half-barrel structure (Fig. 1C) . The \u03b2-sheet wraps around the longest helix, \u03b13, forming a helix-grip fold, which is commonly observed in StART and Bet_v1 family proteins. The \u03b2-sheet of the SD consists of six, rather than seven, \u03b2-strands. The residues connecting \u03b26 and \u03b12 form an extended loop, which is typically a \u03b2-strand in the related StART domains (17) . The helix grip fold formed by the twisted \u03b2-sheet creates a large tunnel in the core of the protein. The C-terminal side of tunnel is plugged by \u03b12 and \u03b13 helices, and the other end is flanked by the \u03b22-\u03b23 and \u03b24-\u03b25 loops. The SD1 and SD2 from Lam2 and Lam4 display amino acid sequence identities of 34-56% between them (Fig. S1 ). The overall structures of four SDs from Lam2 and Lam4 are highly conserved. All LAM SDs are superimposable within a C \u03b1 rmsd of 0.7 \u00c5 (Fig. 1D) .The \u03b22-\u03b23 loop, which is referred to as the \u03a91-loop, is the most flexible part of the SDs, displaying the highest B-factors in their structures. The \u03a91-loops of all SDs of Lam2 and Lam4 reported in this study were in open conformation or disordered. The \u03a91-loops of the Lam2 SD1 and Lam2 SD2 in apo forms were disordered in the crystal and were not visible. The \u03a91-loops of the Lam4 SD1 and Lam4 SD2 were weakly visible owing to stabilization by lattice contact interactions in the crystals. The flexible \u03a91-loop was suggested to serve as a gate to the ligand-binding cavity in StART domains (18, 19) . A transient opening of the \u03a91-loop was known to be sufficient for sterol uptake and release, as determined by molecular dynamics simulations (18) .The SDs of Lam2 and Lam4 are monomers in solution when analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography during protein purification. In the asymmetric unit of the apo Lam2 SD2, two molecules were found to form a domain-swapped dimer. The two Lam2 SD2 molecules exchanged the identical C-terminal helix (residues 1,191-1,223) between each other. However, size-exclusion chromatography analysis showed that the apparent oligomeric state of the Lam2 SD2 was a monomer before crystallization. The domainswapped conformation likely originated from the flexible nature of SDs and seems to be a crystallographic artifact.

The primary outcome was the composite incidence of acute coronary syndrome, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, or noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. The primary analysis was by intention-to-treat.   RESULTS The primary outcome occurred in 15 of 282 patients (5.3%) who received colchicine and 40 of 250 patients (16.0%) assigned no colchicine (hazard ratio: 0.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.18 to 0.59; p < 0.001; number needed to treat: 11). In a pre-specified secondary on-treatment analysis that excluded 32 patients (11%) assigned to colchicine who withdrew within 30 days due to intestinal intolerance and a further 7 patients (2%) who did not start treatment, the primary outcome occurred in 4.5% versus 16.0% (hazard ratio: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.15 to 0.56; p < 0.001).   CONCLUSIONS Colchicine 0.5 mg/day administered in addition to statins and other standard secondary prevention therapies appeared effective for the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with stable coronary disease.", "citation_paragraph": "The LoDoCo trial demonstrated that the addition of colchicine 0.5 mg/day to standard therapy in patients with stable coronary disease significantly reduced the risk of a cardiovascular event, including ACS, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. The benefits of colchicine were achieved on a background of widespread use of effective secondary prevention strategies, including high-dose statins, as evidenced by the low event rate in the control group (11) . The effect of adding colchicine became evident early, continued to accrue over time, and was largely driven by a reduction in ACS unrelated to stent disease.These results are important because they suggest that colchicine, in contrast to its apparent lack of effect in the prevention of stent-related disease (7), may have a role in the prevention of cardiovascular events caused by instability of native atherosclerotic plaques in patients with stable coronary disease, possibly by inhibiting an inflammatory pathway that has been indentified in unstable native coronary plaques (3) .The presence of activated neutrophils in the plaques of patients with unstable coronary syndromes (3) suggested that they may play a key role in the transformation of a stable, to an unstable plaque. Although the mechanism of benefit of colchicine was not the subject of this study, the drug is known to have protean effects that may be responsible for the improved clinical outcome of patients observed in this study, the best documented of which is the inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis, ingress, and activation within a proinflammatory environment (12) such as may exist in an unstable plaque.Indirect support for a beneficial effect of colchicine on cardiovascular disease comes from retrospective observations that continuous use of colchicine was associated with a lower than expected risk of AMI in patients with FMF (13) and gout (14) , and the demonstration that low-dose colchicine can reduce levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein in patients with stable coronary disease (15) .Although most physicians are familiar with the shortterm use of colchicine from its widespread use in gout and pericarditis (16) , few will have prescribed it continuously to their patients. However, the long-term use of colchicine, at doses of 1 to 2 mg/day, has been well documented to be safe and reasonably well tolerated in patients with FMF (17). Values are n (%). *Nonfatal.

Mitotic functions of LIS1 have been suggested from many organisms throughout evolution. However, the cellular functions of LIS1 at distinct intracellular compartments such as the centrosome and the cell cortex have not been well defined especially during mitotic cell division. Here, we used detailed cellular approaches and time-lapse live cell imaging of mitosis from Lis1 mutant mouse embryonic fibroblasts to reveal critical roles of LIS1 in mitotic spindle regulation. We found that LIS1 is required for the tight control of chromosome congression and segregation to dictate kinetochore-microtubule (MT) interactions and anaphase progression. In addition, LIS1 is essential for the establishment of mitotic spindle pole integrity by maintaining normal centrosome number. Moreover, LIS1 plays crucial roles in mitotic spindle orientation by increasing the density of astral MT plus-end movements toward the cell cortex, which enhances cortical targeting of LIS1-dynein complex. Overexpression of NDEL1-dynein and MT stabilization rescues spindle orientation defects in Lis1 mutants, demonstrating that mouse LIS1 acts via the LIS1-NDEL1-dynein complex to regulate astral MT plus-ends dynamics and establish proper contacts of MTs with the cell cortex to ensure precise cell division.", "citation_paragraph": "Mitotic cell divisions are essential for the accurate partitioning of genetic material into two daughter cells. Inappropriate segregation of chromosomes during mitosis leads to aneuploidy and genomic instability (1) . During the mitotic phase of the cell cycle (M phase), microtubules (MTs) undergo dynamic reorganization to coordinate chromosome separation. Mitotic spindles are assembled by dramatic MT remodeling and emanate from the centrosome, an MT-organizing center, also called the spindle pole (2) . The centrosome participates in MT nucleation and anchoring MT minus-ends. The core component of the centrosome is a centriole pair composed of a mother centriole and a daughter centriole, which recruits pericentriolar material components (3, 4) . The centrosome duplication cycle is precisely controlled to preserve centrosome number and proper centriole assembly (5) . Importantly, mammalian cell division planes are mainly determined by the positioning of bipolar mitotic spindles (6) . In addition, the spatiotemporal interactions between the cell cortex and astral MT plus-ends have critical roles in mitotic spindle regulation (7 -9) . Several MT plus-end binding proteins mediate dynamic contacts of astral MT plus-ends to the cell cortex by interacting with cortical force generators on the membrane (10) .Many of the proteins important for mitosis have been discovered, although much of the detailed mechanisms employed by each protein involved in cell division remains to be understood. Among those mitotically important proteins, LIS1 is part of a complex that interacts with diverse cortical factors and centrosomal proteins at kinetochores on the chromosomes, the mitotic spindles and the cell cortex, and it has been implicated in the regulation of the mitotic spindles and chromosome segregation during mitosis (11) (12) (13) . Human LIS1 was first identified as a causative gene of human lissencephaly ('smooth brain'), a severe neuro-developmental disease (14, 15) . Heterozygous mutation or deletion of human LIS1 leads to this brain malformation due to defects in neuronal migration. LIS1 is also part of a highly conserved protein complex first discovered in Aspergillus nidulans that is responsible for nuclear distribution (NUD) and functions in cytoplasmic dynein regulation (16, 17) . LIS1 homologues from Aspergillus to mammals form a complex with cytoplasmic dynein and NUD proteins (18 -20) . Cytoplasmic dynein is a MT minus-end-directed motor involved in mitotic spindle assembly by regulating MT dynamics especially at astral MTs and mediating poleward transport of spindle assembly checkpoint proteins (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) . Through its motor activity, cytoplasmic dynein exerts pulling forces on the chromosomes. Dynactin, an accessory linker protein complexed with dynein subunits, also contributes to these cellular functions by assisting cargo loading and increasing processivity (26) . Cortically anchored cytoplasmic dynein/dynactin complexes are important cortical force generators along MTs (24, 27) that are essential for mitotic spindle formation and positioning in M phase (21, 28) , and LIS1 has been implicated in dynein targeting at MT plus-ends along astral MTs during cell division of various cell types (11, 20, 29) . In addition, several NUD family proteins associate with both LIS1 and cytoplasmic dynein. Two mammalian NudE homologues, NDE1 and NDEL1, interact with LIS1/cytoplasmic dynein complex (19, (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) . NDE1 and NDEL1 display prominent centrosomal localization, as does LIS1 (19, 32, 35) . NDE1 is required for targeting of LIS1 to the cytoplasmic dynein complex to generate persistent motor forces (36, 37) , while NDEL1 has been implicated in the process of LIS1/ dynein recruitment, serving as a scaffold (11, 38, 39) . In addition, a subset of NDE1 and NDEL1 proteins is observed in close proximity to the cell cortex where LIS1 accumulates (13, 40, 41) . These previous studies support the notion that the LIS1 -NDE1/NDEL1 -dynein/dynactin complex is likely part of the protein machinery needed to coordinate various signals from the cell cortex to the mitotic spindles by generating pulling forces on spindle MTs. Despite these studies, the precise functions of LIS1 and its complex during mitosis remain elusive. Furthermore, it is unclear whether other components of LIS1 protein complex are involved in LIS1-dependent mitotic spindle regulation during mammalian cell division.We took advantage of genetic null (knock-out, KO) and hypomorphic-conditional (HC) alleles of Lis1 (42, 43) to uncover the critical dose-dependent roles of LIS1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and mouse neural progenitors (NPs). Previously, we found that Lis1 deficiency in mouse brains resulted in apoptosis and mitotic spindle orientation defects in NPs, while in MEFs loss of Lis1 led to severe defects in cell growth and MT capture at the cell cortex in interphase cells (13) . In the current study, we used Lis1 mutant MEFs and performed time-lapse live cell imaging of mitotic progression compared with WT MEFs, to examine the functions of LIS1 during mitosis. We also analyzed mitotic spindle organization in detail by examining centrosome integrity and number. To address the mechanism of LIS1-dependent spindle regulation, we overexpressed several candidate protein complexed with LIS1 in Lis1 mutant MEFs and tested whether any of them can rescue spindle misorientation defects caused by Lis1-deficiency. Importantly, we performed time-lapse live cell imaging of MT plus-ends in Lis1 mutant MEFs to explore changes in the dynamics of astral MTs reaching to the cell cortex. Thus, by using both genetic and conditional Lis1 mutant MEFs with reduced LIS1 protein amount, we investigated essential functions of LIS1 complex to form proper mitotic spindle during mammalian cell division.", "citance": "The centrosome duplication cycle is precisely controlled to preserve centrosome number and proper centriole assembly (5) .", "claims": [{"text": "The centrosome duplication cycle is precisely controlled to preserve centrosome number and proper centriole assembly.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Here, we visualized a combination of histone modifications by applying the in situ proximity ligation assay, which detects two proteins in close vicinity (\u223c30 nm). The specificity of the method [designated as imaging of a combination of histone modifications (iChmo)] was confirmed by positive signals from H3K4me3/acetylated H3K9, H3K4me3/RNA polymerase II and H3K9me3/H4K20me3, and negative signals from H3K4me3/H3K9me3. Bivalent modification was clearly visualized by iChmo in wild-type embryonic stem cells (ESCs) known to have it, whereas rarely in Suz12 knockout ESCs and mouse embryonic fibroblasts known to have little of it. iChmo was applied to analysis of epigenetic and phenotypic changes of heterogeneous cell population, namely, ESCs at an early stage of differentiation, and this revealed that the bivalent modification disappeared in a highly concerted manner, whereas phenotypic differentiation proceeded with large variations among cells. Also, using this method, we were able to visualize a combination of repressive histone marks in tissue samples. The application of iChmo to samples with heterogeneous cell population and tissue samples is expected to clarify unknown biological and pathological significance of various combinations of epigenetic modifications.", "citation_paragraph": "An imaging method for a combination of epigenetic modifications in close proximity was established and was designated as iChmo. It had the capacity to visualize the combinations at the single cell level and thus was able to analyze heterogeneous samples, such as a cell line consisting of cells at various differentiation stages and tissue samples. The application of iChmo to ESCs at their differentiation revealed that the epigenetic layer of differentiation takes place in a highly concerted manner before the phenotypic layer of differentiation. Previous reports showed that gene expression changes at several genes occur in parallel with histone modification changes during ESC differentiation (21, 22) . In addition, it is reported that, at Hoxa1 and Sox21, development-related genes marked with bivalent modification, H3K27me3 levels decreased before gene activation at the early stage of ESC differentiation (23, 24) (D) The number of fluorescence spots was counted in ESCs before (n = 33), and 24 (n = 37) and 48 (n = 38) h after the RA treatment (MannWhitney U-test; *P < 0.001). Although the decrease of Oct-4 expression and increase of \u00dfIII-tubulin were highly variable among the ESCs treated with RA, the decrease of the bivalent modification was highly coordinated.applicability to a heterogeneous cell population and the role of bivalent modification in 'stemness', iChmo might be able to evaluate the level of cell reprogramming and the quality of iPS cells (25) . iChmo is also used for analysis of tissue sections. Although we analyzed only a limited number of combinations of histone modifications for now owing to availability of specific antibodies, analysis of tissue samples is expected to produce rich information, such as localization of tissue stem cells. Indeed, Lien et al. (4) clearly showed that the combination of H3K4me3 and H3K79me2 was specifically found in quiescent hair follicle stem cells by ChIP-sequencing. We can expect that, by using iChmo, the presence of such combination of histone modifications can be demonstrated in a small amount of cells of histological sections. Also, aberrant expression of histone modifiers is now becoming evident in human disorders, especially in cancers (26) , and iChmo might clarify which aberrant combinations are present, even if the fraction of cells with such aberrant combinations is small.Analysis of human colonic tissue samples revealed the presence of heterogeneity of iChmo spots of H3K9me3 and H4K20me3, and the cells without iChmo spots coincided with those with strong DAPI intensity (Supplementary Figure S4) . It is known that DAPI intensity is affected by DNA content, reflecting the phase of the cell cycle. In addition, considering that the levels of H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 dynamically change during the cell cycle (27), we can speculate that the heterogeneity of iChmo spots of H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 reflects the difference of the phases of the cell cycle.The maximum distance between the primary antibodies recognized by two PLA probes has been estimated to be $30 nm (14) , which is longer than the minimum distance between two nucleosomes ($15 nm). Thus, there remains a possibility that combinations of histone modifications visualized in this study originated from two neighboring nucleosomes. However, the fact that few fluorescence spots were produced for the combination of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in MEFs supported that the signals are produced from two modifications at a close distance, theoretically within two neighboring nucleosomes.iChmo showed a large number of spots of bivalent modification in ESCs, but only a small number of spots in MEFs, which was in line with a report by Bernstein et al. (3) . At the same time, Mikkelsen et al. (5) reported that a half of bivalent marks in mouse ESCs still remained in MEFs. The apparent discrepancy between the iChmo data and the previous report can be accounted for by two possibilities; (i) because one iChmo spot does not always reflect one combination of histone modifications owing to the principle of in situ PLA (14) , and all regions with coexistence of histone modifications are not visualized by this method, and (ii) because the number of bivalent marks is different according to the culture period of MEFs. In this study, we used MEFs cultured at passage five, whereas Mikkelsen et al. (5) used primary MEFs, and the authors also suggested the latter possibility.To summarize, a specific combination of histone modifications was visualized by applying the in situ PLA, and the method was capable of analyzing heterogeneous cell population and tissue samples. Application of the method has the potential to uncover previously unknown biological and pathological significances of combinations of histone modifications.", "citance": "Indeed, Lien et al.

{"s2orc_id": 13959514, "title": "Stem cell mechanobiology: diverse lessons from bone marrow.", "abstract": "A stem cell niche is defined by various chemical and physical features that influence whether a stem cell remains quiescent, divides, or differentiates. We review mechanical determinants that affect cell fate through actomyosin forces, nucleoskeleton remodeling, and mechanosensitive translocation of transcription factors. Current methods for physical characterization of tissue microenvironments are summarized together with efforts to recapitulate niche mechanics in culture. We focus on mesenchymal stem cells, particularly in osteogenesis and adipogenesis, and on blood stem cells - both of which reside in mechanically diverse marrow microenvironments. Given the explosion of efforts with pluripotent stem cells, the evident mechanosensitivity of clinically relevant, multipotent marrow cells underscores an increasing need to examine and understand in vivo and in vitro physical properties on length scales that cells sense.", "citation_paragraph": "Beyond MSCs, hematopoietic differentiation to various lineages is also regulated by mechanical stresses. For example, platelets are generated from megakaryocytes (MKs) that undergo maturation by accumulating DNA content without division. This process, termed polyploidization or endomitosis, occurs because weak adhesion to external interfaces limits cytokinesis. Interestingly, studies with non-mammalian cells have shown that adhesion to matrix provides traction forces to pull cells apart [41] . Consistent with this notion, MK polyploidization is inhibited on stiff matrix where stronger adhesion increases traction forces to drive cell division [42] . By contrast, soft matrix (typical of soft marrow [19] ) inhibits myosin-II forces and maximizes MK maturation. High-ploidy MKs have motile projections that migrate into the nearby bloodstream where shear causes fragmentation to pro-platelets [43] that then shearactivate myosin-II to promote its division into small, familiar platelets (except when myosin-IIA is mutated) [44] .Very early hematopoietic differentiation is also regulated by ECM mechanics in combination with other physical factors. The HSC:progenitor (P) ratio is maintained or increased on highly-flexible tropoelastin substrate compared to stiff crosslinked tropoelastin [45] . As with MSCs, inhibition of myosin II eliminates mechanosensing of HSCs and progenitors. Using mass spectrometry-calibrated intracellular flow cytometry, the composition of myosin-II isoforms was observed to switch from the polarizable B isoform to the more homogeneous A isoform during hematopoietic differentiation [19] . External stresses such as fluid shear and stiff matrix induced polarization of myosin-IIB, resulting in the switching of lamin isoforms. By contrast, soft matrix prevented myosin-IIB polarization. When polarization occurred during cell division, myosin-IIB was asymmetrically segregated to a daughter cell that maintained its stemness, while the cell with low myosin-IIB differentiated ( Figure 2B ). When myosin-IIB was downregulated in differentiated cells, myosin-IIA was activated by dephosphorylation, inducing actin polymerization. Soft matrix also maximized myosin-IIA phosphorylation. Together, these findings suggest that soft matrix (away from rigid bone) likely suppresses myosin-II isoform switching, while stiff matrix (near bone) drives asymmetric division ( Figure 2B) .By understanding the matrix constraints that regulate cell differentiation, one can begin to rationalize how cells are organized within a tissue. In bone marrow, cells exist in an environment with a gradient in stiffness over lengthscales several times greater than cellular dimensions. Osteoblasts localize to the osteoid interface, which is relatively stiff but is adjacent to cells such as pre-osteoblasts that are surrounded by softer matrix. MSCs reside in the interior of the bone marrow, but it is not clear how they reposition during commitment to lineages such as adipocytes or pre-osteoblasts. MSCs not only polarize toward and migrate into regions of greater stiffness [46] but also tend to differentiate according to ECM elasticity cues [47, 48] . It is notable that this 'durotaxis' process depends on myosin-II, and is evident in 3D matrix systems. Nonmuscle myosin II-B (NMII-B) is unpolarized on soft substrates but polarizes in the rear of the cell when the cell migrates from a soft to a stiff substrate. Moreover, stiffer substrates promote the assembly of NMII-A into stress fibers, which are necessary for NMII-B polarization [46] .Lamins: regulating cell fate with nuclear structure Within a cell, the nucleus is caged by the cytoskeleton such that stresses in the cytoskeleton propagate to the nuclear envelope (Figure 3 ) [49] and possibly influence the global organization of chromatin [50] . Key to maintaining the structure and physical properties of the nucleus is the nuclear lamina, a network of intermediate filament proteins of A-type lamins (lamins A and C are products of alternative splicing of the LMNA gene) and B-type lamins (lamins B1 and B2 are encoded by LMNB1 and LMNB2 genes, respectively). Lamins are located at the interface between the inner nuclear membrane and chromatin [51] [52] [53] [54] . The 'linker of nucleo-and cytoskeleton' (LINC) complex is a protein complex that might contribute to mechanical transduction of signals to the nucleus [55, 56] . Specifically, nesprins -a family of nuclear membrane proteins -connect to actin filaments in the cytoplasm through their N-terminal domains, while their C-terminal domains are anchored to SUN (from Sad1p, UNC-84) domain proteins, providing a direct physical link between the cytoskeleton and nucleoskeleton by spanning the inner nuclear membrane and in turn binding to the lamina.Tissue analyses have shown that lamin-A,C levels scale with the stiffness of a tissue, with stiffer tissues such as bone having higher levels of lamin-A,C than do softer tissues such as fat (Figure 2A ) [52] . While the expression of lamin-A,C increased 30-fold across tissues, the constitutively expressed B-type lamins varied by less than threefold. Although 'the truth is in the tissues', culture studies are likely to hint at possible mechanisms. For at least several types of cells in culture, lamin-A,C levels were also affected by cellular tension in a process regulated by mechanosensitive phosphorylation (Figure 3B,E) [57] . Studies of MSCs cultured on plastic had shown that lamin-A,C knockdown favors adipogenesis [58] whereas lamin-A,C overexpression favors osteogenesis [59] . By using PA gels with stiffness tuned to mimic either soft fat tissue or stiff osteoid, lamin-A,C was further shown to be a mechanosensitive enhancer of matrix elasticity-directed lineage specification in vitro (Figure 2A ) [52] .As with myosin-II isoform switching in hematopoiesis, the composition of the nuclear lamina not only changes with differentiation to blood lineages but knockdown and overexpression also demonstrate a functional influence [53] . Although the direct roles of matrix mechanics in nuclear lamin turnover of hematopoietic cells remain unstudied, a stiffer lamina impedes migration and -in principle -exit from the marrow. Furthermore, lamin-A,C changes less than B-type lamins across different hematopoietic lineages [53] . Because marrow matrix might be too soft to impact on lamin-A,C, relatively unique marrow factors likely regulate B-type lamins in this essential compartment, which generates millions of new blood cells per second in humans. The interplay between matrix, cytoskeletal, and nuclear mechanics during hematopoietic lineage specification certainly requires further investigation, but studies thus far with hematopoietic lineages provide initial insight into how adhesion, matrix elasticity, and external shear forces can couple to cytoskeletal and nuclear mechanics in processes central to stem cell selfrenewal, fate decisions, and even migration.", "citance": "Using mass spectrometry-calibrated intracellular flow cytometry, the composition of myosin-II isoforms was observed to switch from the polarizable B isoform to the more homogeneous A isoform during hematopoietic differentiation [19] .", "claims": [{"text": "The composition of myosin-II isoform switches from the A isoform to the B isoform during hematopoietic differentiation.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "The composition of myosin-II isoform switches from the polarizable B isoform to the more homogenous A isoform during hematopoietic differentiation.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

This is threatened by inflammation, which alters the local tissue over short and long time-scales. Uveitis due to autoimmune disease, especially when it involves the retina, leads to persistent changes in how the eye interacts with the immune system. The normal pattern of immune surveillance, which for immune privileged tissues is limited, is re-programmed. Many cell types, that are not usually present in the eye, become detectable. There are changes in the tissue homeostasis and integrity. In both human disease and mouse models, in the most extreme cases, immunopathological findings consistent with development of ectopic lymphoid-like structures and disrupted angiogenesis accompany severely impaired eye function. Understanding how the ocular environment is shaped by persistent inflammation is crucial to developing novel approaches to treatment.", "citation_paragraph": "One explanation for the reorganisation of immune cells in immune privileged tissues is that this allows a local response tailored to stimuli within the tissue. It raises questions about what these signals are and how autonomous they might be. Regulation of immune cell retention in tissues depends on the integration of signals from cell surface receptors that interact with soluble and cell surface ligands. These signals modulate many different aspects of cell function including activation state, location, motility, metabolism and differentiation. But are the molecular cues that regulate these processes local or systemic in nature? Should we envision immune reorganisation as arising in response to global instruction, or is a better model a series of loosely co-ordinated independent expressions of antigen specific immunity?The shortest distance over which effector functions act is between one cell and its neighbour. The exquisite specificity that can be achieved has been nicely demonstrated for CD8 + T cell killing, where within a skin graft composed of a mixture of MHC haplotypes, only those cells that elicit an allogeneic immune response are killed while non-allogenic neighbours survive (Rosenberg and Singer, 1988) . These cell-cell contact dependent events rely on the focused release of cytotoxic molecules. Studies directed at determining the maximum distance over which cytokines elicit effector functions have demonstrated that they can work over quite different scales. Some investigators have highlighted the importance of directional secretion of cytokines into the synaptic cleft (Huse et al., 2006; Sabatos et al., 2008) , while others have provided evidence that cytokines determine cell fate throughout a whole lymph node (Olekhnovitch et al., 2014; Perona-Wright et al., 2010) .Soluble effector molecules can co-ordinate acute tissue responses in other ways. The range over which signalling by interferon-gamma (IFN\u03b3) to macrophages establishes a killing zone is more than 80 \u03bcm from the activated T cells (M\u00fcller et al., 2012) . Then the high levels of nitric oxide (NO), produced in response to IFN\u03b3 signalling stimulated by intracellular Leishmania infection, entrains the elimination of parasites whether or not the individual macrophages have the capacity themselves to produce NO. This was shown by studying mixtures of cells competent or not competent for NO production: As enough NO becomes available throughout the tissue the individual phenotype of the macrophage is irrelevant to pathogen destruction (Olekhnovitch et al., 2014) . NO is also seen to be acting at a distance in EAU, and as well as activating macrophage/microglia, it is one of a number of effector molecules that limit the local proliferation of T cells (Raveney et al., , 2010 . How soluble molecules have action at a distance, called 'scaling effects', have been studied in other areas of cell biology. In development, 'source-sink' models have been explored since the 1970s to explain the generation of morphogen gradients (Rogers and Schier, 2011) . A recent report applying these concepts to cytokines such as IL-2 illuminate the application of this principle in the immune system, focusing on the balance between diffusion and consumption. In these experiments, the density of cytokine receptor bearing cells, which can remove cytokines from the environment, determines the distance over which the cytokines act (Oyler-Yaniv et al., 2017) . This work highlights how dynamic microenvironments can be, with their size changing in relation to the amount of cytokine and the density of cytokine consuming cells. This volume can be modelled as a sphere with a radius that varied from 30 to 150 \u03bcm. Interestingly, this would produce a local microenvironment on a similar scale to those found in follicles measured in human tonsils (Crocker et al., 1983; Gorfien et al., 1999) . But smaller niches have also been described, for example, stem cell niches in Drosophila which have recently been reported to have a radius of 25 \u03bcm (Liang et al., 2017) .", "citance": "In these experiments, the density of cytokine receptor bearing cells, which can remove cytokines from the environment, determines the distance over which the cytokines act (Oyler-Yaniv et al., 2017) .", "claims": [{"text": "The density of cytokine receptor bearing cells affects the distance over which cytokines act.", "subject": "The density of cytokine receptor bearing cells", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "The density of cytokine receptor bearing cells has no effect on the distance over which cytokines act.", "subject": "The density of cytokine receptor bearing cells", "is_negation": true}]}

It is expressed in na\u00efve T-cells and monocytes, however its level of expression decreases during activation and differentiation. KLF2 also plays critical regulatory role in various inflammatory diseases and their pathogenesis. Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB) is an important inducer of inflammation and the inflammation is mediated through the transcription of several proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules. So, both transcriptional factors KLF2 and NF-\u03baB are being associated with the similar cellular functions and their maintenance. It was shown that KLF2 regulates most of the NF-\u03baB-mediated activities. In this review, we focused on emphasizing the involvement of KLF2 in health and disease states and how they interact with transcriptional master regulator NF-\u03baB.", "citation_paragraph": "Monocytes are important component of innate immune system and are involved in cellular defense mechanism. Under normal physiological conditions they remain in an inactive state or quiescence condition. Upon injury or after induction with proinflammatory stimuli such as cytokines/chemokines, they differentiate into macrophages and regulate tissue injury and repair process. KLF2 has been identified as a novel regulator of proinflammatory factors in monocytes [6] . KLF2 expression in monocytes has been first shown and functionally studied by our group. Primary human monocytes show robust expression of KLF2 compared to the human monocytic cell line, which shows reduced expression. KLF2 expression in monocytes is also reduced with activation, differentiation into macrophages and osteoclastogenesis in pathological conditions [6, 8, 41] . The induced overexpression of KLF2 attenuated LPS-mediated activation of monocytes and reduced biological function, such as phagocytosis [6] . Interestingly, its forced expression sufficiently reduced the inflammatory effects both in in vitro and in vivo models [6] . Thus, KLF2 has been identified as an important modulator of proinflammatory signals. In murine model, KLF2 overexpression does not inhibit but rather augments monocytic recruitment to an inflammatory site, however, it inhibits the expression of cytokines and chemokines [6] . Thus, the anti-inflammatory effect of KLF2 is likely due to inhibition of proinflammatory gene expression in monocyte and not recruitment. Similar to T-cells, in monocytes, the KLF2 expression reduces with activation and differentiation into macrophages [6] . Thus, reduction in KLF2 expression is similar to that associated with T cells after activation [5] . It has been found that in monocytic cells, the anti-inflammatory effects of KLF2 are mediated through NF-\u03baB, AP1 and several coactivator molecules [6] . The KLF2-mediated mechanistic regulation of anti-inflammatory effects in monocytes has been of continuous research interest in inflammatory diseases.Monocyte activation is prerequisite for normal immune response, however this process must be tightly controlled to prevent host tissue damage and autoimmune disease. The deregulated and prolonged activation of monocytes has deleterious effects in several inflammatory diseases and chronic infectious conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, artherosclerosis and sepsis [8, [42] [43] [44] . Due to the role of KLF2 in regulation of monocytes activation, it has been further studied in these inflammatory diseases. Interestingly, in in vitro and in vivo disease models, KLF2 deficiency induces expression of proinflammatory cytokines expression, leads to abrupt monocyte activation/differentiation, osteoclastogenesis and mediated aggressive disease symptoms and has been of further extensive research interest, as discussed in detail in the disease section.", "citance": "The deregulated and prolonged activation of monocytes has deleterious effects in several inflammatory diseases and chronic infectious conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, artherosclerosis and sepsis [8, [42] [43] [44] .", "claims": [{"text": "The deregulated and prolonged activation of monocytes has deleterious effects in chronic infectious conditions.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "The deregulated and prolonged activation of monocytes has deleterious effects in inflammatory diseases.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "The deregulated and prolonged activation of monocytes improves inflammatory disease outcomes.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}

The design of new therapies based on natural killer (NK) cells opens new possibilities especially for the treatment of elderly patients who are particularly susceptible to the toxicity of conventional chemotherapy treatments. In recent years, the potential use of NK cells in cancer immunotherapy has been of great interest thanks to advances in the study of NK cell biology. The identification of key points (checkpoints) in the activation of NK cells that can be regulated by monoclonal antibodies has allowed the design of new therapeutic strategies based on NK cells. However, there are still limitations for its use and the first clinical trials blocking KIR inhibitory receptors have shown little efficacy by inhibiting the maturation of NK cells. Blockade of other inhibitory receptors such as TIGIT, TIM3, LAG3 and PD1 may represent novel strategies to increase NK function in cancer patients. Altogether, the identification of NK cell and tumour cell markers of resistance or susceptibility to the action of NK cells will contribute to identifying those patients that will most likely benefit from NK cell-based immunotherapy.", "citation_paragraph": "Anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 therapies have shown success in the treatment of some types of cancer, mainly in those expressing PD-L1 and with lymphocyte infiltration. In a recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, it has been shown that, compared with conventional agents, PD-1 or PD-L1 blockade is associated with prolonged overall survival in PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative patients. The long-term clinical benefits are observed independently of the interventional agent, cancer histotype, method of randomization stratification, type of immunohistochemical scoring system, drug target, type of control group, and median follow-up time. Nevertheless, the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade is higher in PD-L1-positive cancers than in PD-L1 negative [36] .Thus, it has been postulated that strategies aiming to increase PD-L1 expression should increase the efficacy of these treatments and improve the overall outcomes. Interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 induces PD-L1 expression on tumours, although, at least in an ovarian cancer model, the induction of PD-L1 coincides with the presence of regulatory T cells within tumours. In this experimental model the use of activated NK cells, that secrete high amounts of IFN-\u03b3 in combination with anti-PD-L1 significantly improves anti-tumour efficacy of NK cell-based adoptive immunotherapy, supporting the use of anti-PD-L1 in combination with NK cell therapy regardless of initial tumour PD-L1 status and indicate that NK cell therapy would likely augment the applicability of anti-PD-L1 treatment [37] .In addition to its effect enhancing anti-tumour T lymphocyte response, PD1/PD-L1 blockade also results in increased in vivo NK cell persistence and retention of their cytotoxic phenotype. Disrupting PD-1 inhibitory pathway with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies enhances NK cell functions against multiple myeloma cells [38] and improves IFN-\u03b3 release by NK cells [39] and partially restores the degranulation of PD-1 + NK cells in the presence of PD-L1 + target cells [40] .", "citance": "Nevertheless, the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade is higher in PD-L1-positive cancers than in PD-L1 negative [36] .Thus, it has been postulated that strategies aiming to increase PD-L1 expression should increase the efficacy of these treatments and improve the overall outcomes.", "claims": [{"text": "The efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade is higher in PD-L1-negative cancer than in PD-L1 positive.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "The efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade is higher in PD-L1-positive cancer than in PD-L1 negative.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 3472849, "title": "The Role of XPG in Processing (CAG)n/(CTG)n DNA Hairpins", "abstract": "BACKGROUND During DNA replication or repair, disease-associated (CAG)n/(CTG)n expansion can result from formation of hairpin structures in the repeat tract of the newly synthesized or nicked DNA strand. Recent studies identified a nick-directed (CAG)n/(CTG)n hairpin repair (HPR) system that removes (CAG)n/(CTG)n hairpins from human cells via endonucleolytic incisions. Because the process is highly similar to the mechanism by which XPG and XPF endonucleases remove bulky DNA lesions during nucleotide excision repair, we assessed the potential role of XPG in conducting (CAG)n/(CTG)n HPR.   RESULTS To determine if the XPG endonuclease is involved in (CAG)n/(CTG)n hairpin removal, two XPG-deficient cell lines (GM16024 and AG08802) were examined for their ability to process (CAG)n/(CTG)n hairpins in vitro. We demonstrated that the GM16024 cell line processes all hairpin substrates as efficiently as HeLa cells, and that the AG08802 cell line is partially defective in HPR. Analysis of repair intermediates revealed that nuclear extracts from both XPG-deficient lines remove CAG/CTG hairpins via incisions, but the incision products are distinct from those generated in HeLa extracts. We also show that purified recombinant XPG protein greatly stimulates HPR in XPG-deficient extracts by promoting an incision 5' to the hairpin.   CONCLUSIONS Our results strongly suggest that 1) human cells possess multiple pathways to remove (CAG)n/(CTG)n hairpins located in newly synthesized (or nicked) DNA strand; and 2) XPG, although not essential for (CAG)n/(CTG)n hairpin removal, stimulates HPR by facilitating a 5' incision to the hairpin. This study reveals a novel role for XPG in genome-maintenance and implicates XPG in diseases caused by trinucleotide repeat expansion.", "citation_paragraph": "In this study, we investigated the CAG/CTG HPR capacity of cells defective in XPG, which is one of the two endonucleases responsible for removing bulky DNA lesions via a dual incision mechanism [14, 15] . Two interesting observations are made: 1) although XPG is not essential for CAG/CTG hairpin removal, it directly or indirectly participates in HPR by stimulating hairpin cleavage; and 2) human cells possess multiple incision pathways for removing CAG/CTG hairpins formed in the newly synthesized (or nicked) DNA strand.Previous studies in HeLa nuclear extracts have revealed that CAG/CTG hairpins are mainly removed via endonucleolytic cleavages [13] . In this study, we show that incisions are also the primary mechanism by which XPGdeficient cells process CAG/CTG hairpins, which also supports the idea that NER enzymes are not essential for large loop or hairpin removal [12, 18] . Analysis of HPR intermediates reveals that these XPG-deficient cells appear to remove CAG/CTG hairpins formed in the template (i.e., non-nicked) DNA strand in a manner similar to HeLa cells, since almost identical incision products were observed in reactions with HeLa, AG08802, and GM16024 extracts for substrates V-(CTG) 25 and V-(CAG) 25 ( Figure 5A and 5B). However, the repair intermediates from two XPG mutants significantly differ from those in HeLa cells when processing hairpin structures formed in the nicked (or newly synthesized) DNA strand, i.e., substrates C-(CTG) 25 and C-(CAG) 25 ( Figure 5C and 5D). Interestingly, although these XPG mutants process substrate C-(CTG) 25 in an identical way ( Figure 5C ), they employed different mechanisms for C-(CAG) 25 hairpin removal ( Figure 5D ), suggesting that human cells possess multiple pathways for removing CAG/CTG hairpins formed in the newly synthesized DNA strand. However, the enzymes involved in these alternative pathways and the mechanisms regulating the pathway choice remain to be investigated. Given the difference in cell types (epithelium for HeLa, lymphoblast for AG08802, and lymphocyte for GM16024), it is possible that these pathways are tissue/cell type-specific.It is worth mentioning that despite a given cell extract showing a dominant HPR pathway for removing hairpins in the nicked strand, we did detect residual incision products of an alternative pathway in the same reaction -e.g., residual product II in the AG08802-containing reaction and residual product III in the HeLa-containing Figure 5 Human cells possess multiple HPR pathways for nick strand hairpins. HPR assays were performed in nuclear extracts from HeLa (HL), AG08802 (AG), or GM16024 (GM) under conditions of no DNA synthesis. The resulting DNA products were digested with BglI and BsmBI, and analyzed by Southern blot analysis using an oligonucleotide probe annealing to the nicked strand near the BglI site. The repair intermediates for substrates V-(CTG) 25 , V-(CAG) 25 , C-(CTG) 25 , and C-(CAG) 25 reaction ( Figure 4A ). Based on the status of XPG in these cells, it is reasonable to believe that XPG is preferentially responsible for the processing in HeLa cells, but an alternative pathway takes place in the absence of XPG (e.g., in AG08802 and GM16024 cells). However, exogenous XPG failed to restore product II to reactions with XPG-deficient extracts ( Figure 4A ; data for GM16024 are not shown). Previous studies have revealed that these mutant cell lines express abnormal XPG proteins [16, 17] . Thus, it is possible that these abnormal XPG proteins in AG08802 and GM16024 cells may have a dominant-negative role to inhibit the HPR pathway involving XPG by interacting with an XPG partner.We also show that although XPG is not required for CAG/CTG hairpin removal, exogenous XPG significantly stimulates HPR by promoting an incision 5' to the hairpin ( Figure 4 ). This is totally unexpected, because it is XPF, but not XPG, that conducts the 5' incision in NER [14, 15] . How XPG, which makes the 3' incision in NER, promotes an incision 5' to the hairpin in HPR is unclear. Previous studies have shown that XPG stimulates base excision repair by facilitating the recruitment of DNA glycosylase/lyase to the damage site [21, 22] . XPG was also shown to stabilize the TFIIH complex, thereby enhancing gene transcription [23] . The enzyme recruitment and stabilization activities associated with XPG could be responsible for its stimulation activity in HPR. Further studies are required to address these possibilities.", "citance": "XPG was also shown to stabilize the TFIIH complex, thereby enhancing gene transcription [23] .", "claims": [{"text": "The endonuclease XPG enhances gene transcription by stabilizing the TFIIH complex.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "The endonuclease XPG suppresses gene transcription by stabilizing the TFIIH complex.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}

{"s2orc_id": 4988235, "title": "Altered zinc sensitivity of NMDA receptors harboring clinically-relevant mutations.", "abstract": "Recent human genetic studies have identified a surprisingly high number of alterations in genes encoding NMDA receptor (NMDAR) subunits in several common brain diseases. Among NMDAR subunits, the widely-expressed GluN2A subunit appears particularly affected, with tens of de novo or inherited mutations associated with neurodevelopmental conditions including childhood epilepsies and cognitive deficits. Despite the increasing identification of NMDAR mutations of clinical interest, there is still little information about the effects of the mutations on receptor and network function. Here we analyze the impact on receptor expression and function of nine GluN2A missense (i.e. single-point) mutations targeting the N-terminal domain, a large regulatory region involved in subunit assembly and allosteric signaling. While several mutations produced no or little apparent effect on receptor expression, gating and pharmacology, two showed a drastic expression phenotype and two resulted in marked alterations in the sensitivity to zinc, a potent allosteric inhibitor of GluN1/GluN2A receptors and modulator of excitatory synaptic transmission. Surprisingly, both increase (GluN2A-R370W) and decrease (GluN2A-P79R) of zinc sensitivity were observed on receptors containing either one or two copies of the mutated subunits. Overexpression of the mutant subunits in cultured rat neurons confirmed the results from heterologous expression. These results, together with previously published data, indicate that disease-causing mutations in NMDARs produce a wide spectrum of receptor alterations, at least in vitro. They also point to a critical role of the zinc-NMDAR interaction in neuronal function and human health.", "citation_paragraph": "Besides subunit expression, our results unveil that zinc modulation is another conspicuous NMDAR property that is profoundly modified by specific sets of disease-linked mutations. Two mutations were found to alter GluN2A-mediated high-affinity zinc inhibition:P79R and R370W. While P79R diminishes zinc inhibition through a combined decrease in zinc 'efficacy' (i.e. decreased maximal level of inhibition) and 'affinity' (i.e. increased IC 50 ), R370W enhances zinc inhibition mostly through an 'affinity' effect. Both residues locate away from the predicted zinc binding site in the GluN2A NTD interlobe cleft (Figure 4 ; Hansen et al., 2010; Paoletti, 2011) , and likely mediate their effects on zinc sensitivity through distinct mechanisms. According to the GluN1/GluN2B NTD structure (Karakas et al., 2011) , GluN2A-R370 (which is conserved in GluN2B) interacts with a lower lobe loop which contains a residue critically involved in zinc binding (GluN2A-E266) ( Figure 4A ; Fayyazuddin et al., 2000) . Substitution of the arginine by a bulky hydrophobic tryptophan may favor a loop conformation which fortuitously results in enhanced zinc coordination. Such an effect would account for the observed slowing down of the zinc dissociation kinetics ( Figure 2C ). We propose that the mutation P79R acts differently. The homologous proline in GluN2B (GluN2B-P80; conserved in all four GluN2 subunits) locates at the edge of GluN2 NTD and makes extensive hydrophobic contacts with the neighboring GluN1 NTD ( Figure 4B ; Karakas et al., 2011) . Its replacement by a positively charged arginine likely disrupts this hydrophobic cluster. We thus hypothesize that in GluN2A receptors the P79R mutation affects zinc (and proton) sensitivity indirectly, at least in part, by altering NTD dimerization. We have no clear explanation for why this mutation, which decreases zinc sensitivity but enhances proton sensitivity, deviates from the rule that positively correlates proton and zinc sensitivity in GluN2A receptors (Choi and Lipton, 1999; Gielen et al., 2008; Low et al., 2000) . We speculate that this unexpected result finds its origin both in the location of P79 at a specific subunit-subunit interface and in the nature of the substitution (a positively-charged arginine).The two factors may result in a reduced zinc-NTD interaction together with a 'distorted' GluN1-GluN2A NTD dimer configuration stabilizing a (proton favorable) inhibited state of the M A N U S C R I P T", "citance": "The homologous proline in GluN2B (GluN2B-P80; conserved in all four GluN2 subunits) locates at the edge of GluN2 NTD and makes extensive hydrophobic contacts with the neighboring GluN1 NTD ( Figure 4B ; Karakas et al., 2011) .", "claims": [{"text": "The homologous proline in GluN2B makes hydrophobic contact with GluN1 NTD.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

CASE PRESENTATION A 87-year old patient developed pericarditis after influenza vaccination, with acute chest pain, without ECG abnormalities or increased cardiac enzyme levels. Echocardiogram showed moderate pericardial effusion. Recovery was obtained through steroids One year later, few days after re-immunization, the patient experienced the same symptoms and was admitted to hospital with diagnosis of recurrence of pericarditis with severe pericardial effusion, again treated with steroids. Other possible causes were ruled out and the cardiologist recommended against influenza vaccinations in the future; the patient did not experience recurrence of pericarditis in the following 6 years. Cases of pericarditis following influenza immunization in the literature were also reviewed.   CONCLUSIONS Pericarditis following immunization for influenza is very rarely reported in the literature. In a few cases, influenza vaccination seems likely responsible. We suggest considering recent immunization in patient's history as part of the differential diagnosis in elderly with chest pain.", "citation_paragraph": "Annual vaccination is an important public health measure to prevent influenza because influenza viruses change their antigenic characteristics frequently and may easily spread in the population [5] [6] [7] [8] . In particular, elderly population (\u226565 years old) and individuals with underlying diseases have either higher risk of complications of influenza and death. In these categories, influenza vaccine reduces dramatically both influenza occurrence and the severity of the illness [9, 10] . Moreover, influenza vaccine in older people is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular events, especially in those with underlying cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. coronary disease) [11] . Annual immunization against influenza also reduces risk of death particularly in previously immunized [12] subjects.Pericarditis typically presents with chest pain (> 85-90% of cases), pericardial friction rub (\u226433% of cases), ECG changes (up to 60% of cases), increased cardiac enzymes and markers of inflammation (i.e. C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and white blood cell count). Recurrent pericarditis is diagnosed when a symptom-free interval of 4-6 weeks or longer separates the first episode of pericarditis. Recurrence occurs in 15-30% of cases after an initial episode, and may increase to 50% after a first recurrence in patients not treated with colchicine, particularly if treated with corticosteroids [13] .We searched MEDLINE in February 2017 for case reports/series, by combining the following key-words: \"influenza\", \"vaccine\", \"immunization\" and \"pericarditis\", without language restrictions. Six case reports (7 patients) of pericarditis after influenza immunization were identified: of these, 4 patients aged more than 60 years, mean time of symptom onset was 7 days, outcome was favorable in all the cases (recovery). According to the authors, a positive association between pericarditis and vaccine was defined in 4 cases, while 3 cases resulted with a \"possible\" association. In only one case, recurrence of pericarditis after influenza immunization reported, about 2 years after the first episode. Further details are shown in Table 1 . Only one case described a patient with recurrent pericarditis after influenza vaccination in two consecutive years [14] . Interestingly, Zanettini et al. compared 84 patients with pericarditis, divided into two groups; patients immunized with influenza vaccine, compared with patients not immunized, had a typical seasonal distribution with a peak in autumn, fewer comorbidities, less exuberant signs and symptoms, and clinical relief with NSAIDs use [15] . Considering the widespread use of influenza vaccination (approximately two of every five children and adults in the United States were vaccinated by early November 2016) [16] , the occurrence of iatrogenic pericarditis is an extremely rare complication. However, in the light of the described event and the series reported by Zanettini et We described a rare case of pericarditis following immunization, which did not meet the typical clinical and laboratory presentation. The underlying chronic diseases of the elderly patient (ischemic cardiomyopathy, permanent atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and mild chronic kidney failure) do not fully explain pericarditis, although they probably contributed to its appearance (e.g. use of anticoagulant therapy). We cannot exclude that a recurrent viral infection could have caused the pericarditis episodes, because no specific viral studies were performed to systematically rule out viral etiologies of pericarditis. Nonetheless, hepatitis and HIV infections were excluded, as well as bacterial infections, since laboratory data and pericardial fluid culture were negative. These findings, together with positive rechallenge (re-administration one year after the first event with event re-occurrence) are key elements to define the association with influenza vaccine as \"correlated\" by WHO-AEFI (Adverse event Following Immunization) algorithm [20] . Moreover, the patient was monitored for the following 6 years during which influenza vaccination was not performed and no recurrence of pericarditis was reported (positive de-challenge). This is in line with Engler et al. [21] who strengthened the importance of active long-term surveillance.In conclusion, although under-reporting can be supposed, the rarity of pericarditis after immunization does not affect the already established positive benefit-risk profile of influenza vaccine (and of vaccines in general). However, considering the high prevalence of pericarditis of undetermined origin, episodes of recent immunization should be highlighted in patient's history to support differential diagnosis.

{"s2orc_id": 6390997, "title": "Latency-Associated Viral Interleukin-10 (IL-10) Encoded by Human Cytomegalovirus Modulates Cellular IL-10 and CCL8 Secretion during Latent Infection through Changes in the Cellular MicroRNA hsa-miR-92a", "abstract": "UNLABELLED The UL111A gene of human cytomegalovirus encodes a viral homologue of the cellular immunomodulatory cytokine interleukin 10 (cIL-10), which, due to alternative splicing, results in expression of two isoforms designated LAcmvIL-10 (expressed during both lytic and latent infection) and cmvIL-10 (identified only during lytic infection). We have analyzed the functions of LAcmvIL-10 during latent infection of primary myeloid progenitor cells and found that LAcmvIL-10 is responsible, at least in part, for the known increase in secretion of cellular IL-10 and CCL8 in the secretomes of latently infected cells. This latency-associated increase in CCL8 expression results from a concomitant LAcmvIL-10-mediated suppression of the expression of the cellular microRNA (miRNA) hsa-miR-92a, which targets CCL8 directly. Taking the data together, we show that the previously observed downregulation of hsa-miR-92a and upregulation of CCL8 during HCMV latent infection of myeloid cells are intimately linked via the latency-associated expression of LAcmvIL-10.   IMPORTANCE HCMV latency causes significant morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised individuals, yet HCMV is carried silently (latently) in 50 to 90% of the population. Understanding how HCMV maintains infection for the lifetime of an infected individual is critical for the treatment of immunocompromised individuals suffering with disease as a result of HCMV. In this study, we analyze one of the proteins that are expressed during the \"latent\" phase of HCMV, LAcmvIL-10, and find that the expression of the gene modulates the microenvironment of the infected cell, leading to evasion of the immune system.", "citation_paragraph": "he species-specific human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is widespread within the human population: estimates of seroprevalence vary between 50% and 90%, depending on socioeconomic factors (1) . In healthy individuals, a robust T cell response to primary infection is believed to ensure that clinical symptoms rarely occur. However, like all herpesviruses, HCMV persists for life, and this is mediated, at least in part, by its ability to enter a latent life cycle (2, 3) .In general, latent infection of otherwise healthy carriers is also asymptomatic, as is the sporadic reactivation of the virus, which is believed to occur routinely in latently infected individuals in vivo. However, in immunocompromised individuals (including AIDS patients and transplant recipients), primary infection, as well as reactivation from latency, carries a risk of severe morbidity and mortality (2, 3) .The differences between lytic and latent infection with HCMV are striking. Lytic infection is initiated by the expression of virusencoded immediate-early (IE) genes; the subsequent expression of viral early (often viral DNA replication-associated) and late (often viral packaging-associated) genes is followed by the release of infectious virions. A number of cell types support lytic infection, including fibroblasts and endothelial cells, and this occurs over 48 to 72 h in vitro (4) . Conversely, in certain cell types, such as undifferentiated monocytes and their CD34 \u03e9 progenitors, latent infection can be established. During latency, the lytic transcription program is heavily suppressed. This results in a lack of production of infectious virions, and viral gene expression is restricted to a substantially reduced number of latency-associated transcripts (2, 3, (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . However, these latently infected cells can reactivate virus as a result of their differentiation into macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) (2, 3) .Despite a profoundly limited viral transcription profile, a substantial number of changes in cellular gene expression are known to occur during latent infection of myeloid cells with HCMV (12) (13) (14) , including changes to cellular microRNAs (miRNAs) (15) , as well as changes to the cellular secretome (16, 17) . For example, in latently infected CD34 \u03e9 cells, the upregulation of the cellular chemokine CCL8 acts as a CD4 \u03e9 T cell chemoattractant, but concomitant increases in latency-associated secretion of other immunomodulatory factors, such as transforming growth factor \u2424 (TGF-\u2424) and cellular interleukin 10 (cIL-10), neutralizes the effector functions of these recruited T cells (16) . Although latencyassociated regulation of the cellular miRNA hsa-miR-92a has been implicated in the control of cIL-10 expression during latency (15) , how latent infection modulates expression of, e.g., CCL8 is far from clear.Intriguingly, although latent HCMV infection robustly induces expression of cIL-10, the virus also encodes IL-10 homo-logues. Two isoforms of virus-encoded IL-10 are generated by alternative splicing from the viral UL111A gene. One of these is a protein of 175 amino acids, termed cmvIL-10, which is expressed during lytic infection and has the expression kinetics of a late gene (18) (19) (20) . The second isoform, predicted to consist of 139 amino acids and termed LAcmvIL-10, has a C-terminal truncation and is expressed during both lytic and latent infection (11, (21) (22) (23) . HCMV is not the only CMV that encodes a cellular IL-10 homologue. An IL-10 homologue encoded by the UL111A open reading frame (ORF) has also been identified in rhesus macaque CMV (RhCMV). Although it has a slightly different gene structure than cmvIL-10, like cmvIL-10, it shows low amino acid identity to host cellular .Although the full-length cmvIL-10 gene has only 27% amino acid identity to the human cIL-10 gene, cmvIL-10 has a number of functions in common with cIL-10: it forms homodimers and binds the cIL-10 receptor (24); it triggers STAT3 phosphorylation and activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway (23, 25) ; it signals via the phosphoinositide-3-kinase pathway, contributing to cytokine suppression (26) ; and it shares the ability of cIL-10 to prevent NF-B activity via inhibition of IKK (26) .In contrast, LAcmvIL-10 appears quite dissimilar to cIL-10 and cmvIL-10. Although, like cIL-10 and cmvIL-10, it can downregulate major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II in latently infected granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMPs) (11, 22) , it either does not signal through the IL-10 receptor (IL-10R) or it engages the receptor in a different way than cIL-10 and cmvIL-10 (23). Consequently, there is a dearth of knowledge regarding the functions of LAcmvIL-10 during latency.We now show that, during latent infection of myeloid cells, LAcmvIL-10 mediates the known latency-associated increase in secreted cellular CCL8 and that this is due to concomitant suppression by LAcmvIL-10 of expression of the cellular miRNA hsamiR-92a, which in itself contributes to a number of effects during latency (15) , as well as targeting CCL8 directly.", "citance": "However, these latently infected cells can reactivate virus as a result of their differentiation into macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) (2, 3) .Despite a profoundly limited viral transcription profile, a substantial number of changes in cellular gene expression are known to occur during latent infection of myeloid cells with HCMV (12) (13) (14) , including changes to cellular microRNAs (miRNAs) (15) , as well as changes to the cellular secretome (16, 17) .", "claims": [{"text": "The latent infection of myeloid cells with human cytomegalovirus induces a number of changes in gene expression.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 30448, "title": "A Pathway-Centric Survey of Somatic Mutations in Chinese Patients with Colorectal Carcinomas", "abstract": "Previous genetic studies on colorectal carcinomas (CRC) have identified multiple somatic mutations in four candidate pathways (TGF-\u03b2, Wnt, P53 and RTK-RAS pathways) on populations of European ancestry. However, it is under-studied whether other populations harbor different sets of hot-spot somatic mutations in these pathways and other oncogenes. In this study, to evaluate the mutational spectrum of novel somatic mutations, we assessed 41 pairs of tumor-stroma tissues from Chinese patients with CRC, including 29 colon carcinomas and 12 rectal carcinomas. We designed Illumina Custom Amplicon panel to target 43 genes, including genes in the four candidate pathways, as well as several known oncogenes for other cancers. Candidate mutations were validated by Sanger sequencing, and we further used SIFT and PolyPhen-2 to assess potentially functional mutations. We discovered 3 new somatic mutations in gene APC, TCF7L2, and PIK3CA that had never been reported in the COSMIC or NCI-60 databases. Additionally, we confirmed 6 known somatic mutations in gene SMAD4, APC, FBXW7, BRAF and PTEN in Chinese CRC patients. While most were previously reported in CRC, one mutation in PTEN was reported only in malignant endometrium cancer. Our study confirmed the existence of known somatic mutations in the four candidate pathways for CRC in Chinese patients. We also discovered a number of novel somatic mutations in these pathways, which may have implications for the pathogenesis of CRC.", "citation_paragraph": "Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in males yet the second in females, and the World Health Organization GLOBOCAN database reported approximately 1.2 million new cancer cases and more than 608,000 deaths globally in 2008 [1] . The molecular genetic mechanism underlying CRC tumorigenesis appear to be multifactorial [2, 3] . Substantial studies discovered that CRC arises as a result of the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations [4] , including loss of genomic stability, microsatellite instability, aberrant DNA methylation and DNA repair defects, which highlight the heterogeneity of the disease, besides the controllable contributors such as dietary and lifestyle factors [5, 6] .Earlier generation of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified 8q24, 11q23, 18q21, 10p14 and 8q23.3 as susceptibility loci of CRC [7] [8] [9] , but more recently, over 20 additional loci such as rs647161 (5q31.1), rs2423279 (20p12.3) and rs10774214 (12p13.32) were discovered to be associated with CRC [10] . These results from GWAS confirmed the heritability of CRC initiation [11, 12] . On the other hand, rare germline mutation of the APC gene was found in both sporadic CRC [13] and familial adenomatous polyposis [14] , and other studies implied that high-penetrant germline mutations of the MSH2 and MLH1gene [15] may account for hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer [16] .In addition to germline variants that confer susceptibility to CRCs, genome-wide analysis of mutations in CRCs has identified acquired somatic mutations in several hundred genes, with an average of 80 mutations in any single patient with CRC [2, 17] . Importantly, somatic mutations in TGF-\u03b2, Wnt, APC, TP53 and RTK-RAS pathways were identified to be important contributors to CRC development [18] . Among them, APC was proposed to be a gatekeeper to regulate epithelial cells to develop into the adenoma and even carcinoma cells [19] , yet alteration of TP53 was proposed to be a relatively late event in the development of colorectal tumor. Without P53-mediation, cell apoptosis signal losts exertion of cell cycle control and may result in the progression from adenoma to malignant tumor [20] . Recently, with the development of next generation sequencing techniques, a series of somatic point mutations and rearrangements of oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes (TSG) underlying the tumorigenesis of CRC were confirmed, prominently the genes APC [21] , K-ras [22] , and TP53 [23] . Additionally, somatic mutations in genes SMAD2, SMAD3 and SMAD4 had also been identified in previous CRC studies [24] .Although the genetic alterations associated with CRC had been extensively studied, the incidence of CRC varies widely between worldwide populations. Statistically, around 60% of cases are diagnosed in the developed world [25] , and the highest incidence rates are found in North America and Europe, Australia and New Zealand, while the lowest rates are in Africa and South-Central Asia [1] . Besides environmental factors, this implies that different genetic background may play a role in CRC susceptibility, and that different patterns of somatic mutations may contribute to CRC progression. Additionally, a recent study identified novel DNA variants of hMLH1 and hMSH2 genes in Chinese CRC patients [26] . Therefore, in this study, we selected 41 paired tumor-stroma tissues from the Chinese CRC patients representing all grades, to explore the patterns of somatic mutations in the four candidate pathways and in oncogenes for other cancer types, and to complete the understanding of somatic mutation in CRC patients.", "citance": "Substantial studies discovered that CRC arises as a result of the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations [4] , including loss of genomic stability, microsatellite instability, aberrant DNA methylation and DNA repair defects, which highlight the heterogeneity of the disease, besides the controllable contributors such as dietary and lifestyle factors [5, 6] .Earlier generation of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified 8q24, 11q23, 18q21, 10p14 and 8q23.3 as susceptibility loci of CRC [7] [8] [9] , but more recently, over 20 additional loci such as rs647161 (5q31.1), rs2423279 (20p12.3) and rs10774214 (12p13.32) were discovered to be associated with CRC [10] .", "claims": [{"text": "The locus rs647161 is associated with colorectal carcinoma.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Young women, who lack social supports, have experienced recurrent pregnancy loss or a history of trauma and / or preexisting psychiatric illness are at a higher risk of experiencing psychiatric illnesses or symptoms after a perinatal loss or during infertility. It is especially important to detect, assess, and treat depression, anxiety, or other psychiatric symptoms because infertility or perinatal loss may be caused or perpetuated by such symptoms. Screening, psychoeducation, provision of resources and referrals, and an opportunity to discuss their loss and plan for future pregnancies can facilitate addressing mental health concerns that arise. Women at risk of or who are currently experiencing psychiatric symptoms should receive a comprehensive treatment plan that includes the following: (1) proactive clinical monitoring, (2) evidence-based approaches to psychotherapy, and (3) discussion of risks, benefits, and alternatives of medication treatment during preconception and pregnancy.", "citation_paragraph": "Understanding and addressing psychological aspects of perinatal loss is critical because of the psychological reactions of women (grief, depression, anxiety, PTSD, suicide) and the impact on subsequent pregnancies and relationships with partners and surviving siblings [58, 59] .Grief The grief that follows miscarriage often declines significantly by 6 months for both men and women, yet sometimes persists for up to 2 years [60, 61] . Perinatal loss leads to complicated grief more frequently than other losses [62] . Several factors may contribute to this. Pregnancy loss is often sudden and unexpected. The grief that parents experience after early pregnancy loss is often Bdisenfranchised^ [63] ; it is often not openly acknowledged or socially supported. Perinatal loss is associated with guilt or self-blame, and women may feel that their bodies have failed.Predictors of complicated grief following perinatal loss include lack of social support, preloss major depression, ambivalence about pregnancy, and termination of pregnancy for fetal anomaly. Termination of pregnancy for fetal anomaly is associated with higher levels of self-blame, guilt, and social isolation [64] . Other factors that have been reported as predictive in some, but not all studies [65] , include older maternal age, having viewed an ultrasound, having experienced quickening (fetal movement), having named the baby or bought things for the baby, and length of gestation [60, 65] . Whether miscarriage is managed medically or surgically does not have a bearing on the intensity or duration of grief [66] . The presence of living children is protective against grief after perinatal loss. The perinatal loss of a co-twin or a higher order pregnancy is associated with unique challenges such as enduring the trauma of prolonged hospitalization for the surviving twin and keeping grief Bon hold^to support the surviving baby [67] .Grief following perinatal loss is a normal phenomenon. Nonetheless, women, especially those with risk factors, should be monitored for prolonged or complicated grief and persistence of depression, anxiety, or posttraumatic symptoms.Depression It is important to distinguish grief from complicated grief and depression because there is significant overlap between the symptoms of psychiatric disorder and grief. Women who experience a perinatal loss have fourfold higher odds than women with a live birth of screening positive for depression [68\u2022] . Risk factors for persisting depression/ psychological distress after miscarriage are infertility treatment [69] , recurrent pregnancy loss, prior history of depression [70] , prior PTSD, intimate partner violence (IPV) [68\u2022] , and high levels of distress immediately after miscarriage [71] . There is also a higher risk of inpatient or outpatient psychiatric treatment 12 months after fetal death. The highest risk is for women with a loss occurring after 20 weeks of gestation, and the most commonly reported psychiatric disorder is adjustment disorder [72] . However, 5 to 18 years after intrauterine fetal death (IUFD), there are no significant increases in depression scores [73] . Thus, while women with recurrent miscarriages and a past history of depression and fetal death after 20 weeks of gestation are at a high risk of depression/ adjustment disorder in the year following perinatal loss, this risk declines subsequently.Anxiety Perinatal loss is associated with an increased risk of anxiety in the first 4 months after loss [74] . Even having a living child has not been shown to protect against anxiety in women with a history of miscarriage. In longitudinal studies, this anxiety has been shown to be significantly greater than the general population at 10 days following the miscarriage, but not at 6 months, 2, or 5 years [75] . At 9 months after perinatal death (stillbirth and infant death), women with perinatal death had more than twice the odds for generalized anxiety disorder and social phobia even after adjusting for demographic factors, current depression, and past h/o psychiatric disorders [76] . Given that only 28 % of bereaved mothers with anxiety symptoms access psychiatric treatment [76] , it is critical that women are screened, assessed, and linked with mental health care. Suicide While the term Bmaternal mortality^is usually associated with obstetrical causes such as postpartum hemorrhage and pulmonary embolism, suicide also confers risk for maternal mortality. The mean annual suicide rate is higher (18.1 per 100,000) in the first year after miscarriage than after live birth (5.9) or in the general population (11.3) [78] . Registry studies have estimated a 50 % increased risk of suicide in parents who lost a child between the ages of 0 and 18 [79] . Stillbirth or neonatal death has not been associated with higher maternal suicide in other studies [80] .", "citance": "The mean annual suicide rate is higher (18.1 per 100,000) in the first year after miscarriage than after live birth (5.9) or in the general population (11.3) [78] .", "claims": [{"text": "The mean suicide rate in women is higher after miscarriage than in the general population.", "subject": "The mean suicide rate", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "The mean suicide rate in women is higher after miscarriage than live birth.

{"s2orc_id": 52935635, "title": "Regulation of obesity\u2010associated metabolic disturbance by the antipsychotic drug olanzapine: Role of the autophagy\u2010lysosome pathway", "abstract": "&NA; Metabolic disturbance is commonly observed in schizophrenia patients, and the metabolic impacts of atypical antipsychotics such as olanzapine (OLA) have received much attention. Drug naive schizophrenia patients display metabolic abnormality to varying degrees, but how this shapes the metabolic responses to chronic OLA exposure is unknown. Using high\u2010fat diet (HFD, 8 weeks) induced obesity, here we explored the metabolic outcome of chronic OLA exposure in conditions of pre\u2010existing metabolic disturbance. OLA treatment (2 mg/kg) for 4 weeks led to markedly reduced body weight and adiposity in obese mice, concomitant with reduced adipose inflammation and hepatic steatosis. No significant change was observed on insulin sensitivity or energy expenditure after OLA exposure. Mechanistically, OLA restored autophagic clearance in the subcutaneous adipose tissue of obese mice, in line with its potentiation of lysosomal function in adipocytes. The metabolic phenotypes induced by OLA were partially reversed by chemical suppression of autolysosome. Together, these data uncover distinct metabolic effects of OLA in obesity involving the regulation of adipose tissue autophagy, and suggest a complicated link between OLA therapy and metabolic disturbance in schizophrenia.", "citation_paragraph": "on the WAT, which exhibited universal reductions in weight and adipocyte size. However, when examined at the level of inflammatory mediators, OLA seemed to predominantly take effect on the iWAT, while not affecting those at the eWAT. The WAT contains white and brown adipocytes that are functionally complementary and inter-convertible [34, 35] . The morphology change from large-size white adipocytes to smaller brown adipocytes is usually accepted as a hallmark of increased energy expenditure potential in the WAT [35] . Of interest, no significant changes were found on brown fat-specific markers at iWAT or eWAT, despite a clear change of adipocyte morphology in the WAT of OLA-treated mice. This finding may partially explain why OLA treatment did not change the metabolic rates of mice to an appreciable extent. However, since the animal number used in the statistical analysis was not adequate, it is prudent to suggest that future studies including more animals each group may give more precise insights into the regulatory effect of OLA on WAT metabolism. Autophagic dysfunction has been described in patients and animal models of obesity, although there is still no consensus on whether this is suppressed or enhanced [13, 15, 36] . In our study, the accumulation of both LC3-II and p62 in the WAT of obese mice indicates impaired autophagic flux, which is supported by recent reports on mice and human samples [13, 36] . We found that OLA directly increased autophagic flux in cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes and promoted the release of mature CTSL, which was inhibited in obesity [13] . Importantly, our study showed that OLA was capable of restoring lysosomal function in the iWAT, and inhibition of lysosomal function by CQ partially blunted some of the metabolic effects of OLA in obesity. These data suggest that correcting autophagy defects in the WAT may contribute to the metabolic benefits of OLA, although more data from CQ-treated obese mice and LC3 puncta in adipocytes would be helpful to define this specific mechanism. Recent evidence also shed light on the metabolic benefits of pancreatic autophagy stimulation in obesity and diabetes, further linking autophagic flux with systemic metabolic benefits [37, 38] . Meanwhile, autophagy deficiency in the liver or skeletal muscle was previously shown to protect from obesity and insulin resistance [39] , suggesting that metabolic impact of autophagy may vary in a tissuedependent manner. This raises an interesting question of tissue-dependent autophagy regulation by OLA and organ crosstalk in orchestrating systemic energy metabolism in conditions of metabolic disturbance. Mechanistically, functional derangement of the autophagylysosomal pathway has been linked with cellular events such as cell senescence, cell death and inflammasome activation [14] . These emerging insights suggest an intriguing perspective to further understand the metabolic effects of OLA via tissue-dependent autophagy.Previous studies have largely focused on central effects of OLA to explain its metabolic effects. For example, central delivery of OLA was previously shown to induce hepatic insulin resistance and gluconeogenesis [40] . However, based on the results of our study, it is logical to suggest that the central actions of OLA may integrate with its peripheral effects to determine the net impact on energy metabolism. Indeed, several metabolomic studies have shown the value to examine the abnormalities of metabolite compositions in the periphery among patients with schizophrenia [41] . Moreover, although central 5-HTR 2C is known to increase appetite and weight gain, it has become clear that peripheral 5-HT actually functions as a suppressor of energy expenditure in conditions of high-fat diet (HFD) induced obesity [42] [43] [44] .In consideration of the brain-periphery interplay in energy metabolism, antagonism of peripheral 5-HT signaling, which plays a dominant role in metabolic disturbance underlying obesity [45] , may explain the contradictory effect of OLA before and after the establishment of obesity. As such, more attention is deserved on peripheral markers for energy metabolism that may shed more light on the action of OLA. Psychopathology factors have rarely been incorporated in current preclinical studies focusing on the metabolic effects of OLA. Since schizophrenia per se is associated with a higher propensity for metabolic syndrome [3, 46] , there is still debate whether psychiatric factors contribute to the occurrence of metabolic syndrome during OLA intake. In contrast to previous studies, our results uncovered some non-adverse effects of OLA in diet-induced obesity, further suggesting pathophysiological context-dependent impacts on energy metabolism. The clinical relevance of our findings for comorbid mental and metabolic disturbance deserves more investigation. Since our study is conducted in male mice, several factors deserve consideration concerning the clinical translatability. OLA has a relatively short half-life in mice (several hours), and the impact of pharmacokinetic behavior on metabolic effects should be considered. Indeed, a better approach to answer this question would have been to use mini-osmotic pumps to deliver the drug, as has been exemplified by Schmidt et al. [45] . Another factor to consider is gender, which was previously shown to shape the susceptibility to certain side effects of antipsychotics especially weight gain [18] . Therefore, how chronic OLA may affect body weight gain in female mice/rats after HFD-induced obesity is yet to be explored in future studies. Also, more data from normal controls, especially concerning autophagy regulation, are desirable to better interpret the current findings and its implicationsIn conclusion, we demonstrate in this study that OLA exposure, when obesity has been established, is not associated with untoward metabolic effects in mice. Moreover, restoration of impaired autophagic flux in obesity is critically involved in the alleviation of adiposity accumulation and liver injury by OLA. These results are contrary to the previous suggestions that OLA would worsen glucose and lipid metabolism in conditions of metabolic stress. Thus, the effect of OLA on energy metabolism is pathophysiology-dependent and might be more complicated than previously thought. We suggest that the versatile role of autophagy in energy metabolism might underlie the differential metabolic effects OLA observed under normal versus obese conditions. Further studies are required to address the clinical relevance of our findings, which may provide new insights into metabolic disturbance associated with schizophrenia and OLA-based antipsychotic therapy.", "citance": "The morphology change from large-size white adipocytes to smaller brown adipocytes is usually accepted as a hallmark of increased energy expenditure potential in the WAT [35] .", "claims": [{"text": "The morphology change from large white adipocytes to small brown adipocytes is a sign of decreased energy expenditure potential in white adipose tissue.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "The morphology change from large white adipocytes to small brown adipocytes is a sign of increased energy expenditure potential in white adipose tissue.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Obesity was not recognized as a chronic disease until 1985 by the scientific community, and 2013 by the medical community. Pharmacotherapy for obesity has advanced remarkably since the first class of drugs, amphetamines, were approved for short-term use. Most amphetamines were removed from the obesity market due to adverse events and potential for addiction, and it became apparent that obesity pharmacotherapies were needed that could safely be administered over the long term. This review of central nervous system (CNS) acting anti-obesity drugs evaluates current therapies such as phentermine/topiramate, which act through multiple neurotransmitter pathways to reduce appetite. In the synergistic mechanism of bupropion/naltrexone, naltrexone blocks the feed-back inhibitory circuit of bupropion to give greater weight loss. Lorcaserin, a selective agonist of a serotonin receptor that regulates food intake, and the glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist liraglutide are reviewed. Future drugs include tesofensine, a potent triple reuptake inhibitor in Phase III trials for obesity, and semaglutide, an oral GLP-1 analog approved for diabetes and currently in trials for obesity. Another potential new pharmacotherapy, setmelanotide, is a melanocortin-4 receptor agonist, which is still in an early stage of development.

{"s2orc_id": 13941904, "title": "Origin and evolution of the unique hepatitis C virus circulating recombinant form 2k/1b.", "abstract": "Since its initial identification in St. Petersburg, Russia, the recombinant hepatitis C virus (HCV) 2k/1b has been isolated from several countries throughout Eurasia. The 2k/1b strain is the only recombinant HCV to have spread widely, raising questions about the epidemiological background in which it first appeared. In order to further understand the circumstances by which HCV recombinants might be formed and spread, we estimated the date of the recombination event that generated the 2k/1b strain using a Bayesian phylogenetic approach. Our study incorporates newly isolated 2k/1b strains from Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and has employed a hierarchical Bayesian framework to combine information from different genomic regions. We estimate that 2k/1b originated sometime between 1923 and 1956, substantially before the first detection of the strain in 1999. The timescale and the geographic spread of 2k/1b suggest that it originated in the former Soviet Union at about the time that the world's first centralized national blood transfusion and storage service was being established. We also reconstructed the epidemic history of 2k/1b using coalescent theory-based methods, matching patterns previously reported for other epidemic HCV subtypes. This study demonstrates the practicality of jointly estimating dates of recombination from flanking regions of the breakpoint and further illustrates that rare genetic-exchange events can be particularly informative about the underlying epidemiological processes.", "citation_paragraph": "An illustration to explain the structure of the joint phylogenetic method that we employed to estimate the date of the recombination event that generated CRF01_1b2k.

The left axis depicts the time of the ancestral nodes (node B in the core/E1 tree and node C in the NS5B tree). The right axis shows the TMRCA of CRF01_1b2k (node A). Both CRF node A (estimated jointly from the core/E1 and NS5B regions) and the youngest parental node (either B or C) were used to calculate the minimum time window for the recombination event to have occurred.restricting the opportunities for HCV to generate CRFs. Mixed infections with divergent HCV strains have been reported for many different populations and are noted to be prevalent among high-risk groups, particularly IDUs and some hemophiliacs (3, 5, 16, 50, 53) . Since the opportunities for HCV recombination are not limited, it is more likely that fundamental molecular and evolutionary differences between HIV and HCV explain why HIV has many CRFs and HCV has few. These could include differences in the rate of template switching or differences in genomic or immunological constraints, such that HCV recombinants have, on average, lower fitness than HIV recombinants and therefore are rarely transmitted (72) . Although both viruses are associated with chronic infections, unlike HIV, HCV can be spontaneously cleared by the host. This may explain in part the differences in the number of recombinants between HIV and HCV, where partial protective immunity against the latter reduces that chance of in vivo recombination of HCV strains (1, 43, 69) . However, the high rate of mixed infections observed suggests that this is likely at best to play a minor role in HCV recombination. The low frequency of HCV recombinants is more likely to reflect mechanistic constraints on viral replication. There is evidence that template switching in HCV is (Table 1) . Filled circles/diamonds, 2k/1b isolates that were confirmed as being recombinant by sequencing of the breakpoint in the NS2 region; open circles/diamonds, those isolates for which NS2 sequences were not available. The numbers above the branches show the posterior probability of nodes in the MCC tree; numbers below the branches represent bootstrap support values using maximum likelihood. especially rare and that the replication complex is typically encoded on the same genomic strand that it will replicate and transcribe (2) . It is also interesting that when replication complexes are exchanged between different genotypes, the replication efficiency is substantially reduced (15) . The pseudodiploidy of the HIV genome certainly increases the likelihood of recombination occurring due to the ability of the virus to package two RNA templates (17) , while the secondary RNA structure in the HCV genome may limit the production of viable hybrid HCVs (59, 68) .Our study of previously reported and newly obtained HCV isolates provides the first estimates of the date of the recombination event that generated CRF01_1b2k. We estimated the time of origin of CRF01_1b2k to be between 1923 and 1956, which is not much later than the origin and global spread of the parental subtype 1b (33) . This date is significantly earlier than we expected: we expected that the CRF's creation might be linked to the dramatic increase in IDU behavior following the breakup of the former Soviet Union. This result is robust to the manner of isolate sampling: if, because of nonrandom sampling, our isolates are more closely related to each other than under random sampling, then the TMRCA of CRF01_1b2k would be biased toward more recent dates. Furthermore, despite its small size, our data set provides a relatively short time window during which the recombinant must have arisen (Fig. 2) . The involvement of subtype 1b in the recombinant is not surprising, as it is one of the most prevalent subtypes worldwide. However, to fully appreciate the origin of CRF01_1b2k, we need to consider the evolutionary history of both parental subtypes and of the recombinant lineage itself. Genotype 2 harbors considerable genetic diversity, especially in West Africa, which is where the genotype is thought to have originated (34) . Although the small number of subtype 2k isolates sampled to date likely underestimates the true extent of subtype 2k distribution, such viruses have been isolated from Martinique and Madagascar, implicating a role for the historical trans-Atlantic slave trade in the dissemination of the virus from West Africa (34) .The current distribution of subtype 2k is associated with francophone regions and former Soviet Union countries. In contrast, CRF01_1b2k is more spatially limited, with all isolates being directly or indirectly linked to the former Soviet Union. As the nonrecombinant subtype 2k isolates that are most closely related to CRF01_1b2k are from Moldova and Azerbaijan (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material), it seems most likely that CRF01_1b2k was generated in the former Soviet Union. An equivalent analysis of subtype 1b viruses provides no reliable phylogeographic linkage, due to the low phylogenetic resolution of the NS5B data set.Our estimated date of CRF origin coincides with an interesting period of history in the former Soviet Union, which was an early leader in transfusion technology. Under the leadership of Alexander Bogdanov in the 1920s, a nationwide network of blood transfusion centers and research institutes, as well as the Central Institute of Hematology in Moscow, Russia, in 1926, was established throughout the Soviet republics (61) . This expanded into a network of \u03f31,500 blood donating centers across the republics (18) . The Soviets also adopted blood storage and preservation techniques at an early stage. They established more than 60 primary and 500 subsidiary blood storage centers by the mid-1930s, which shipped blood across the entire Soviet Union (61) . During the Second World War, these networks were swiftly readapted to support the front line; in Moscow alone, about 2,000 blood donations were given per day (18, 61) . The impressive scale of the blood service in the former Soviet Union is likely to have favored HCV transmission by increasing the efficiency and geographic range of the virus's dissemination. Whether specific medical practices at this time increased the probability of mixed viral infections remains unknown. It is interesting to note that Bogdanov himself was fascinated by the ideological interpretation of blood sharing and frequently practiced what he called \"physiological collectivism\": the exchange of blood with others through mutual transfusions (61) .Although unscreened blood transfusions can provide a credible hypothesis for the origin of CRF01_1b2k in the Soviet Union some time from 1923 to 1956, we must also attempt to explain how subtype 2k or the CRF itself arrived in the Soviet Union from West Africa or the Caribbean. Migration from Africa to the former Soviet Union did occur during the late 1950s and 1970s as a result of alliances forged by the Soviet government with newly independent African states such as Ghana and Angola (35) . However, these connections are too late to have contributed to the emergence of CRF01_1b2k, according to our dating estimates. Although we cannot reject the hypothesis that the CRF was formed in West Africa and subsequently moved to the Soviet Union, our results are more consistent with the recombination event occurring in the latter. This uncertainty is likely to be reduced with further samples, especially subtype 2k viruses, from African and former Soviet Union locations.The epidemic history CRF01_1b2k (Fig. 3) since its emergence is similar to that estimated for other epidemic subtypes of HCV (e.g., see reference 33). The growth in the CRF01_1b2k effective population sizes coincides with a substantial increase in blood transfusion, including during the Second World War, and with the subsequent rise in intravenous drug usage. CRF01_1b2k transmission seems to have slowed or stabilized since the early 1990s, coinciding with the onset of the anti-HCV screening of donors. In the absence of any data to the contrary, the transmission of this recombinant and its spread from the former Soviet Union reflect the peculiar epidemiological properties of the risk groups that it has been associated with rather than any intrinsic properties of the virus.We demonstrate the practicality and benefits of using a hierarchical phylogenetic model to jointly estimate parameters of interest when analyzing multipartite sequence data that result from genetic exchange. This method yields more accurate parameter estimates than previous methods (e.g., see references 27 and 67) by incorporating the phylogenetic information and uncertainty in different genomic regions. We recommend that this improved statistical framework be used in future investigations of recombination in fast-evolving RNA viruses.This study has made significant steps in understanding the epidemic history and spread of the unique circulating HCV recombinant 2k/1b. Most significantly, we show that this strain originated many decades before the post-Soviet rise in injection behavior with which it is currently associated. On the basis of the date of its origin and its molecular epidemiology, there are reasonable grounds to suppose that the Soviet Union's revolutionary blood service was instrumental in the CRF's early generation and continental-scale spread. This infrastructure may have facilitated the pan-Eurasian spread of other parenterally transmitted bloodborne infections, and this is an interesting question for future research.", "citance": "We estimated the time of origin of CRF01_1b2k to be between 1923 and 1956, which is not much later than the origin and global spread of the parental subtype 1b (33) .", "claims": [{"text": "The origin of the CRF01_1b2k protein occurred between 1923 and 1956.

In preclinical models of breast cancer that faithfully recapitulate the disparate clinical responses in these microenvironments, we observed that brain metastases evade phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibition despite drug accumulation in the brain lesions. In comparison to extracranial disease, we observed increased HER3 expression and phosphorylation in brain lesions. HER3 blockade overcame the resistance of HER2-amplified and/or PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer brain metastases to PI3K inhibitors, resulting in marked tumor growth delay and improvement in mouse survival. These data provide a mechanistic basis for therapeutic resistance in the brain microenvironment and identify translatable treatment strategies for HER2-amplified and/or PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer brain metastases.", "citation_paragraph": "Here, we identify a mechanism by which the brain microenvironment specifically induces resistance to PI3K-targeted therapy. Our results agree with previous findings demonstrating resistance to PI3K inhibition in orthotopic PDX models of HER2-positive BC BM (34) . We believe that these findings will have a major impact on the way targeted cancer therapies are understood and applied. To date, targeted therapies mostly focus on genetically encoded vulnerabilities of cancer cells. This work demonstrates that the environment in which the cancer cells reside can also affect the efficacy of targeted therapies and that it should be considered during the development of treatment strategies.Our findings demonstrate that BC resistance to PI3K inhibition when growing in the brain is mediated by enhanced activity of the HER3 signaling pathway. The data indicate that HER3 up-regulation and activation in BM impair the ability of the PI3K inhibitor buparlisib (BKM120) to sufficiently suppress PI3K activity. Blocking HER3 or its dimerization with HER2 reduces the activity of PI3K and its downstream signaling and restores the efficacy of the PI3K inhibitor. Considering the critical role of HER3 in resistance to HER2-targeted therapies, we additionally show that HER3 targeting can overcome resistance of HER2-amplified BM to HER2-targeted therapies. Thus, the observations on the mechanistic role of HER3 activation in causing therapeutic resistance in BMs from HER2-positive BC may be applied to both PI3K-and HER2-targeted therapies. Although HER3 activation and signaling are similar between our in vitro and in vivo results, our findings do not exclude a ligand-independent role for HER3 activation in brain lesions. NRG-1 has numerous isoforms that are generated by differential promoter activity and alternative splicing, making the characterization of protein expression challenging. Splice variants with exon 7 produce a and b EGF isoforms that show both overlapping and specific biological functions. We observed expression of NRG-1 mRNA (a and b isoforms) in both the brain stroma and tumor cells. This is consistent with studies demonstrating expression of NRG-1 in BC cells (35) . Furthermore, NRG-1 is important in the regulation of brain plasticity, and it is expressed in astrocytes and neurons (36) . A recent genomic and transcriptomic investigation of BC cells from BMs revealed that tumor cells in brain lesions can lose expression of NRG-1 mRNA, suggesting that HER3-positive tumors can depend on the NRG-1-rich brain microenvironment (37) .Instead of targeting the NRG-1 ligand, we focused on targeting its receptor (HER3) because of presumed toxicities associated with depleting mice of NRG-1 (38) . This rationale is supported by preclinical findings indicating that phosphorylated HER3 is associated with resistance to inhibitors of PI3K signaling, including HER2-targeted therapies (22, 23, 39) . Moreover, clinical trials showed that targeting the HER2-HER3 interaction in patients with metastatic BC results in improved therapy response and survival (32, 40) . The treatments used in the present study may also be beneficial for metastatic BC as well as other tumor types that reside in organs that use the NRG/HER3 pathway for growth and/or survival. Previous descriptive studies reported an overexpression of HER3 in BMs, leading the authors to the conclusion that HER3 has a role in the ability of cancer cells to colonize the brain (26) . Analysis of 36 BMs from various cancers revealed that HER3 was the most highly and consistently expressed member of the ERBB/HER family across different primary cancer types and that the HER3 transcript abundance correlated with HER2 (37) . Further studies indicate that the NRG-1/HER3/ HER2 signaling activates matrix metalloproteinases to promote transendothelial migration of BC cells, suggesting that HER3 is involved in cancer cell migration through the BBB and the development of BMs (41) . Although our results do not contradict this hypothesis, the data in this study provide evidence that the expression and activation of HER3 are mediated by the CNS microenvironment. Our results obtained from multiple isogenic HER2-amplified and/or PI3KCA-mutant BC cell lines implanted in different environments reveal that HER3 is critically involved in BC BM resistance to PI3K and HER2 inhibitors, emphasizing the functional importance of the brain microenvironment in driving resistance to targeted therapies. In addition to HER3, the phosphoreceptor protein array indicated a hyperactivation of EGFR in BT474-Gluc BM. Although increased phosphorylated and total EGFR were confirmed by Western blot in BT474-Gluc BM, T47D-Gluc BM showed less phosphorylated and total EGFR compared to MFP tumors. MDA-MB-361-Gluc BM presented increased total EGFR but undetectable amounts of phosphorylated protein. Although we cannot exclude that EGFR might be involved in the resistance of HER2-amplified and/or PIK3CA-mutant BC to PI3K inhibition in the brain, the inconsistent pattern of EGFR expression and phosphorylation among the different tumors that are all resistant to buparlisib when in the brain suggests that the role of EGFR in resistance to PI3K inhibition in this setting may not be critical. Furthermore, we found that the HER2-HER3 dimerization inhibitor pertuzumab overcomes the brain microenvironment-mediated resistance to buparlisib. Pertuzumab binds the ECD II (extracellular domain II) dimerization domain of HER2 and blocks the HER2-HER3 interaction, suggesting that EGFR does not play a major role in this setting. To provide more insight, we performed in vivo studies in mice bearing HER2-amplified BT474 tumors in the brain using the dual HER2 and EGFR inhibitor neratinib. Similarly to HER2 targeting (trastuzumab) or PI3K targeting (buparlisib), neratinib monotherapy failed to delay tumor growth in the brain and improve survival. However, the addition of pertuzumab led to a marked survival improvement. Overall, these data support the hypothesis that resistance to HER2/PI3K inhibition is most likely mediated by HER2/HER3 and not by EGFR activation. Finally, the RTK screen revealed increased phosphorylation of RON RTK. RON, also known as macrophage stimulating 1 receptor, is overexpressed in BC and regulates b-catenin, NF-kB (nuclear factor kB), SMAD, and JAK/STAT3 (Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) signaling pathways (42) . Its role in HER2 signaling remains to be determined.", "citance": "Our results agree with previous findings demonstrating resistance to PI3K inhibition in orthotopic PDX models of HER2-positive BC BM (34) .", "claims": [{"text": "The orthotopic Patient-Derived Xenograft (PDX) model of HER2-positive breast cancer brain metastases (BC BM) can be treated effectively using phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors.", "subject": "phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "The orthotopic Patient-Derived Xenograft (PDX) model of HER2-positive breast cancer brain metastases (BC BM) is resistant to phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors.", "subject": "phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 8889424, "title": "A structural approach to the assessment of fracture risk in children and adolescents with chronic kidney disease", "abstract": "Children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have multiple risk factors for impaired accretion of trabecular and cortical bone. CKD during childhood poses an immediate fracture risk and compromises adult bone mass, resulting in significantly greater skeletal fragility throughout life. High-turnover disease initially results in thickened trabeculae, with greater bone volume. As disease progresses, resorption cavities dissect trabeculae, connectivity degrades, and bone volume decreases. Increased bone turnover also results in increased cortical porosity and decreased cortical thickness. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-based measures of bone mineral density (BMD) are derived from the total bone mass within the projected bone area (g/cm2), concealing distinct disease effects in trabecular and cortical bone. In contrast, peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) estimates volumetric BMD (vBMD, g/cm3), distinguishes between cortical and trabecular bone, and provides accurate estimates of cortical dimensions. Recent data have confirmed that pQCT measures of cortical vBMD and thickness provide substantially greater fracture discrimination in adult dialysis patients compared with hip or spine DXA. The following review considers the structural effects of renal osteodystrophy as it relates to fracture risk and the potential advantages and disadvantages of DXA and alternative measures of bone density, geometry, and microarchitecture, such as pQCT, micro-CT (\u03bcCT), and micro magnetic resonance imaging (\u03bcMRI) for fracture risk assessment.", "citation_paragraph": "The shape and structure of bones is continuously modified and renovated by the two processes of modeling and remodeling. Both result in the replacement of old bone with new bone. Remodeling is the major process in adults and does not result in a change of the bone shape. Remodeling takes place in the basic bone multicellular units on the trabecular surface and within the cortical bone. Normally, bone resorption by osteoclasts is followed by bone formation by osteoblasts; teams of osteoclasts and osteoblasts are juxtaposed in the bone multicellular unit, and bone resorption and formation are tightly coupled. Skeletal remodeling is vital to microdamage repair. However, after midadulthood, the amount of resorption exceeds formation, resulting in a negative bone balance.In contrast, modeling results in new bone formed at a location different from the site of bone resorption; formation and resorption are not coupled within a bone multicellular unit. Modeling results in an increase in bone diameter and modification of bone shape with linear growth. Growth in the diameter of the cortical shaft is the result of bone formation at the outer (periosteal) surface and bone resorption at the inner (endosteal) surface. Simultaneously, the growth plate moves upward and the wider metaphysis is reshaped into a diaphysis by continuous resorption by osteoclasts beneath the periosteum. The impact of CKD on bone modeling in children has not been characterized.Cortical and trabecular bone do not respond in the same way to diseases, drugs, growth factors, or sex hormones and should be considered as distinct functional entities. Trabecular vBMD, as measured by spine QCT, does not increase before puberty [28, 29] . During puberty, trabecular vBMD increases significantly due to increases in trabecular thickness. The increases in vBMD are comparable in girls and boys [30] but are significantly greater in black adolescents than in white adolescents [31] .Sex differences in cortical dimensions are established during puberty: cortical width increases by periosteal bone formation in boys and by less periosteal bone formation but more endocortical apposition in girls [32] . Androgens stimulate periosteal apposition whereas estrogens inhibit periosteal apposition and stimulate endosteal apposition. Therefore, boys have a greater cortical CSMI and stronger bones. The timing of CKD relative to pubertal maturation likely has important implications for life-long alterations in bone structure and strength.Quantitative assessment of bone status in children and adolescents DXA is widely accepted as a quantitative measurement technique for assessing skeletal status. In elderly adults, DXA BMD is a sufficiently robust predictor of osteoporotic fractures that it can be used to define the disease. The diagnosis of osteoporosis in adults is based on a T score, the comparison of a measured BMD result with the average BMD of young adults at the time of peak bone mass [33] . Clearly, it is inappropriate to compare a child's BMD with that of a young adult. Rather, children are assessed relative to age or body size, expressed as a Z score. Despite the growing body of published normative data utilizing DXA in children, there are no evidence-based guidelines for the definition of osteoporosis in children. Fractures occur commonly in otherwise healthy children, with a peak incidence during early adolescence around the time of the pubertal growth spurt [34] . Several studies have compared the DXA BMD of normal children and adolescents with forearm fractures to that of age-matched controls without fractures. Most [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] , but not all [40, 41] , found that mean DXA BMD was significantly lower in children with forearm fractures than in controls.A significant limitation of DXA is the reliance on measurement of areal rather than volumetric BMD. DXA provides an estimate of BMD expressed as grams per anatomical region (e.g. individual vertebrae, whole body, or hip). Dividing the BMC within the defined anatomical region (g) by the projected area of the bone (cm 2 ) then derives \"areal BMD\" (g/cm 2 ). This BMD is not a measure of vBMD (g/cm 3 ) because it provides no information about the depth of bone. Bones of larger width and height also tend to be thicker. As bone thickness is not factored into DXA estimates of areal BMD, reliance on DXA inherently underestimates the bone density of short people. Despite identical vBMD, the child with smaller bones appears to have a mineralization disorder (decreased areal BMD) [42] . This is clearly an important artifact in children with chronic diseases, such as CKD, that are associated with poor growth. For this reason, many investigators advocate that areal BMD should not be used in growing children [43] [44] [45] .", "citance": "Fractures occur commonly in otherwise healthy children, with a peak incidence during early adolescence around the time of the pubertal growth spurt [34] .", "claims": [{"text": "The peak incidence of fractures occurs during pubertal growth spurt in early adolescents.", "subject": "peak incidence of fractures ", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "The peak incidence of fractures occurs in toddlers.", "subject": "peak incidence of fractures ", "is_negation": true}]}
{"s2orc_id": 201716772, "title": "Linc00173 promotes chemoresistance and progression of small cell lung cancer by sponging miR-218 to regulate Etk expression", "abstract": "The functional effects of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cancer have been widely recognized. However, there is little research on SCLC-related lncRNAs. Here, long intergenic nonprotein coding RNA 173 (Linc00173) was first shown to be involved in chemoresistance and progression of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). We found that Linc00173 was highly expressed in SCLC chemoresistant cell lines, and promoted SCLC cells chemoresistance, proliferation, and migration-invasion. Animal studies validated that Linc00173 induced tumor chemoresistance and growth of SCLC in vivo. Moreover, Linc00173 upregulated Etk through functioning as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) by \u201csponging\u201d miRNA-218 and led to the upregulation of GSKIP and NDRG1, resulting in the translocation of \u03b2-catenin. Importantly, expression analysis revealed that both Linc00173 and Etk were upregulated in SCLC patient samples and exhibiting positive Linc00173/Etk correlation. High expression of Linc00173 closely correlated with chemoresistance, extensive stage, and shorter survival in SCLC patients. Collectively, our study illustrated a Linc00173-mediated process that facilitated chemoresistance and progression in SCLC, which might provide treatment strategy against SCLC.", "citation_paragraph": "Previous studies have shown that Linc00173 is involved in renewal of the intestinal mucosa, granulocytic differentiation, and regulating cell proliferation and the cell cycle of ESCC cells [10] [11] [12] . In this study, we first identified Linc00173 was SCLC associated. Linc00173 was significantly upregulated in SCLC chemoresistant cells and tissues. High expression of Linc00173 was correlated with extensive stage, drug resistance, and poor prognosis of SCLC. Functional investigations revealed the tumorigenic roles of Linc00173 in promoting cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion and enhancing drug resistance. These findings demonstrate that Linc00173 is involved in SCLC chemoresistance and has an oncogenic role in SCLC tumorigenesis.A growing number of reports provide support for the ceRNA hypothesis, which proposes that transcripts with shared miRNA binding sites compete for posttranscriptional control [23, 24] . To investigate whether Linc00173 can act as a ceRNA in SCLC chemoresistance, we performed a bioinformatic analysis to identify its potential interactions with miRNAs. As expected, hsa-miR-218 was predicted to show complementary base pairing with Linc00173 and Etk, which has been found relating to SCLC chemoresistance [16] . Moreover, FISH assay showed that Linc00173 was localized both in nucleus and cytoplasm and had more accumulation in some part of nucleus. We also detected the expression of Linc00173 expression in cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA fractions from SCLC cells by qRT-PCR, which showed that Linc00173 and miR-218 mostly expressed in the cell nucleus, but could also express in cytoplasm. A previous report revealed the predominant localization of Linc00173 in mononuclear macrophage nuclei [11] , which is consistent with the localization of Linc00173 in SCLC cell lines in our study. Although many articles suggest that the ceRNA mechanism usually occurs in the cytoplasm, which is consistent with the canonical view that miRNAs act in the cytoplasm [25] , there are still many evidences that miRNAs could interact with other noncoding RNAs or protein-coding mRNAs in the nucleus [26] [27] [28] . For example, ncRNA HSURs interacts with predicted miRNAs in T cell nuclei [29] , and miR-671 interacts with both CDR1 noncoding antisense RNA and sense CDR1 in HEK293 cell nuclei, which proposed the sponge model hypothesis that the abundance of CDR1 NAS antisense may titrate an miRNA from acting on the CDR1 mRNA then stabilizes sense CDR1 mRNA [30] . Mature miRNAs usually interact with RNAs by binding with Ago2 proteins to form a RISC, which can be imported into the nucleus via carrier factors [28] . Although no literatures have clearly demonstrated the ceRNA mechanism that occurs in the nucleus, abundant studies have indicated that miRNA can interact with either ncRNA or mRNA in the nucleus. The ceRNA hypothesis relies on that the miRNAs can interact with the transcriptome including the protein-coding genes or ncRNA, so it is reasonable to assume that ceRNA mechanism may occur in cytoplasm as well as in nucleus. Although the predominant nuclear localization of Linc00173 is noncanonical for ceRNAs, the results of our study indicate that Linc00173 may serve as a sponge both in nucleus and cytoplasm in SCLC. First, we found that Linc00173, whose abundance was markedly higher than that of miR-218 in SCLC tissues, was inversely correlated with miR-218 expression. Second, we revealed an endogenous interaction between miR-218 containing RISC and Linc00173 or Etk by luciferase assays, RNA immunoprecipitation with the Ago2 protein, Linc00173, or miR-218 pull-down assays, and FISH assays. Third, Linc00173 abolished the miR-218-mediated biological effects. Lastly, Linc00173 regulated the expression of the miR-218 target gene Etk. Together, these data strongly supported the role of Linc00173 as a ceRNA for miR-218.Etk has been demonstrated to be involved in chemoresistance by mediating Bcl-X L and inhibiting apoptosis via Bcl-2 or regulating autophagy of SCLC in our previous studies [14] [15] [16] . In our in vitro and in vivo systems, the ectopic expression of Linc00173 was sufficient to increase the expression of Etk. Moreover, we demonstrated that Linc00173 expression positively correlated with Etk expression in SCLC tissues and peripheral blood samples. In addition, Linc00173 knockdown significantly arrested chemoresistance, cell proliferation, migration, and invasion induced by Etk Fig. 7 Upregulation of NDRG1 and GSKIP by Etk promotes \u03b2-catenin nuclear accumulation in SCLC cells. a NDRG1 and GSKIP mRNA levels in SCLC cells following overexpression of Etk or knockdown of Etk were evaluated by qRT-PCR. b NDRG1 and GSKIP protein levels in SCLC cells following overexpression of Etk or knockdown of Etk were evaluated by Western blot analysis. c NDRG1 and GSKIP protein levels in (left) H446 cells transfected with miR-218 inhibitor and siRNA targeting Etk or Linc00173, (right) in H446DDP transfected with miR-218 mimics and Etk or Linc00173-overexpressing plasmid or the negative control vector. d Etk, NDRG1 and GSKIP levels in Linc00173-downregulated or overexpression tumors were detected by immunohistochemical staining (left). The IOD/area of Etk, NDRG1, and GSKIP positivity in images was analyzed with Image-Pro Plus analysis software (right). e The changes in protein levels in the nucleus or cytoplasm of \u03b2-catenin caused by Etk or Linc00173 or miR-218 upor downregulation were detected by Western blotting. GAPDH and LaminB1 were used as loading controls. f The change in \u03b2-catenin cellular localizations caused by Etk or Linc00173 upregulation or miR-218 downregulation was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining of H446 cells. Error bars, mean \u00b1 SD from three independent experiments. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01. Scale bars, 200 \u03bcm overexpression. Taken together, our data demonstrated that Linc00173 functioned as a ceRNA to regulate Etk expression in SCLC chemoresistance improvement.To further understand the biological function of Etk in SCLC chemoresistance, we performed a microarray analysis to screen molecules downstream of Etk and discovered NDRG1 and GSKIP. NDRG1 is an oncogenic gene in different cancers [19, 20] . NDRG1 could competitively bind to GSK-3\u03b2 and Nur77 to allow \u03b2-catenin to escape degradation and translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus [19] . GSKIP was shown to be associated with tumorigenesis and chemoresistance of hepatocellular carcinoma [17] . Studies demonstrated that GSKIP could enhance Wnt-induced signaling by negatively regulating GSK3\u03b2, leading to \u03b2-catenin stabilization and nuclear accumulation [17, 18, 21] . The nuclear accumulation of \u03b2-catenin could activate the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, which is closely correlated with the proliferation, invasion, migration and chemoresistance of various cancers [31, 32] . Our results suggested that Etk and Linc00173 could facilitate \u03b2-catenin translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus by upregulating NDRG1 and GSKIP while miR-218 led to the opposite effect. Linc00173 could also promote NDRG1 and GSKIP expression in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, Linc00173 may facilitate chemoresistance and progression of SCLC by targeting Etk, which could regulate NDRG1, GSKIP and activate \u03b2-catenin signaling (Fig. 8) .In summary, we revealed that Linc00173 promoted SCLC chemoresistance, proliferation, and migrationinvasion by acting as a ceRNA for miR-218, resulting in upregulation of Etk. In addition, the Linc00173-miR-218-Etk axis resulted in nuclear accumulation of \u03b2-catenin by increasing NDRG1 and GSKIP expression. The present study may help elucidate the function of the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA network in SCLC development, and Linc00173 may be a potentially useful target for SCLC diagnosis and therapies.", "citance": "A previous report revealed the predominant localization of Linc00173 in mononuclear macrophage nuclei [11] , which is consistent with the localization of Linc00173 in SCLC cell lines in our study.", "claims": [{"text": "The predominant localization of Linc00173 is in mononuclear macrophage nuclei.

The cerebral cortex is arranged into layers of specialized neuron subtypes formed during development by orchestrated stem cell maintenance, expansion, fate commitment and differentiation. The cortical neural stem cells generate billions of neurons in a systematic fashion. The mechanisms and their interplay that control most aspects of human brain development are unclear. This is partially due to the ethical and practical challenges associated with analyzing fetal human development. Recent progress into understanding the formation of the human brain has taken advantage of in vitro modeling of corticogenesis using pluripotent cells. Human pluripotent stem cells and procedures developed for their differentiation provided previously unavailable opportunities to study the mechanisms involved in development of the cerebral cortex. These human cell culture models can be applied to address specific biological questions and have been successfully utilized to investigate mechanisms associated, not only with normal brain development, but also neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we review the recent literature that uses these cell culture models to study human corticogenesis. Then, we discuss the challenges and limitations of the current models.", "citation_paragraph": "Pluripotent Stem Cell Based Cultures to Study Key Aspects of Human Cerebral Cortex Development differentiation of human cortical neurons is protracted compared to mouse. Although this could have been expected, as during murine embryogenesis cortical neurons are generated over a 6-day period, in humans the process takes more than 100 days (GW5-30) [12, 30] . The fact that similar species-specific time scales are maintained in vitro suggests some form of inherent or self-regulatory mechanism exists that \"times\" neurogenesis. Comparison of adherent and organoid cultures from mouse, human and other primates revealed that the proliferative capacity of progenitors is regulated cell-autonomously and differs across species [68] . This is not due to aberrant progenitor cell specification in vitro as outer radial glial (ORG) cells derived from human pluripotent stem cells have similar molecular characteristics to ORG cells isolated from human fetal brains [69] . In addition, the ORG cells in the OSV-like region of organoids expressed the prominent markers of ORG including HOPX, FAM107A, and PTPRZ1 [53, 65] . Moreover, none of the current cerebral organoid models recapitulated folding and gyrification of human brain. Recently, deletion of PTEN, an anti-proliferative protein, induced neural progenitor proliferation, which led to larger and partially folded human cerebral organoids. However, in contrast, deletion of PTEN from mouse cerebral organoids did not induce folding demonstrating species-specific regulatory mechanism that is conserved and active in vitro [70] .The fact that human cortical neurogenesis in vitro is very protracted presents challenges for analysis of gene function and drug screening. Hence, accelerated differentiation protocols are being developed by combining different combinations and temporal regimes of small molecules, to produced cortical neurons from pluripotent stem cells in a precise and prompt way [71] . The simultaneous inhibition of progenitor maintenance and targeted differentiation with small molecules, reduces the differentiation time to generate, for example, functional deep layer (layer VI) neurons [71] .Another approach that is being explored to circumvent the time problem is directed differentiation using transcription factormediated differentiation [72, 73] . Direct programing of pluripotent or even somatic cells to specific neuronal subtypes is an attractive prospect to generate homogeneous neuron populations. For example, conversion of somatic cells (fibroblast) to neurons by expression the transcription factors Ascl1, Brn2 (Pou3f2) and Myt1l [74] . In this case, the procedure bypasses expansion of the pluripotent state and directly induces neurons.Interestingly, somatic cell aging hallmarks are maintained in neurons derived by direct programing, while many of the age associated epigenetic marks are reset in neurons differentiated from iPSCs and, therefore, they do not retain age-associated characteristics [75, 76] . Importantly, the current cultures give-rise to relatively immature neurons that are at an early to mid-stage of cortical development [53, 61, 77] .Comparison of gene expression profiles of human fetal brain confirmed that organoid-derived cells resemble the early stages of brain development [51] . In the future, it will be important to model neurons of late stages of development or even the adult brain. Towards this goal, induced aging of neurons derived from iPSCs has been attempted by expressing Progerin [78] or by inducing the cells with cellular stressors [6, 79] . Modeling of aging in culture still remains to be a major challenge and it will be interesting to study the disease associated mechanisms in an aged brain model in the future [6] .", "citance": "Comparison of adherent and organoid cultures from mouse, human and other primates revealed that the proliferative capacity of progenitors is regulated cell-autonomously and differs across species [68] .", "claims": [{"text": "The proliferative capacity of progenitors is regulated cell-autonomously.", "subject": "proliferative capacity", "is_negation": false}]}

Histone acetylation can potentially open up chromatin by neutralizing the positive charge of histone lysine residues. Consistent with this function, histone acetylation is highly enriched in ESCs compared with differentiated cells [19, 20, 25, 26] , indicating that it contributes to the open chromatin state in ESCs. Consistently, treatments of HDAC inhibitors have been shown to enhance nuclear dynamics, reduce differentiation propensity [46] and support the selfrenewal program in ESCs [47] . In addition, in cell fusion-mediated reprogramming, low levels of histone H3 K9 acetylation (H3K9ac) in ESCs correlate with reduced efficiency in reprogramming the nuclei from fibroblasts, and HDAC inhibitors can improve the reprogramming efficiency [48] . In support of the role of histone acetylation in reprograming, HDAC inhibitors, including valproic acid (VPA) and butyrate, significantly improve the efficiency of iPSC generation [49] [50] [51] [52] . Butyrate also promotes the reprogramming fidelity by reducing the frequency of partially reprogrammed cells [52] . Treatments of the reprogramming cells with HDAC inhibitors lead to enhanced expression of ESC-enriched genes before the establishment of pluripotency [49, 51, 52] . Furthermore, the role of VPA in reprogramming can be at least partly attributed to its ability to induce HDAC2 degradation [53] . It has been reported that VPA treatment or HDAC2 depletion allows reprogramming by the microRNA cluster miR302/367 without introducing any other factors [53] . Finally, HDAC inhibitors have also been applied to rectify aberrantly silenced loci and eliminate the somatic cell memory in established iPSC lines [54, 55] .Despite the prevailing evidence for the association between histone acetylation and pluripotency, it is surprising that few reports have identified the function of individual HATs or HDACs in regulating pluripotency. A recent study showed that, Kat8 (also called Mof or Myst1), a HAT catalyzing H4K16ac, is important for ESC identity [25] . Kat8 deletion abolishes the self-renewal capacity and pluripotency of ESCs. Mechanistically, Kat8 has been found to regulate the ESC transcription network by functioning upstream to activate Nanog [25] . Interestingly, Wdr5, a shared component of the Kat8-containing complex and the MLL complex catalyzing H3K4 methylation [56] , displays a phenotype similar to that of Kat8 when depleted in ESCs [57] . Given that Dpy30, another MLL complex component regulating H3K4 methylation, is dispensable for ESC self-renewal [58] , it seems likely that the Kat8-containing complex mediates the Wdr5 function. In support of this notion, the recruitment of Wdr5 to its target loci, including key pluripotency genes, depends on Kat8 [25] . The fact that the binding of Wdr5 to these loci results in an enrichment of H3K4me3 indicates a hierarchical relationship between these histone modifications [25] . Wdr5 has been shown to be required for efficient generation of iPSCs [57] . It will be interesting to investigate the potential effect of Kat8 on iPSC generation. Kat8 may enhance the reprogramming efficiency by directly activating Nanog and promote the conversion of pre-iPSCs to iPSCs.", "citance": "In support of this notion, the recruitment of Wdr5 to its target loci, including key pluripotency genes, depends on Kat8 [25] .", "claims": [{"text": "The recruitment of Wdr5 to its target loci depends on Kat8.

The ability to target a Cas nuclease to DNA sequences with a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) has provided a dynamic tool for genome editing and is naturally derived from an adaptive immune system in bacteria and archaea. CRISPR/Cas systems are being rapidly improved and refined, thereby opening up even more possibilities. Classical plant breeding is based on genetic variations that occur naturally and is used to select plants with improved traits. Induced mutagenesis is used to enhance mutational frequency and accelerate this process. Plants have evolved cellular processes, including certain repair mechanisms that ensure DNA integrity and the maintenance of distinct DNA loci. The focus of this review is on the characterization of new potentials in plant breeding through the use of CRISPR/Cas systems that eliminate natural limitations in order to induce thus far unachievable genomic changes.", "citation_paragraph": "Naturally occurring mutations are unpredictable changes in DNA caused due to errors in replication or through environmental factors such as sunlight. In spontaneous mutations, the source of the mutation is either not predictable or unknown. Thus, determining the specific cause of a spontaneous, natural mutation, either through DNA replication or through environmental factors, is not possible. Induced mutations are caused by exposure to physical or chemical agents, for example, as applied in mutagenesis breeding or in basic research. For many decades, plant breeders have used chemical mutagens or irradiation to increase the frequency of the formation of mutations in seeds or other parts of plants (Tadele, 2016) . The concentration of the mutagen, the length of treatment, and the temperature at which the experiment is carried out affect the efficiency of mutagenesis. The concentration of the mutagen that results in the best mutational frequency with the least possible unintended damage is considered the optimal Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.orgdose for induced mutagenesis (Mba et al., 2010) . The most commonly used chemical substance in plant breeding is ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS; Sikora et al., 2011) . EMS selectively alkylates guanine bases forming O6-ethylguanine, which base pairs with thymine, causing a base mispairing. It has been shown that the treatment of the cells with EMS primarily induces point mutations in the genome with a bias for G/C to A/T mutations in many plants (Greene et al., 2003; Till et al., 2004 Till et al., , 2007 . Beside its function in repairing replication errors, the MMR system also recognizes and repairs sites of alkylation damage (Wang and Edelmann, 2006) . Depending on the doses of EMS, the sites of damage can be larger than the number of available components of the MMR and some damage might remain unrepaired. The induced mutations might also be repaired at different rates depending on their local environment (Marsischky and Kolodner, 1999; Greene et al., 2003) . Overall, EMS treatment leads to an increased mutational frequency that enhances genetic variation. Mutagenized plants are screened phenotypically as either a forward genetic approach or point mutations can be identified using a reverse genetic strategy that is known as Targeting Induced Local Lesions In Genomes (TILLING; McCallum et al., 2000) . After treatment with the mutagenic agents, the seeds are planted and allowed to self-fertilize to produce a T2 generation. DNA from T2 plants is isolated and screened for desired mutations (Sikora et al., 2011) . Ordinarily, TILLING uses a mismatch-specific endonuclease to identify induced point mutations in populations of mutagenized individuals (Colbert et al., 2001) . Next-generation sequencing is gradually replacing classical TILLING for mutation screening as it is a faster and more efficient approach (Gupta et al., 2017) . After the identification of a plant carrying a beneficial mutation, undesired changes of the DNA are outcrossed (Kurowska et al., 2011) . This high-throughput screening for induced point mutations is a very efficient and fast approach to identify mutations in a gene of interest. EMS-saturated mutagenesis screens combine EMS treatment with TILLING and are being used to identify all genes that are involved in certain biological processes. EMS-saturated mutagenesis screens were applied, for example, in Arabidopsis thaliana to identify mutations that result in herbicide-resistant plants (Jander et al., 2003) . Induced mutagenesis by EMS treatment results in a specific mutational pattern, but the parts of the genome where these mutations occur and if they are repairable by cellular repair mechanisms are not predictable. On the other hand, CRISPR/Cas9 enables in a site-directed process precise changes of the genome at targeted sites. Recently, it was shown that in human cells, Cas9-induced DSBs tend to be predominantly repaired in an error-prone way, leading to the introduction of genomic alterations rather than recovering the original DNA sequence (Brinkman et al., 2018) . Their results indicate that the error rate of the repair of Cas9-induced DSBs is locus dependent. The estimated error rates of 20-100% per break event induced by Cas9 appear rather high, suggesting that the repair of Cas9-induced DSBs is not representative for the repair of naturally occurring DSBs (Brinkman et al., 2018) . The enhanced repair error rates of Cas9-induced DSBs and the targeting of Cas9 to any specific target regions increase the likelihood of mediating an alteration of the DNA sequence enormously, even in naturally rather less accessible parts of the genome.", "citance": "Recently, it was shown that in human cells, Cas9-induced DSBs tend to be predominantly repaired in an error-prone way, leading to the introduction of genomic alterations rather than recovering the original DNA sequence (Brinkman et al., 2018) .", "claims": [{"text": "The repair of Cas9-induced double strand breaks in human DNA is error-prone.", "subject": "Repair of Cas9-induced double strand breaks", "is_negation": false}]}

However, the off-target effects of TAL have severely hindered the development of this promising technology. To better exploit the specific interaction and to deeper understand the TAL-induced host transcription rewiring, the binding between the central repeat region (CRR) of the TAL effector AvrXa27 and its UPT box variants was studied by kinetics analysis and TAL-blocked helicase unwinding assay. The results revealed that while AvrXa27 exhibited the highest affinity to the wild type UPT box, it could also bind to mutated UPT box variants, implying the possibility of non-specific interactions. Furthermore, some of these non-specific combinations restricted the helicase-elicited double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) separation to a greater extent. Our findings provide insight into the mechanism of TAL transcriptional activation and are beneficial to TAL-mediated genome modification.", "citation_paragraph": "Pathogen derived Transcription-Activator Like (TAL) effectors alter host plant target gene expression by imitating eukaryotic transcription factors [1e5] . TAL effectors share a highly conserved structure, containing an N-terminal Type III secretion signal, a central repeat region (CRR), C-terminal nuclear localization signals, and a transcriptional activation domain [6] . CRR consists of repeats with similar amino acid sequences. Crystal structure studies show that each repeat forms a helix-loop-helix motif, and several repeats fold into a right-handed superhelix wrapping around the target promoter element. The repeat-variable diresidue (RVD) in the loop specifies the nucleotides-amino acid contact [7, 8] . A series of results from GUS reporter gene assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays have been statistically analyzed to decipher the code for recognition between the RVDs and their target DNA nucleotides. Some RVDs are found to interact preferably with a particular nucleotide, while others can bind to multiple nucleotides but with different frequencies [9e14] .The unique nucleotide binding property of TAL effectors has been widely used in customizing proteins for DNA editing (including cleavage, modification and mutation of target gene), manipulation of gene transcription, and creation of broadspectrum disease resistance crops [4,15e19] . However, some offtarget issues have been reported when using this TAL-DNA binding model [20e24] , which severely hinders the application of this promising technology.Recent studies resorted to detecting the specificity of the TAL and UPT box interaction by measuring binding affinity. Meckleret al. [25] revealed that different RVDs contributed to TAL-DNA binding affinities in various orders. In another case, excessive DNA binding affinity was found to cause reduced TALEN specificity [26] . Moreover, a study concerning a Zinc-finger protein demonstrated that for a particular DNA site, the protein with the highest affinity did not show the highest specificity [27] .

Here, we uncover mechanisms underlying the dynamic regulation of these ring complexes (RCs), revealing a strategy by which protein complexes can be progressively remodeled during cellular processes. We find that the assembly, maintenance, and stability of RCs is regulated by a balance between SUMO conjugating and deconjugating activity. During prometaphase, the SUMO protease ULP-1 is targeted to the RCs but is counteracted by SUMO E2/E3 enzymes; then in early anaphase the E2/E3 enzymes are removed, enabling ULP-1 to trigger RC disassembly and completion of the meiotic divisions. Moreover, we found that SUMO regulation is essential to properly connect the RCs to the chromosomes and then also to fully release them in anaphase. Altogether, our work demonstrates that dynamic remodeling of SUMO modifications facilitates key meiotic events and highlights how competition between conjugation and deconjugation activity can modulate SUMO homeostasis, protein complex stability, and ultimately, progressive processes such as cell division.", "citation_paragraph": "In recent years, it has become apparent that SUMO plays an important role in the regulation of meiotic and mitotic progression, as many SUMOylated cell division proteins have been identified, SUMO localizes to the spindle in many organisms, and disruption in global SUMOylation and/or specific SUMOylated substrates generally results in severe spindle and/ or chromosome segregation defects [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . Given its reversible nature, SUMOylation is now appreciated as a useful post-translational modification for regulating protein localization and function during dynamic cellular processes such as cell division. Our study reinforces and expands upon this view, demonstrating a new role for SUMO in regulating anaphase progression in C. elegans oocytes by mediating the assembly and disassembly of an important protein complex. Moreover, our work reveals novel insight into the complexity of how SUMO/SIM networks can be regulated and remodeled, by targeting both SUMO E2/E3 enzymes and SUMO proteases to the protein complex to achieve fine-tuning and rapid changes in protein interactions.In addition to further examining how competition between conjugating and deconjugating enzymes regulates the overall SUMOylation state of the RC, it will be interesting to investigate how these enzymes achieve substrate specificity. Since the RC appears to be built in discrete layers [2] , one possibility is that access to substrates plays a key role in regulating substrate specificity. Additionally, phosphorylation states likely have a role in influencing protein targets, with the modification occurring on the enzyme itself and/or on the substrate RC proteins. , microtubules (green), the fully-assembled RCs with AIR-2 (orange), AIR-2 (yellow), and the disassembling RCs without AIR-2 (red). In normal oocyte meiosis (left column), the RCs are SUMOylated and the SUMO protease ULP-1 is targeted to the RCs by BUB-1. During anaphase, SUMO E2/E3 enzymes leave the RCs, allowing ULP-1 to remove SUMO modifications that trigger RC disassembly. When this happens, AIR-2 leaves the RCs and relocalizes to the microtubules and the RCs break down. Under experimental conditions in which ULP-1 cannot localize to the RC, such as ULP-1 or BUB-1 depletion (middle column), the RCs remain in a SUMOylated state that prevents RC disassembly and AIR-2 relocalization and impedes completion of the meiotic divisions. In an error-response (right column), the oocyte retains the E2/E3 enzymes to delay RC disassembly and AIR-2 relocalization. Eventually though, RC disassembly proceeds and cytokinesis occurs. (B) ULP-1 (SUMO protease, magenta), UBC-9 (SUMO E2, blue), and GEI-17 (SUMO E3, blue) are on the RCs in metaphase where they compete for substrate. During early anaphase UBC-9 (E2) and GEI-17 (E3) leave the structures and ULP-1 deSUMOylation activity promotes RC disassembly. By mid anaphase, the RCs are breaking down (not shown in cartoon) and ULP-1 is absent from the complexes.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007626.g008Supporting this idea, 1) there are kinases in the RC (AIR-2, BUB-1) and 2) the phosphorylation state of many cell division proteins changes during the transition from metaphase to anaphase. Finally, many SUMO proteases have preferences for either mono-SUMOylation or various SUMO chain lengths, and this preference could act as another mode of regulation. In the future, it will be important to understand how SUMO E2/E3 enzymes and proteases act on specific substrates in order to facilitate changes in protein-protein interactions. Our study establishes the RC as an ideal model for addressing these questions, as it represents a protein complex whose progressive remodeling is regulated by a balance of SUMOylation and deSUMOylation activity. Future studies expanding upon this work will therefore not only uncover mechanisms acting to ensure the faithful segregation of chromosomes during oocyte meiosis but will also shed light on principles underlying the regulation of SUMO during dynamic cellular processes.", "citance": "Since the RC appears to be built in discrete layers [2] , one possibility is that access to substrates plays a key role in regulating substrate specificity.", "claims": [{"text": "The ring complexes of chromosomes in C. elegans oocytes are built in discrete layers.

{"s2orc_id": 7638458, "title": "Risk of breast cancer among daughters of mothers with diabetes: a population-based cohort study", "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Diabetes during pregnancy is related to enhanced fetal growth, which has been associated with increased breast cancer risk. Whether daughters of mothers with a diagnosis of diabetes have an increased risk of breast cancer is not known.   METHODS We performed a retrospective cohort study of daughters of mothers with diabetes by linkage of the Swedish Multigeneration, Cause-of-Death and Patient Register between 1952 and 2005. Breast cancer cases were ascertained by linkage with the Swedish Cancer Register between 1958 and 2005. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of breast cancer were calculated assuming a Poisson distribution for the observed cases.   RESULTS We identified 291,360 daughters of mothers with a diagnosis of diabetes before or after birth between 1952 and 2005. Among the daughters, 7,956 cases of breast cancer were diagnosed between 1964 and 2005. The total time of follow-up was 12,173,821 person years. The expected number of breast cancer cases was 9,204, resulting in an SIR of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.85 to 0.88). The decrease in risk associated with maternal diabetes was stronger for premenopausal (< 55 years of age) than postmenopausal (> or = 55 years of age) breast cancer (SIR 0.83 and 0.91, respectively). Among daughters of mothers with diabetes, a history of breast cancer in the mother increased the risk of breast cancer in the daughter (SIR 1.43, 1.32 to 1.54).   CONCLUSIONS Daughters of mothers with a lifetime history of diabetes were at a decreased risk of breast cancer. The strongest negative association was found among premenopausal breast cancer.", "citation_paragraph": "In this retrospective cohort study on close to 8,000 breast cancer cases we observed a significantly decreased risk of breast cancer among daughters of mothers with a lifetime history of diabetes. The strongest negative association was found for premenopausal breast cancer, with a 17% reduction in risk. Hence the findings from our study are in contradiction to our hypothesis of an elevated risk of breast cancer among daughters of mothers with diabetes.Previous studies have found that increased fetal growth measured by birth weight and height is positively associated with breast cancer risk. In a meta-analysis including studies published between 1980 and 2007, Xue et al. report a small but significant 15% increased risk of breast cancer for increased birthweight and an almost 30% risk increase for high birth length [8] . The associations appeared to be stronger for premenopausal than postmenopausal breast cancer. There was no association between gestational age at birth and subsequent breast cancer risk [8] .We did not have information on gestational age and birth weight of the daughters in the study, and therefore we could not explore whether the inverse association between mater- nal diabetes and breast cancer risk among the daughters was influenced by these perinatal factors. Another limitation of the study is that we were not able to distinguish between type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes among mothers. Type 2 diabetes is by far the most common diabetes type, and the underlying biologic mechanisms affecting maternal glucose metabolism are similar for all types of diabetes. We were able to identify diabetes in the mother starting in 1965. Hence, diagnosis of diabetes in the mothers could be after the birth of the daughters being followed for breast cancer. We do not know whether the mother had previously been diagnosed with diabetes, in particular, prior to her pregnancy with the daughter, or whether the hospitalization was related to newly diagnosed diabetes; it is possible that the mother developed diabetes after the index daughter was born. Since diabetes develops over a considerable time period, however, the mother is likely to have been affected by insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia much earlier and thus also during her pregnancy with the daughter [9] . Fetal weight is strongly correlated with maternal weight in early pregnancy and weight gain during pregnancy [10] . Overweight and obese mothers are more likely to give birth to infants with a high birth weight as well as large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infants [10] . Overweight and obesity are also closely linked to gestational diabetes and type 2 diabetes later in life [6] . We postulated that diabetes would increase the risk of breast cancer among the offspring. Besides gestational and type 2 diabetes, overweight and obesity are also closely linked to development of preeclampsia [11] , and the risk increases in a dose-dependent manner with increasing maternal body mass index (BMI) ( [12] . Intrauterine exposure to preeclampsia has been associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer among the offspring [13, 14] . Preeclampsia is linked to placental dysfunction and, as a consequence, fetal growth restriction. The placenta is the primary source of pregnancy hormones, and placental impairment may serve as an indirect marker for placental function during pregnancy. In a study by Cohn et al., markers for placental dysfunction such as low placental weight, small diameter, and presence of infarctions reduced the rate of breast cancer of the mother not explained by preeclampsia or other known breast cancer risk factors [15] . Reduced levels of estrogen by a decreased synthesis of the smaller placenta as well as increased andro- gen levels due to the inverse relation between placental size and androgen level may explain the reduction in breast cancer risk among women with preeclampsia [15] . Among parous women, the risk of breast cancer increases by placental weight of the pregnancies, and the association is strongest for premenopausal breast cancer [16] . Unfortunately, neither data on birth weight or placental weight nor on preeclampsia were available for the population in the current study. Previous studies suggest a modest increase in risk of breast cancer among women with type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes [5] . In the present study we did not have information on diabetes among the daughters and consequently we could not study its possible influence on breast cancer. We observed that diabetes in the mother had a stronger inverse association with premenopausal than postmenopausal breast cancer. Overweight and obese women have a higher incidence of postmenopausal breast cancer, whereas an inverse association has been consistently observed between BMI and premenopausal breast cancer [17] . In a large prospective Nordic study by Weiderpass et al. [18] , a decreased risk of breast cancer was observed among overweight and obese women. Similar findings have been reported in a US study based on the Nurses' Health Study II [19] . The biological rationale for this decreased risk among overweight and obese women has been attributed to an increased proportion of anovulatory menstrual cycles resulting in decreased estradiol and progesterone levels [20] . However, this mechanism was not supported in the above mentioned studies [18, 19] . Apart from reduced estrogen levels [21] , an increased concentration of androgens and low levels of SHBG have been suggested as the biological rationale for the association between obesity and reduced breast cancer risk among premenopausal women. However, a study based on the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) reported increased risk of premenopausal breast cancer with high levels of testosterone and androstenedione [22] .Breast cancer incidence is higher in women with high socioeconomic status. In a recent UK study, the relative risk of breast cancer among the most deprived women was 16 percent lower than in the least deprived [23] . Affluent women are more likely to have their first child at a later age, have fewer children in their lifetime, and have an increased use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), factors that have been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Deprived women are more likely not to attend breast cancer screening programs, which may delay cancer diagnosis [24] . However, we observed that the lowest risk of breast cancer was found prior to 1980, before the breast screening program became nationwide in Sweden. Women with low socioeconomic status have higher prevalence of overweight and obesity, which are strongly related to the development of type 2 diabetes [25] . Hence, our find- ings of a decreased risk of breast cancer among daughters of mothers with diabetes may also be due to confounding by socioeconomic status and for age at first birth, since we were not able to adjust for these characteristics. By comparing breast cancer incidence in daughters of mothers with diabetes to the general population, we probably underestimate the true association because diabetes often goes undiagnosed for several years. The prevalence of diabetes in Sweden has not increased between 1986 and 1999, and would therefore not influence the results [26] . Only few cohorts worldwide allow the study of prenatal exposures and cancer risk in adult life. This is the most likely reason why the association between maternal diabetes and breast cancer has not been studied to date. The major strengths of the present study include populationbased data with almost complete information on breast cancer diagnosis ascertainment and the register linkage preventing recall or reporting bias and selection bias. It is likely that we have captured the most severe cases of diabetes in the cohort; however, this may only strengthen the results, as any association will most likely be identified. Since our comparison is made with an expected number of breast cancer cases in an age-standardized population in Sweden, any misclassification due to diabetes not detected will not introduce any bias. To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has considered the possible association between maternal diabetes and subsequent breast cancer risk in the daughter. Further studies accounting for maternal as well as fetal weight, preeclampsia, and age at first birth are warranted to verify these novel findings.", "citance": "Among parous women, the risk of breast cancer increases by placental weight of the pregnancies, and the association is strongest for premenopausal breast cancer [16] .", "claims": [{"text": "The risk of breast cancer among parous women decreases with placental weight of pregnancies.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "The risk of breast cancer among parous women increases with placental weight of pregnancies, and this association is strongest for premenopausal breast cancer.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

The purpose of this study was to assess female prisoners' health status and access to healthcare in the Attica detention center \"Korydallos\".   METHODS A cross-sectional survey was carried out in 2014. A semi-structured questionnaire was developed, including questions on the prisoners' socio-demographic characteristics, self-reported health status before and after incarceration, access to and quality of the provided health services. Inmates who were in solitary confinement, suffered from serious psychiatric problems, or were unable to understand the Greek language were excluded from the study. Data were collected via personal interviews and information received was anonymized. Descriptive statistics and bivariate analyses were used. The difference between self-reported general health status prior to and during detention was analyzed by Wilcoxon test, while the relationship between health status and access to healthcare was explored with coefficient Spearman's rho. Statistical significance was set at p \u2264 0.05 level and statistical analysis was performed using the software SPSS 19.   RESULTS Of the 135 prisoners, 101 participated in the study. 60.4 % mentioned a moderate or poor health status, while the respective percentage before detention was 32.7 %. Health status deterioration and poor mental health were reported by more than half of the respondents. Additionally, the vast majority expressed raised feelings such as sadness, anxiety or discomfort which affected negatively their everyday life while in prison. Regarding risk factors during imprisonment; tobacco consumption has increased by 16.6 % and 7.9 % of the sample admitted having used drugs. Moreover, the access to and the quality of provided health services in prison were described as poor/ very poor by 46.5 % and 49.5 %, respectively. A significant correlation between the access to and the quality of health care services and health status was observed.   CONCLUSION Healthcare provision at the \"Korydallos\" prison is not satisfying since the access to as well as the quality of healthcare are not adequate. Imprisonment leads to deterioration of self-reported health status. Our findings should constitute a starting point for further research in order to introduce more effective interventions aiming at meeting prisoners' health needs.", "citation_paragraph": "Incarceration rates have increased by approximately 25-30 % over the last 15 years [1] . In 2013, more than 10.2 million people were incarcerated in rehabilitation centers as either pre-trial prisoners or serving sentence [1] . Female prison population has also increased by an average of 16 % worldwide in the years 2006-2012 [2] .Prisoners' health represents one of the major challenges for public health especially since the increasing incarceration rates has a direct impact on prisoners' overall health status. It has been reported that inmates experience high levels of physical and mental health problems relating to the prison environment, which is characterized by isolation, communal life, violence, insecurity, threat and overcrowding [3] . The high prevalence of prisoners' health related problems seems to be attributed to numerous socio-economic characteristics, such as poverty, low income, and low education level [4] [5] [6] [7] . Furthermore, empirical data reveal that prisoners make use of health services in prisons 3 to 4 times more frequently than the general population, mainly due to the high levels of morbidity associated with the worsening of their physical and mental health status, as well as the everyday life while in prison [8, 9] .Prisoners' health status, access to health services and satisfaction associated with the quality of the provided healthcare are issues that have drawn researchers' attention internationally. It has been widely reported that prisoners have generally poor access to health services and usually do not receive the appropriate care [10] [11] [12] . The high rates of chronic and mental disorders, as well as the high prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases during imprisonment, are significant public health issues that require measures aiming at improving prisoners' access to health services [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] .Prisoners' health status, as well as the incidence of different diseases varies by gender and age group [18] [19] [20] [21] . In women, significant biological changes occur, which are more critical and evident in some age groups in relation to men [22, 23] .

In high-risk prostate cancer, disease recurrence after primary therapy may occur at either distant or local sites. Ongoing studies are in the process of evaluating systemic therapy for the eradication of local and micrometastatic disease. Neoadjuvant therapies offer the opportunity to maximize local control as a path to improved outcomes and critically evaluate agent effectiveness in the target tissue.

It is likely that the development of effective strategies based on understanding prostate tumor biology will lead to significant advances in the treatment of this disease.", "citation_paragraph": "Prostate cancer is the most common visceral cancer in Western countries and the second most lethal cancer among men [1] . Presently, a man's lifetime risk of prostate cancer is about 17%. Because prostate cancer is a disease of aging, these odds are likely to rise as longevity increases due to improvements in health care and lifestyle habits. Prostate cancer is a heterogeneous disease with wide variability in clinical outcomes. Although some tumors progress rapidly despite aggressive measures, many remain indolent and localized for a number of years. Approximately 3% of all US men, or about one in six of all prostate cancer patients, will die of this disease [1] . The early identification of these lethal cases with application of effective treatment is what is needed in order to improve prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM). It is well known that factors such as Gleason score are highly predictive for oncologic outcomes. In a population-based study by Albertsen et al. [2] , the risk of PCSM was 16-fold higher in men with highgrade cancer compared with those with low-grade cancer. This need for better characterization of prostate cancer was recently highlighted in two randomized studies of prostate cancer screening for very early cancer. With intermediate follow-up, these studies showed little or no benefit to prostate cancer screening compared with observation [3, 4] . However, in these trials less than 10% of all subjects had high-grade cancers at the time of diagnosis. Thus, they were not likely to show a survival benefit without extended follow-up.High-risk localized prostate cancer has previously been defined as disease recurrence after primary therapy that exceeds 50% [5] . Given the biologic variability resulting in a wide variance of clinical outcomes, it is important to stratify patients into high-risk groups so that either suitable therapy or the chance at participation in clinical trials can be offered to this select group. The availability of clinical trials that offer promising new approaches for such patients is warranted considering the high rate of disease recurrence even when treatment intensity is maximized.

This can be achieved either definitively with a primed contrast infusion (infusion ECV), or sufficiently with a delay postbolus (bolus-only ECV). For large ECV, the bolus-only approach measures higher than the infusion ECV, causing some uncertainty in diseases such as amyloidosis.   PURPOSE To characterize the relationship between the bolus-only and current gold-standard infusion ECV in patients with amyloidosis.   STUDY TYPE Bolus-only and infusion ECV were prospectively measured.   POPULATION In all, 186 subjects with systemic amyloidosis attending our clinic and 23 subjects with systemic amyloidosis who were participating in an open-label, two-part, dose-escalation, phase 1 trial.   FIELD STRENGTH Avanto 1.5T, Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany.   ASSESSMENT Bolus-only and infusion ECV were measured in all subjects using shortened modified Look-Locker inversion recovery (ShMOLLI) T1 mapping sequence.   STATISTICAL TESTS Pearson correlation coefficient (r); Bland-Altman; receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Linear regression model with a fractional polynomial transformation.   RESULTS The difference between the bolus-only and infusion myocardial ECV increased as the average of the two measures increased, with the bolus-ECV measuring higher. For an average ECV of 0.4, the difference was 0.013. The 95% limits of agreement for the two methods, after adjustment for the bias, were \u00b10.056. However, cardiac diagnostic accuracy was comparable (bolus-only vs. infusion ECV area under the curve [AUC] = 0.839 vs. 0.836), as were correlations with other clinical cardiac measures, and, in the trial patients, the ability to track changes in the liver/spleen with therapy.   DATA CONCLUSION In amyloidosis, with large ECVs, the bolus-only technique reads higher than the infusion technique, but clinical performance by any measure is the same. Given the work-flow advantages, these data suggest that the bolus-only approach might be acceptable for amyloidosis, and might support its use as a surrogate endpoint in future clinical trials.

The extent or severity of cardiac involvement in amyloidosis can be described by ventricular wall thickness, systodiastolic dysfunction, and the degree of transmurality of late gadolinium enhancement in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 3 but none of these techniques provide a quantitative estimate of the amyloid deposits. The burden of amyloid deposition can be quantified noninvasively with T 1 mapping by cardiovascular MR.2 T 1 mapping measures myocardial longitudinal magnetic relaxation, and can be performed before and after infusion of a gadolinium-based contrast agent. The contrast agent distributes to the extracellular space and blood plasma such that the relative contrast signal changes measure the myocardial extracellular volume (ECV) fraction. 4 This measurement assumes that the distribution of the contrast agent within blood and myocardium is at equilibrium, established by the administration of a primed slow intravenous contrast infusion. However, this technique is complex and timeconsuming. An alternative approach involves approximation of the ECV utilizing the dynamic equilibration achieved by delayed postbolus measurement. 5 This bolus-only technique has proven to be sufficient across a wide range of cardiac diseases, 6 with advantages of speed and simplicity. However, there is an increasing bias between results of the bolus and infusion techniques in pathologies characterized by higher ECV, such as amyloidosis or the zone of a myocardial infarct. 6 Understanding the relationship between the two techniques for measuring ECV would be advantageous in order to apply the simpler bolus-only ECV method to large clinical populations and imminent clinical trials of treatments created to eliminate amyloid deposits. 7, 8 The aims of the study were to: 1) characterize the relationship between the bolus-only and current gold-standard infusion cardiac ECV measurements in patients with amyloidosis and quantify the level of agreement between the two techniques; 2) compare the bolus and infusion ECV techniques in terms of: a) cardiac diagnostic accuracy; b) correlation with clinical cardiac measures; c) reproducibility in the heart; and d) ability to track changes in amyloid load in the liver and spleen in response to treatment.", "citance": "The extent or severity of cardiac involvement in amyloidosis can be described by ventricular wall thickness, systodiastolic dysfunction, and the degree of transmurality of late gadolinium enhancement in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 3 but none of these techniques provide a quantitative estimate of the amyloid deposits.", "claims": [{"text": "The severity of cardiac involvement in amyloidosis can be described by the degree of transmurality of late gadolinium enhancement in MRI.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 8000205, "title": "BK channels mediate pathway-specific modulation of visual signals in the in vivo mouse retina.", "abstract": "The modulatory role of large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (BK) channels in the nervous system has been extensively studied. In the retina, it has been shown that BK channels play a pivotal role in modulating feedback from A17 amacrine cells to rod bipolar cells (RBCs). Here, we used electroretinography to examine the functional role of BK channels for rod and cone vision in the retina in vivo using a genetically engineered mouse lacking functional BK channels (Bk(-/-)). Under dark-adapted and light-adapted conditions, the lack of BK channels had no effect on photoreceptor activity, suggesting that these ion channels do not modulate photoreceptor responses. At the bipolar cell level, the ERG signals attributed to RBCs in Bk(-/-) mice were not different from those in wild-type mice at low scotopic stimulus intensities. However, at high scotopic and low mesopic stimulus intensities, close to RBC saturation, a significant reduction of ERG signals reflecting RBC activity was present in the Bk(-/-) retina. At higher mesopic stimulus intensities activating both RBCs and cone bipolar cells (CBCs), no difference in ERG signals between Bk(-/-) and wild-type mice was found. In photopic stimulus paradigms, activity of ON- and OFF-CBCs in Bk(-/-) and wild-type retinae was indistinguishable. These findings demonstrate that BK channels modulate visual responses in vivo at the bipolar cell level at intermediate stimulus conditions.", "citation_paragraph": "The single flash-evoked ERG b-wave is generated almost exclusively by activity of ON-bipolar cells (RBCs and ON-CBCs), as indicated by abolishment of the b-wave through knock-out of the ON-bipolar cell-specific mGluR6 glutamate receptor (Masu et al., 1995) . Therefore, the ERG b-wave is diagnostically used in vivo to detect functional alterations on the RBC and ON-CBC level, including an abnormal synaptic transmission between photoreceptors and ON-bipolar cells. In this study, we found that with increasing stimulus intensity, RBC responses (as indicated by the amplitude of the darkadapted single-flash ERG b-wave) were smaller in the Bk \u03ea/\u03ea mouse compared with control littermates. At high scotopic/low mesopic stimulus intensities, when Bk \u03ea/\u03ea mice showed a functional phenotype, RBCs do not encode single-photon but multiphoton events. Grimes et al. (2009) provided evidence that when BK channels on A17 dendrites are activated by synaptic input from RBCs, they reduce reciprocal inhibitory GABAergic feedback from A17s to RBC axon terminals. Their study suggests that BK channel activity regulates signal transmission from RBCs to AII amacrine cells, thus modulating the dynamic range of RBC output. Our ERG findings are in accordance with these data and, in addition, demonstrate for the first time that BK channels modulate visual responses at the bipolar cell level in vivo at low mesopic intensities close to RBC saturation, supporting the view that A17 feedback expands the dynamic range of RBCs. It is noteworthy that also other types of amacrine cells that contribute to the rod pathway may also express BK channels and play a role in modulating RBC activity. However, our anatomical and physio- logical results suggest that the \"central\" neurons of the rod pathway-rods and RBCs-do not express BK channels.In line with this view, BK channel-mediated modulation of GABAergic feedback from A17s to RBCs varies over the whole range of bipolar cell input: The reduction of feedback is more effective for smaller than for larger RBC output signals (Grimes et al., 2009 ). Thus, under very low signal-to-noise conditions (i.e., single-photon events) the GABAergic feedback appeared to be minimized by BK channels to allow small (and infrequent) signals to pass. Hence, the effect of BK channels is expected to be maximal using very dim light stimuli. In our study, we found a maximal reduction of RBC activity at low mesopic light stimuli at \u03f3\u03ea1 and \u03ea0.5 log cd*s/m 2 but not at the low scotopic stimulus intensities (\u03ea4 and \u03ea3 log cd*s/m 2 ). Because we could not detect any functional role for BK channel under low scotopic conditions, our finding is partly in contrast to that of Grimes et al. (2009) . Possible explanations for this contradiction may lie in the very different experimental situations (in vitro retinal slice vs in vivo eye) as well as the different stimulation methods (electric stimulation of RBCs vs light stimulation) in the two studies. Also, it has to be stated that at the visual threshold, when single photons are detected, the ERG method may provide insufficient sensitivity to detect the effects of BK channel-regulated feedback at RBC terminals.Pharmacological blockade of BK channels reduces lightevoked excitatory input signals to ganglion cells in the lightadapted mouse retina (Nemargut et al., 2009) , indicating that BK channels act presynaptic to ganglion cells, possibly at CBCs. It cannot be excluded that BK channels locally modulate transmitter release at CBC terminals without detectably affecting the integrated membrane potential of CBCs measured in ERGs. This would explain that in the present study no effect on CBCs was detected, whereas Nemargut et al. (2009) could detect a BK channel-dependent modulation when recording directly from ganglion cells. Furthermore, it is possible that bipolar cell terminal morphology plays a role in this as well: RBCs are electronically more compact than CBCs, which possess highly branched terminal systems with thin interconnecting neurites (W\u00e4ssle, 2004) .", "citance": "The single flash-evoked ERG b-wave is generated almost exclusively by activity of ON-bipolar cells (RBCs and ON-CBCs), as indicated by abolishment of the b-wave through knock-out of the ON-bipolar cell-specific mGluR6 glutamate receptor (Masu et al., 1995) .", "claims": [{"text": "The single flash-evoked ERG b-wave is generated by activity of ON-bipolar cells.", "subject": "single flash-evoked ERG b-wave", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 29483305, "title": "A novel role of KIF3b in the seminoma cell cycle", "abstract": "ABSTRACT KIF3b is a protein of the kinesin\u20102 family which plays an important role in intraflagellar transport. Testis cancer is a common cancer among young men. Its diagnostic rate is increasing and over half of the cases are seminomas. Many aspects of the mechanism and gene expression background of this cancer remain unclear. Using western\u2010blotting and semi\u2010quantitative PCR we found high protein levels of KIF3b enrichment in seminoma tissue despite the mRNA levels remaining equivalent to that of normal testicular tissues. The distribution of KIF3b was mainly in cells with division potential. Wound\u2010healing assays and cell counting kit assays showed that the knockdown of KIF3b significantly suppressed cell migration ability, viability and number in HeLa cells. Immunofluorescence images during the cell cycle revealed that KIF3b tended to gather at the spindles and was enriched at the central spindle. This indicated that KIF3b may also have direct impacts upon spindle formation and cytokinesis. By counting the numbers of nuclei, spindles and cells, we found that the rates of multipolar division and multi\u2010nucleation were raised in KIF3b\u2010knockdown cells. In this way we demonstrate that KIF3b functions importantly in mitosis and may be essential to seminoma cell division and proliferation as well as being necessary for normal cell division. HIGHLIGHTSA significant upregulation of KIF3b is detected in seminoma.Knockdown of KIF3b impacts on cell proliferation and migration.KIF3b may have direct impacts upon spindle formation and cytokinesis.", "citation_paragraph": "It has been widely accepted that KIF3b functions mainly in the transportation of some protein complexes near the cell membrane and is involved in intraflagellar transport and cilium assembly [23] [24] [25] . Our report shows that KIF3b participates not only in these interphase cell activities, but is also active in mitosis events such as spindle formation and cytokinesis. KIF3b may thus play an important role in seminoma tumorigenesis.During a normal cell cycle, KIF3b begins to gather and be enriched at the spindle central spindle along the spindle microtubules, as we found in our own studies (Fig. 4) . As previously reported, some kinesin like proteins and kinesin complexes such as KIFC3 and kinesin-6 are confirmed participants in cytokinesis [26, 27] . Now our report suggests that KIF3b also has a critical role in cytokinesis. As KIF3b's activity is very directly concerned with transportation and localization near the cytomembrane, it may be necessary for cells to use KIF3b as a transport motor to establish cytokinesis-associated compounds and new membrane protein complex systems for incorporation onto new membranes. Thus, knockdown of KIF3b resulted of the aberrant division of some HeLa cells resulting in the presence of multinucleate cells. Cytokinesis failure can also result in multipolar spindles [28] . It has been confirmed that the sliding activity of the kinesin-8 protein Kip3 promotes bipolar spindle assembly [29] . Cells which lack the kinesin-14 protein Kar3 may have a monopolar spindles or two dissociated half-spindles [30] . Since kinesin-2 cannot mediate microtubule sliding, KIF3b may function in spindle formation by transporting spindle assembly-associated cargos. Moreover, under ordinary conditions, after entering prophase from interphase KIF3b is clustered together near the centrosome (Fig. 4) . This indicates that KIF3b may be involved in the replication and localization of centrosomes. Therefore, reduction of KIF3b can cause centrosome replication and localization disorders which could act to further induce multipolar spindles. Though abnormal mitosis provides cancer cells an increased number of chromosomes and mutations which allow cancer cells to be more aggressive and uncontrollable [31] , a rapid decrease of KIF3b like RNAi-mediated knockdown can also suppress cancer cell proliferation.KIF3b is also distributed in the cell cortex near the cell membrane (Fig. 4) . As has showed in previous reports, kinesin-2 mediated IFT is involved in primary cilia formation [32] [33] [34] [35] . Therefore, the silencing of KIF3b will surely have an impact on ciliogenesis. Many signaling pathways including Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling and Hedgehog signaling are dependent on primary cilia and IFT [36] [37] [38] [39] . Wnt proteins play key roles in regulation of cell cycle and the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway is involved in cell migration, cell proliferation and tumorigenesis [39] [40] [41] [42] . Consequently, KIF3b can participate in tumorigenesis through Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling. Meanwhile, kinesin-2 mediated transport has been strongly implicated in the transport of the cell adhesion related proteins N-cadherin and APC [21, 43] . Thus, KIF3b is likely to be critical to cancer cell migration.In seminomas, whose genetic expression background is still far from clear, we found that although there is no difference in mRNA levels, KIF3b protein levels were significantly upregulated compared to those of normal testis tissue. This indicates something must have happened to post-transcriptional regulation. In some animals the gene expression level of kif3b in testis tissues is essentially lower than that in most of other organs or tissues [44, 45] . From this observation we can suggest a hypothesis. To match the requirement of the active division of cancer cells and to keep mitosis occurring properly, the translation of kif3b mRNA is strongly enhanced in seminomas. However, further research relating to the detailed mechanisms of such a process is required.", "citance": "It has been confirmed that the sliding activity of the kinesin-8 protein Kip3 promotes bipolar spindle assembly [29] .", "claims": [{"text": "The sliding activity of kinesin-8 protein Kip3 promotes bipolar spindle assembly.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Emerging evidence indicates that strict control of HSC metabolism is also essential for their life-long functions (Suda et al., 2011; Manesia et al., 2015) , but the key metabolic regulators that ensure stem cell integrity remain elusive. Although highly proliferative fetal liver (FL) HSCs use oxygen-dependent pathways for energy generation (Suda et al., 2011; Manesia et al., 2015) , adult HSCs are known to suppress the flux of glycolytic metabolites into the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and heavily rely on glycolysis to maintain their quiescent state (Simsek et al., 2010; Takubo et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014) . Whereas pharmacological inhibition of glycolytic flux into the TCA cycle enhances HSC activity upon transplantation (Takubo et al., 2013) , severe block of glycolysis (i.e., Ldha deletion) and a consequent elevated mitochondrial respiration abolishes HSC maintenance (Wang et al., 2014) .

We conclude that both contact-dependent and contact-independent interactions with aggressive competing bacterial species and viruses can induce production of ROS in E. coli target cells.T6SS | reactive oxygen species | interspecies competition | antibiotics | phage M icrobial species exist predominantly in complex communities in the natural environment and animal hosts. To survive in a multispecies environment, bacteria have developed various strategies to compete with other species. For example, some bacteria can exert long-range inhibitory effects by secreting diffusible molecules, such as antibiotics, bacteriocins, and H 2 O 2 (1), whereas others require direct cell-to-cell contact to kill nearby organisms (2, 3) . One such contact-dependent inhibitory system is the type VI secretion system (T6SS), a protein translocating nanomachine expressed by many Gram-negative bacterial pathogens that can kill both bacterial and eukaryotic cells (3) (4) (5) . Structurally analogous to an inverted bacteriophage tail, the T6SS delivers effectors into target cells by using a contractile sheath to propel an inner tube out of the producer cell and into nearby target cells. The inner tube (composed of Hcp protein) is thought to carry toxic effector proteins within its lumen or on its tip, which is decorated with VgrG and PAAR proteins (4, 6, 7) . Given that some cells can detect T6SS attack but not suffer any measurable loss in viability (8, 9) , it would seem that cell killing is likely due to the toxicity of effectors rather than membrane disruptions caused by insertion of the spear-like VgrG/PAAR/Hcp tube complex. T6SS-dependent effectors can attack a number of essential cellular targets, including the cell wall (10, 11) , membranes (11, 12) , and nucleic acids (13) , and thus can mimic the actions of antibiotics and bacteriocins. As a model prey or target organism, Escherichia coli can be killed by the T6SS activities of a number of bacteria including Vibrio cholerae (14) , Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10, 15) , and Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 (7).Collins and coworkers (16) (17) (18) have reported that antibiotic treatment of E. coli elicits the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting from a series of events involving perturbation of the central metabolic pathway, NADPH depletion, and the Fenton reaction. ROS can cause lethal damage to DNA, lipid, and proteins (19, 20) and thus can contribute to cell death in combination with the deleterious effects of antibiotics on their primary targets. The idea that antibiotics kill bacterial cells, in part, through the action of ROS has been supported by a number of follow-up studies (18, (21) (22) (23) but has also been challenged by others as a result of observations contradictory to a model where ROS is the sole mediator of antibiotic lethality (24) (25) (26) . These observations include the fact that antibiotics kill under anaerobic conditions, oxidation of the hydroxyphenyl fluorescein fluorescence dye used to measure ROS levels is nonspecific, and the extracellular level of H 2 O 2 is not elevated by antibiotic treatment (24, 26) . To address these concerns, Dwyer et al. (27) used a panel of ROS-detection fluorescence dyes, a defined growth medium under stringent anaerobic conditions, and an in vivo H 2 O 2 enzymatic assay to study the effects of antibiotics on cells. The results further support that antibiotics induce ROS generation, which contributes to the efficacy of antibiotics in addition to their primary lethal actions (18, 27, 28) .", "citance": "The inner tube (composed of Hcp protein) is thought to carry toxic effector proteins within its lumen or on its tip, which is decorated with VgrG and PAAR proteins (4, 6, 7) .", "claims": [{"text": "The tip of the inner tube of the toxic type VI secretion system (T6SS) antibacterial effector in Escherichia coli (E. coli) carries toxic effector proteins.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "The tip of the inner tube of the toxic type VI secretion system (T6SS) antibacterial effector in Escherichia coli (E. coli) is decorated with VgrG and PAAR proteins.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

For example, H. pylori uses NixA, AbcABCD, and the outer membrane transporter HP1512 to take up Ni 2+ , and deletion of these genes leads to reductions in urease activity (73) (74) (75) (76) . Of additional interest, hypA and hypB of this microorganism are required for urease activity, but the corresponding gene products are not involved in Ni 2+ uptake (77) . A direct competition is observed between HypA and UreG for binding UreE (78) . HypA and HypB are generally associated with metallocenter biosynthesis of [NiFe] hydrogenases, but they appear to serve a dual role here of still undefined function.Missing Accessory Proteins-Plants appear to lack homologues to ureE (3) and a large number ureolytic microorganisms lack one or more of the standard set of urease genes (9, 79) . A dramatic example of this situation exists in Bacillus subtilis where the genome reveals the presence of only the structural urease genes; nevertheless, the cells synthesize an active nickel urease, though with poor efficiency (80) . In many other cases, however, the sequenced microorganisms were not examined for urease activity.Iron Urease-Helicobacter mustelae, a gastric pathogen of ferrets, contains two urease gene clusters: ureABIEFGH and ureA2B2 (81) . The former cluster, closely related to that found in H. pylori, is induced by Ni 2+ and encodes two structural genes, a proton-gated urea channel (82) , and the four standard maturation proteins. The latter cluster is inversely regulated by Ni 2+ and encodes only the two structural genes (83). Urease activity is retained in ureB and ureB/ureG mutants, indicating that ureA2B2 encodes an active urease and its activation does not require the standard urease-specific GTPase. This finding was confirmed and extended by results showing that heterologous expression of ureA2B2 in E. coli generates active enzyme (84) . Purified UreAB is a conventional nickel urease, while isolated UreA2B2 is an oxygen-labile iron-containing enzyme. The structure of oxidized UreA2B2, a dodecamer like that shown in Fig. 1B , reveals a dinuclear active site that is remarkably similar to the metallocenter of conventional ureases (84) . This finding is consistent with the high degree of similarity in their sequences; e.g., UreA is 57% identical to UreA2 and UreB is 70% identical to UreB2. Two other strains of Helicobacter, H. felis and H. acinonychis, have similar arrangements of urease genes. The hosts of these pathogens, both in the Felidae (cat) family, are carnivores like the ferret, leading to speculation that these bacteria have evolved an iron urease because of their association with meat diets that are rich in iron and depleted in nickel (83). When the three UreA2B2 sequences are aligned and compared to the sequences of nickel ureases, a prominent cluster of distinct residues are seen to encircle the channel into the active site (84) . These results are compatible with an interaction between UreA2B2 apoprotein and an iron delivery protein. One possibility is that activation of iron urease makes use of a general iron delivery system that is used for maturation of the many iron proteins in the cell. The oxidized state of UreA2B2, suggested to be a \u00b5-oxo bridged Fe(III)-O-Fe(III) species, probably forms naturally within the microaerophilic microorganism, and the cell likely has a mechanism to regenerate the active diferrous species (85) . The ability to form active iron urease in E. coli using only ureA2B2 implies that ureasespecific accessory proteins are not required for Lys carbamylation.", "citance": "The former cluster, closely related to that found in H. pylori, is induced by Ni 2+ and encodes two structural genes, a proton-gated urea channel (82) , and the four standard maturation proteins.", "claims": [{"text": "The ureABIEFGH gene cluster encodes a proton gated urea channel.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "The ureABIEFGH gene cluster encodes urease maturation proteins : UreD/UreH, UreE, UreF, and UreG.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "The ureABIEFGH gene cluster is induced by nickel (II) ion.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

{"s2orc_id": 22731418, "title": "Targeting Microvasculature for Neuroprotection after SCI", "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) is characterized by secondary degeneration, which leads to tissue loss at the epicenter and subsequent functional deficits. This review provides insight into the pathophysiology of microvascular dysfunction and endothelial cell loss, which are among the earliest responses during the first postinjury day. The enigmatic role of the angiogenic response in the penumbra around the lost tissue, which occurs during the first 2 weeks, is also discussed. The importance of stabilizing and rescuing the injured vasculature is now well-recognized, and several pharmacological and genetic treatments have emerged in the past few years. We conclude with suggestions for future experimental research, including development of vascular-selective treatments and exploitation of genetic models. In summary, vascular dysfunction following SCI is an important contributor to neurological deficits, as proposed long ago. However, there now appears to be new and potentially powerful opportunities for treating acute SCI by targeting the vascular responses.", "citation_paragraph": "Six neuroprotective agents have been taken as far as phase III clinical trials [89] , including methylprednisolone, naloxone, tirilazad mesylate, monosialoganglioside GM1, 4-aminopyridine, and tizanidine. Yet, none of these showed efficacy for their primary endpoint and none are approved by the Untied States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for SCI. Currently, the only neuroprotective treatment for SCI is methylprednisolone, but its use is controversial and its efficacy is debatable [90] . We, and others, have recognized that targeting of the vascular responses might change this dire picture. Several discoveries during the last decade of the molecular mechanisms involved in vascular dysfunction have led to a growing arsenal of experimental treatments. The studies presented in Table 1 . have demonstrated enhanced functional angiogenesis or vascular protection along with improvements in tissue-sparing and/or locomotor behavior signifying the clinical potential of a vascular therapeutic for SCI. Interestingly, several studies that show tissue-sparing and functional recovery also report improved vascularity with attenuated inflammation or improved vascularity with decreased apoptosis. Stabilization of the BSCB, as measured by large molecule extravasation postinjury, is another important indicator of vascular protection.As discussed, low blood pressure contributes to inadequate spinal cord perfusion. Treatment with the AAV-Ang-1 = adeno-associated virus-Ang-1; AAV-VEGF = adeno-associated virus-VEGF; BSCB = blood-spinal cord barrier; CXCL10 = C-X-C motif chemokine 10; MRI = magnetic resonance image; SCI = spinal cord injury; VEGFR = VEGF receptor; ZFP-VEGFA = zinc finger protein VEGF isoform A.CNS vasodilator nimodipine plus systemic vasopressors, such as adrenaline or volume expansion, but not individually, can maintain spinal cord blood flow and axonal conduction during the acute injury phase in rats [30, 91] . However, this is only accompanied by a moderate functional improvement [92] . One of the underlying problems is the damage and death of ECs caused in part by reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation of microvasculature [6, 40] , perhaps formed due to reperfusion injury [32] . In fact, treatments with the steroid tirilazad, antioxidants, or selenium maintain spinal cord blood flow and reduce leakage following contusive SCI [93, 95, 109] . Peroxynitrite-induced oxidative damage following SCI can be reduced by the nitroxide antioxidant Tempol [110] . The treatment has to be initiated within the first hour, perhaps consistent with a role for peroxynitrites in reperfusion injury to ECs. Heme-oxygenase (HO) is also a target for antioxidant intervention. HO reduces oxidative injury by catalyzing the conversion of the oxidant heme to the antioxidant biliverdin. HO-1 is the inducible form and is protective following SCI [42] . The pharmacological drug, hemin, induces HO-1 and is neuroprotective following SCI [96] . Hemin has already been approved by the FDA as an intravenous treatment for porphyria. Of interest is the fact that HO-1 activity is stimulated by endoplasmic reticulum stress in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) [111] , suggesting possible connections among these therapeutic interventions and further exemplifying the need to investigate the roles of VSMCs and pericytes in SCI recovery. Membrane channels also provide targets for therapeutic compounds. ECs greatly increase expression of sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1)-regulated NC Ca-ATP channels, such as transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 4 (Trpm4), and this contributes to the temporal and spatial expansion of secondary damage after SCI [98] . SUR1 is also newly expressed in humans with SCI, making this system a relevant target [97] . Due to ATP depletion in the ischemic spinal cord, channels like Trpm4 open, which causes depolarization leading to edema and EC death. Inhibition of SUR1 by genetic knockout or by treatment with antisense reduces microvascular fragmentation, hemorrhage, white matter loss, and functional deficits in rats and mice with cervical hemi-contusion injuries [97, 98] . The antisense is probably more efficacious than pharmacological inhibitors because it is expected to reduce the de novo expression. Trpm4 inhibition by either knockout in mice or antisense in rats has a similar neuroprotective effect [99] . Of note is that glibenclamide and repaglinide are both FDA-approved drugs for type II diabetes, and they also have such neuroprotective properties following SCI [98] . Glibenclamide is a sulfonylurea inhibitor that binds to SUR1 and repaglinide is known to block K ATP channels.To our knowledge, no published studies have attempted to selectively reduce hemorrhage and the toxicity of hemorrhagic blood, but it is possible that the antioxidants also reduce the toxicity of blood. There is likely a very fine line in trying to reduce bleeding and maintain spinal cord perfusion.Among the most direct support for the idea that EC dysfunction and death play a prominent role in secondary degeneration after SCI follows from work targeting the Tie2 receptor, which is almost exclusively present in ECs [112, 113] . Intravenous injections of Ang1 during the first week following a contusive SCI reduces white matter loss, inflammation, and locomotor deficits [83] . This is consistent with the known pro-survival role of Ang1 for ECs [50, 52, 114, 115] and the finding that Ang1 levels decrease following SCI [100] . The antiinflammatory effects may be due to its known downregulation of ICAM1, which is necessary for leukocyte binding [116] . Importantly, the treatment can be given with a 4-h delay, which would be sufficient time to make a diagnosis in human SCI cases and to allow the start of intravenous infusions.As discussed, the \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin also contributes to EC survival. Integrins have a reciprocal interaction with growth factor receptors [117] , and both \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin and Tie2 can activate the PI3K-Akt pathway in ECs [118, 119] . This may explain why a combined intravenous treatment with Ang1 and an \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin peptide agonist named C16 was even more effective in reducing the detrimental outcomes of contusive SCI in mice [83] . We have also shown that Ang-1 reduces permeability at 72 h following SCI [83] , most likely via the capacity of Ang-1 to preserve the integrity of EC tight junctions under pathological conditions [58, 120] . Others have also seen the BSCB stabilizing effects of Ang1 and that a combination of VEGF and Ang1 leads to improved functional recovery [100] .Finally, protection of ECs by a broad spectrum, selective protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) inhibitor also seems to result in protection of long-projecting axons [101] . PTPs are known to inhibit tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors and their downstream intracellular signaling tyrosine kinases. It remains to be determined which mechanisms underlie the PTP inhibition effects and whether this might include facilitating Tie2 signaling.", "citance": "Trpm4 inhibition by either knockout in mice or antisense in rats has a similar neuroprotective effect [99] .", "claims": [{"text": "There is a neuroprotective effect of Trpm4 inhibition in mice and rats.

{"s2orc_id": 482662, "title": "Pharmacological actions of statins: a critical appraisal in the management of cancer.", "abstract": "Statins, among the most commonly prescribed drugs worldwide, are cholesterol-lowering agents used to manage and prevent cardiovascular and coronary heart diseases. Recently, a multifaceted action in different physiological and pathological conditions has been also proposed for statins, beyond anti-inflammation and neuroprotection. Statins have been shown to act through cholesterol-dependent and -independent mechanisms and are able to affect several tissue functions and modulate specific signal transduction pathways that could account for statin pleiotropic effects. Typically, statins are prescribed in middle-aged or elderly patients in a therapeutic regimen covering a long life span during which metabolic processes, aging, and concomitant novel diseases, including cancer, could occur. In this context, safety, toxicity, interaction with other drugs, and the state of health have to be taken into account in subjects treated with statins. Some evidence has shown a dichotomous effect of statins with either cancer-inhibiting or -promoting effects. To date, clinical trials failed to demonstrate a reduced cancer occurrence in statin users and no sufficient data are available to define the long-term effects of statin use over a period of 10 years. Moreover, results from clinical trials performed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of statins in cancer did not suggest statin use as chemotherapeutic or adjuvant agents. Here, we reviewed the pharmacology of the statins, providing a comprehensive update of the current knowledge of their effects on tissues, biological processes, and pathological conditions, and we dissected the disappointing evidence on the possible future use of statin-based drugs in cancer therapy.", "citation_paragraph": "The ability of statins to influence bone metabolism was first reported by Mundy et al. (1999) , who screened a library of more than 30,000 natural compounds for osteoinductive substances. Only lovastatin was found to have this effect, with the consequent ability to stimulate new bone formation both in vitro, as observed in cultures of neonatal murine calvaria, and in vivo in animal models of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Similar effects were found with the lipophilic statins (simvastatin, mevastatin, and atorvastatin) (Sugiyama et al., 2000) that also now seem to be more effective than the hydrophilic statins (rosuvastatin and pravastatin) in protecting bone (Uzzan et al., 2007) . In a bisphosphonate-like manner, statins can also inhibit osteoclasts activation by preventing mevalonate production, which leads to the loss of prenylation of small GTPases and, consequently, disruption of downstream intracellular signaling pathways in osteoclasts (Dunford et al., 2006; Hughes et al., 2007) . Moreover, statins can finely modulate the osteoprotegerin/receptor activator of NF-B/receptor activator of NF-B ligand system that is a critical determinant for maintenance of skeletal integrity (Kaji et al., 2005; Ahn et al., 2008a) . The bone anabolic action of statins also involves an increased expression and synthesis of osteocalcin by reducing the inhibitory effect of Rho-associated kinase in human osteoblasts (Ohnaka et al., 2001 ). Statins are also able to partially suppress osteoblast apoptosis through a TGF-\u2424-Smad3 pathway (Kaji et al., 2008) and regulation of estrogen receptor \u2423 expression . Moreover, the proliferation and recruitment of osteoprogenitor cells, critical steps in the early stages of bone healing, were enhanced by simvastatin-stimulated TGF-\u24241 and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (Nyan et al., 2010) . In addition to direct effects on bone, statins may increase bone formation by other indirect actions. Vascular invasion is a prerequisite for calcification during endochondral bone formation (Gerber et al., 1999) ; thus, the well established proangiogenic effect of statins might increase bone formation. Statins may also affect bone formation indirectly by inhibiting inflammation that is responsible for an imbalance in bone metabolism by favoring bone resorption (Tikiz et al., 2004; Tanaka et al., 2005) .). It is noteworthy that Yavuz et al. (2009) have described an interesting relationship between statins and the vitamin D physiology that might represent a new pleiotropic effect of this class of drugs with great bone anabolic potential.Of course, the next major question that arises is whether statins really would have beneficial effects on human bone by increasing bone mineral density (BMD) and consequently reducing fracture risk. Edwards et al. (2000) ) published the first study in postmenopausal women to indicate a significant increase in BMD associated with statin administration. Next, statins have also been shown to exhibit a protective effect against nonpathological fractures among older women (Chan et al., 2000; Chung et al., 2000; Meier et al., 2000; Wang et al., 2000c) . With regard to the effects of statins on BMD, more recent evidence came from results of the studies on this endpoint in patients in treatment with statins for hypercholesterolemia. Overall, patients taking statins have a higher femoral bone mass density (by a mean \u03ee 0.2 S.D.) (Safaei et al., 2007; Uysal et al., 2007; Uzzan et al., 2007; P\u00e9rez-Castrill\u00f3n et al., 2008; Tang et al., 2008) . However, these studies have been conducted on small case series, so differences identified are minimal and fail to reach statistical significance (Luisetto and Camozzi, 2009) . A recent large, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of atorvastatin showed instead a negative effect on bone mineral density and bone markers in dyslipidemic postmenopausal women (Bone et al., 2007) , confirming data obtained in other past studies (Bjarnason et al., 2001; Stein et al., 2001; Braatvedt et al., 2004) . A systematic review by Yue et al. (2010) of all randomized controlled trials involving postmenopausal women (3022 subjects) found that statin use does not prevent fractures or increase bone density in these subjects. At the same time, a recent prospective randomized control trial study enrolling 212 patients with hyperlipidemia and osteopenia has received particular attention in view of the positive effect of simvastatin to significantly increase bone mineral density and bone markers (serum c-telopeptide of type 1 collagen and N-terminal propeptide of procollagen type 1) even though, like many others, this study also suffers from some limitations and confounders that do not clarify whether statins are beneficial in either preventing and/or slowing bone loss in the aging osteoporotic population (Chuengsamarn et al., 2010) . No clinical trials focusing on the statin effects on the reduction of fracture risk have been reported. In 2000, a first observational study found an inverse association between hip fractures and statin use (Wang et al., 2000c) . After that, small retrospective studies (Chung et al., 2000; Meier et al., 2001; Pasco et al., 2002; Scranton et al., 2005) and a meta-analysis (Bauer et al., 2004) showed a lower risk of fractures. At the same time, a randomized trial (Bone et al., 2007) and three large population-based studies (van Staa et al., 2001; LaCroix et al., 2003 LaCroix et al., , 2008 together with two previous cardiovascular prevention trials (Pedersen and Kjekshus, 2000; Reid et al., 2001) , analyzed a posteriori, showed no benefits. These negative findings were recently confirmed by a very large population-based cohort study conducted to assess the effect of statins on a range of health outcomes (Smeeth et al., 2009) . Likewise, in the last few months, another large population-based cohort study failed to confirm a protective effect of statins on the risk of osteoporotic fractures (Hippisley-Cox and Coupland, 2010) . These disparate results can be explained by different possible reasons: differences in trial design; insufficiently large control group; patient identification methods; statin use definitions; insufficient dose to affect 118 bone; insufficient treatment duration; inclusion and exclusion criteria; and confounding factors controlled for obesity, physical activity, use of other drugs and comorbidities, diagnostic methods used, lack of objective assessment of fracture, and so called \"publication bias.\"Overall, the beneficial effects are largely reported from studies with weaker study design, such as case-control trials. These observations suggest that there is clearly a need for properly conducted, adequately powered, randomized controlled clinical trials to assess conclusively whether statins could potentially reduce fracture rates. Until that moment, patients at high risk of fractures should be treated with currently approved medications.", "citance": "In 2000, a first observational study found an inverse association between hip fractures and statin use (Wang et al., 2000c) .", "claims": [{"text": "There is a positive correlation between hip fractures and statin use.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "There is an inverse relationship between hip fractures and statin use.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Our aim was to resurvey neonatal practitioners to determine current practice and whether it was now evidence based.   METHODS A questionnaire was sent to all 207 UK neonatal units.   RESULTS Responses were obtained from 84% of units. The most frequent 'investigation' was a trial of therapy (83% of units); pH studies were used in 38%, upper GI contrast studies in 19% and multichannel intraluminal impedance (MII)/pH studies in 5%. Only six units suggested a threshold for an abnormal pH study and two units for an abnormal MII study. Infants were commenced on antireflux medication without investigation always in 32% of units, often in 29%, occasionally in 19% and only never in 1%. Gaviscon was used as first line treatment in 60% of units, and other medications included ranitidine in 53%, thickening agents in 27%, proton pump inhibitors in 23%, domperidone in 22% and erythromycin in 6%.   CONCLUSION There remains a wide variation in diagnostic and treatment strategies for infants with suspected GOR on neonatal intensive care units, emphasising the need for randomised trials to determine appropriate GOR management.", "citation_paragraph": "We had demonstrated that there was a wide variation in the current investigation and management strategies for infants with suspected GORD being cared for on UK neonatal units. The previous survey (3) also showed a similar wide variation, but was only of prematurely born infants cared for in level two and three neonatal units. In our survey, all 207 neonatal units of all levels were surveyed with an 84% response rate. In addition, we asked about practice for all infants, regardless of maturity at birth.A trial of therapy was the most commonly used approach to diagnose GORD, and few neonatal units had access to pH or MII studies. Yet, although the latest guidelines from ESPGHAN conclude there is little evidence for any investigation of GORD in infants including neonates, they state that if there is a strong suspicion that reflux is contributing to apnoea combined pH/MII and polysomnography would be helpful. Indeed, addition of MII monitoring to conventional pH monitoring improved the diagnostic yield in 16 symptomatic preterm infants and seven neonates with apnoea (4). In contrast, in 54 infants with ages from one day to 330 days, the prevalence of GOR as detected by MIIpH was low (10%), despite the infants having a strong clinical suspicion for reflux (5) . In addition, in another study, the majority of suspected clinical reflux behaviours did not correlate with reflux events (6) .In the 2004 survey, 30% of units used pH monitoring on a regular basis (3). The current survey revealed that still only a minority of units (34%) were using pH monitoring, perhaps reflecting the poor correlation between symptoms and the results of investigations (7) and/or the problems with interpreting the results. Reflex events are diagnosed if there is a reduction in the oesophageal pH below four. In infants, it has been suggested that such criteria may be of limited use as the gastric contents can be buffered by milk (8) . The concerns regarding the buffering effect of milk, however, were based on data from studies with small numbers of heterogeneous groups of patients (9, 10) . Other studies have shown that gastric pH dispersion is not homogeneous, and have failed to find a significant effect of gastric buffering on the reflux index (11, 12) .In one study, although no statistically significant correlation was found between the pH reflux index and the duration of treatment, a significant correlation was demonstrated between MII results and the duration of treatment, but the correlation was weak (r 2 =0.36) (13) . In another study, amongst 64 infants with GOR symptoms who underwent MII/pH monitoring in the first weeks after birth and then sequentially over the next three years, impedance bolus exposure index and proximal reflux frequency were most predictive of the duration of symptoms (5). Yet, we found only 5% of units used this technique. Only two units gave a threshold for an abnormal MII study, both used more than 50 events in 24 hours, whereas the recommended standard is 100 events in 24 hours. Upper GI contrast studies were used in 23% of units to diagnose GORD and, although they have a role in investigating anatomical abnormalities, they cannot quantify the frequency of reflux events and hence determine the severity (14, 15) .We have demonstrated that there remains a wide variety of medications used for GORD. Gaviscon was the most commonly used treatment, perhaps reflecting it has minimal side effects (16) . Gaviscon, however, is contraindicated in those with known or suspected impairment of renal function and should not be given with other preparations that contain thickening agents. Gaviscon is an alginatebased formulation and acts as a physical protection of the gastric mucosa. In the presence of gastric acid, sodium alginate precipitates to form a low-density but viscous gel. The sodium bicarbonate, usually contained in such formulations, is converted to carbon dioxide and is entrapped within the gel, forming a foam, which floats on the surface of gastric content, preferentially moving into the oesophagus instead of acidic gastric contents during GOR episodes. Gaviscon \u00e2 , however, did not reduce the frequency of GORrelated apnoeas in 28 preterm infants studied with a six hour recording of combined MII and pH monitoring and polysomnography (17) . Other medications that include histamine two receptor blockers, such as ranitidine and proton pump inhibitors, for example omeprazole, have been shown to be efficacious in reducing gastric acid secretions and increasing gastric pH. Omeprazole administered at a daily dose of 0.7 mg/kg to preterm infants with suspected GORD reduced acid GOR frequency and the overall degree of oesophageal acid exposure (18) . In a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of infants aged three months to 12 months with GOR and/ or oesophagitis, omeprazole compared to placebo significantly reduces oesophageal acid exposure, but not irritability (19) . In contrast, Omari et al. (20) demonstrated esomeprazole resulted in a significant decrease in the number of acid bolus reflux episodes and GORD-related symptoms (20) . Both proton pump inhibitors and histamine two (H 2 ) receptor blockers, however, have been associated with increased rates of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) and serious bacterial infections (21) . A systematic review, which included one case-controlled and one prospective cohort study, demonstrated a significant association between NEC and inhibitors of gastric acid production, as well as a higher incidence of infection (sepsis and pneumonia) (22) . In a subsequent review, which included two retrospective and one prospective study, none of which were randomised, a significant association between use of ranitidine and an increased incidence of NEC was reported (23) . Furthermore, 12 of 33 VLBW neonates who received H 2 antagonists developed blood stream infections, compared to 30 of 343 who did not receive the antagonist (24) . A possible explanation is that the reduced gastric acid production might result in enhanced bacterial survival and gut colonisation, increasing the risk of NEC development.Dopamine receptor antagonists, such as the macrolides domperidone and erythromycin, have been reported to improve clinical symptoms, pH study indices and histological changes on oesophageal biopsy in older children with GORD compared to placebo. A systematic review evaluating the use of domperidone in the treatment of GORD in infants (25) , however, concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support their use. Domperidone can precipitate cardiac arrhythmias (26) , yet this survey showed it was currently used in 22% of UK neonatal units. Erythromycin use has been associated with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (27) , but was currently used for GORD in 6% of units.Thickening agents were currently used in 27% of units. A new preterm formula thickened with amylopectin used in 28 symptomatic preterm newborns was shown to reduce the number of acid GOR episodes detected by pH monitoring, but not nonacid GORs as detected by MII monitoring (28) . Similarly, a study of 24 prematurely born infants demonstrated thickening a formula with amylopectin did reduce acid GOR, but not nonacid GOR indexes nor GORrelated apnoeas (29) . A survey of neonatal feeding therapists and providers demonstrated that the majority were using thickened feeds for dysphagia or GORD, but noted variability in prescriptions for thickening agents regarding consistencies, thickening agents and recipes (30) .In conclusion, we have demonstrated there is wide variation regarding investigation and medication use in infants with suspected GORD in neonatal units in the UK. As in 2004, this likely reflects the limited evidence base and highlights the need for appropriate studies to inform best practice.", "citance": "Erythromycin use has been associated with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (27) , but was currently used for GORD in 6% of units.", "claims": [{"text": "There is a relation between Erythromycin use and hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.", "subject": "Erythromycin use", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "There is no relation between Erythromycin use and hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.", "subject": "Erythromycin use", "is_negation": true}]}

Several studies suggest that multiple births may be associated with a lowered breast cancer risk of about 10\u201330%, but results were inconsistent across 18 studies. The majority of 13 studies suggest about a 20\u201330% reduction in risk with preeclampsia and/or gestational hypertension. Six of seven studies reported no association for infant sex and breast cancer risk. Data are sparse and conflicting for other pregnancy characteristics such as gestational age, fetal growth, pregnancy weight gain, gestational diabetes, and placental abnormalities. The most consistent findings in a generally sparse literature are that multiple births and preeclampsia may modestly reduce breast cancer risk. Additional research is needed to elucidate associations between pregnancy characteristics, related hormonal profiles, and breast cancer risk.", "citation_paragraph": "Two studies have examined placental characteristics and breast cancer risk [15, 81] .

A small (146 cases) cohort study that followed-up participants of the CHDS [81] examined placental characteristics (e.g., placental weight and diameter) and found some evidence for a decrease in breast cancer risk associated with smaller placentas.

{"s2orc_id": 4633298, "title": "Most Important Factors for the Implementation of Shared Decision Making in Sciatica Care: Ranking among Professionals and Patients", "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Due to the increasing specialization of medical professionals, patients are treated by multiple disciplines. To ensure that delivered care is patient-centered, it is crucial that professionals and the patient together decide on treatment (shared decision making (SDM)). However, it is not known how SDM should be integrated in multidisciplinary practice. This study determines the most important factors for SDM implementation in sciatica care, as it is known that a prior inventory of factors is crucial to develop a successful implementation strategy.   METHODS 246 professionals (general practitioners, physical therapists, neurologists, neurosurgeons, orthopedic surgeons) (30% response) and 155 patients (96% response) responded to an internet-based survey. Respondents ranked barriers and facilitators identified in previous interviews, on their importance using Maximum Difference Scaling. Feeding back the personal top 5 most important factors, each respondent indicated whether these factors were barriers or facilitators. Hierarchical Bayes estimation was used to estimate the relative importance (RI) of each factor.   RESULTS Professionals assigned the highest importance to: quality of professional-patient relationship (RI 4.87; CI 4.75-4.99); importance of quick recovery of patient (RI 4.83; CI 4.69-4.97); and knowledge about treatment options (RI 6.64; CI 4.53-4.74), which were reported as barrier and facilitator. Professionals working in primary care had a different ranking than those working in hospital care. Patients assigned the highest importance to: correct diagnosis by professionals (barrier, RI 8.19; CI 7.99-8.38); information provision about treatment options and potential harm and benefits (RI 7.87; CI 7.65-8.08); and explanation of the professional about the care trajectory (RI 7.16; CI 6.94-7.38), which were reported as barrier and facilitator.   CONCLUSIONS Knowledge, information provision and a good relationship are the most important conditions for SDM perceived by both patients and professionals. These conditions are not restricted to one specific disease or health care system, because they are mostly professional or patient dependent and require healthcare professional training.", "citation_paragraph": "Sciatica is a common disorder with prevalence reported up to 43% [1] . It is mostly caused by a herniated disc with compression of the nerve root, which gives radiating leg pain. Seventy percent of patients with sciatica recover in the first 6-8 weeks with conservative treatment [2] . After 6-8 weeks it is possible to consider prolonged conservative treatment or surgery. Care to sciatica patients is given by various disciplines: the general practitioner, physical therapist, neurologist and neurosurgeon or orthopedic surgeon are frequently involved.A large, randomized clinical trial showed no significant difference in clinical outcomes between conservative treatment and surgery after 1 and 2 years in patients with sciatica [3] . Other, low quality studies showed conflicting results [4] . As the literature is not consistent regarding the best treatment option [3, 4] , the choice can be considered preference sensitive. Therefore, the Dutch multidisciplinary sciatica guideline [5] recommends to integrate shared decision making (SDM) in consultations. In SDM, clinicians and the patient make decisions jointly, weighting the best available evidence regarding different treatment options [6] . Patients are encouraged to consider prolonged conservative treatment or surgery and the likely benefits and harm of each so that they communicate their preferences and help to select the best treatment for them. Only when professionals and the patient together decide on treatment (SDM), delivered care can be truly patient-centered.Despite the recommendation to integrate SDM in consultations [5] , there are strong indications that SDM is not yet adopted in clinical management of patients with sciatica. Recently, a comparison between regions in the Netherlands showed considerable variation in the number of sciatica patients that undergo surgery, ranging from 31 to 140 per 100,000 inhabitants [7] . In addition, Dutch surgery rates for sciatica patients are four times higher than in the United Kingdom and two times higher than in Sweden [7] while The United States have a 40% higher surgery rate than the Netherlands [8] . As enhancing the use of SDM was found to be associated with lower hospital admission rates through the prevention preference-sensitive surgeries [9] , its use is likely to play a role in the variation in surgery, in addition to factors such as case mix.Previous research concerning the barriers for implementation of SDM in clinical practice mainly focussed on one discipline (monodisciplinary) or on inter-professional (IP) teams [10] [11] [12] . An inter-professional approach involves separate disciplines that integrate different approaches mostly into a single consultation [13] . However, due to the increasing specialization of medical professionals, patients nowadays are treated by multiple disciplines in several separate consultations as for example in sciatica care were the general practitioner, physical therapist, neurologist and neurosurgeon or orthopedic surgeon are frequently involved. SDM in multidisciplinary care utilizes the skills and experience of professionals from different disciplines, with each discipline approaching the patient from their own perspective [13] , so that different barriers and facilitators for SDM implementation may play a role and to a different extent than in a monodisciplinary setting or in an inter-professional team. This is currently unknown. Furthermore, most studies focus on professionals only, while patients are part of the SDM process and may perceive other barriers and facilitators which may be also important for the implementation of SDM. To our knowledge, this is the first quantitative study that focuses on barriers and facilitators of SDM perceived by professionals of different disciplines as well as patients.In a previous qualitative study among patients and professionals we explored the full spectrum of barriers and facilitators related to the use of SDM in sciatica care, including those related to the multidisciplinary setting [14] . However, these qualitative data do not provide the importance of these barriers and facilitators for SDM implementation. This is needed to focus an implementation strategy towards the most important barriers and facilitators. Therefore this study aims to answer the following research questions:1. Which factors are most important for SDM implementation in multidisciplinary sciatica care? 2. Are these factors mainly a barrier or a facilitator for SDM?", "citance": "A large, randomized clinical trial showed no significant difference in clinical outcomes between conservative treatment and surgery after 1 and 2 years in patients with sciatica [3] .", "claims": [{"text": "There is no significant difference in clinical outcomes between sciatica patients who receive conservative treatment versus surgery.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses were undertaken and applied in a three-step compartmental model to estimate NDI cases after severe neonatal bacterial infection in South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America in neonates of >32 wk gestation (or >1,500 g).   METHODS We estimated cases of sepsis, meningitis, pneumonia, or no severe bacterial infection from among estimated cases of possible severe bacterial infection ((pSBI) step 1). We applied respective case fatality risks ((CFRs) step 2) and the NDI risk among survivors (step 3). For neonatal tetanus, incidence estimates were based on the estimated deaths, CFRs, and risk of subsequent NDI.   RESULTS For 2010, we estimated 1.7 million (uncertainty range: 1.1-2.4 million) cases of neonatal sepsis, 200,000 (21,000-350,000) cases of meningitis, 510,000 cases (150,000-930,000) of pneumonia, and 79,000 cases (70,000-930,000) of tetanus in neonates >32 wk gestation (or >1,500 g). Among the survivors, we estimated moderate to severe NDI after neonatal meningitis in 23% (95% confidence interval: 19-26%) of survivors, 18,000 (2,700-35,000) cases, and after neonatal tetanus in 16% (6-27%), 4,700 cases (1,700-8,900).   CONCLUSION Data are lacking for impairment after neonatal sepsis and pneumonia, especially among those of >32 wk gestation. Improved recognition and treatment of pSBI will reduce neonatal mortality. Lack of follow-up data for survivors of severe bacterial infections, particularly sepsis, was striking. Given the high incidence of sepsis, even minor NDI would be of major public health importance. Prevention of neonatal infection, improved case management, and support for children with NDI are all important strategies, currently receiving limited policy attention.", "citation_paragraph": "Articles tetanus deaths. Of these, there were an estimated 29,000 survivors (20,000-41,000). Estimates by region are presented in Table 3 .Step 3: Calculation of the Number of Impaired Survivors Impairment risk. There are very few data on impairment risk in survivors of neonatal bacterial infections. Estimates of impairment following neonatal meningitis were mainly identified from studies in high-income settings. We used eight studies, which included 451 survivors of neonatal meningitis and estimated that 23% (95% CI: 19-26%) were moderately to severely impaired (Figure 4) . For mild impairment, we used five studies (311 survivors), resulting in an estimate of 12% (95% CI: 5-19%). Specifically for hearing impairment, we identified 11 studies (442 survivors), resulting in an estimate of 7% (95% CI: 3-12%); these cases were included in the combined categories of impairment; for details, see Supplementary Information online.Estimates of impairment after neonatal tetanus came from 4 studies with 89 survivors, of whom 16% (95% CI: 6-27%) had moderate to severe impairment ( Figure 5 ). Data were even more limited for mild impairment after neonatal tetanus, with widely differing estimates. One study reported 2 of 43 survivors with mild impairment, reviewed 6 mo to 4 y after recovery (20) and another identified 5 of 10 survivors (50%) with mild impairment (21) . There was one further study from Kenya, which reported 33 neonatal survivors, 2 of whom died after the neonatal period and 10 of whom moved away (22) . One of those who died had a history compatible with severe NDI, but none of those who were able to be followed up had moderate to severe impairment, and data on mild impairment outcomes were not comparable with our definitions and thus not included in the meta-analysis. We were unable to identify sufficient data on impairment after neonatal sepsis and neonatal pneumonia to estimate the burden from these severe bacterial infections.Estimates of the number of impaired survivors of neonatal meningitis and neonatal tetanus. After neonatal meningitis (in neonates >32 wk gestation (or >1,500 g)) in 2010, there were an estimated 18,000 (uncertainty range: 2,700-35,000) moderately to severely impaired survivors and 9,200 (2,000-47,000) mildly impaired survivors. Of those with impairment, 5,600 (1,200-29,000) survivors had hearing impairment. After neonatal tetanus infection, there were an estimated 4,700 (1,700-8,900) neonatal survivors with moderate to severe impairment. Estimates by region are presented in Table 3 . discussion The estimated 6.7 million (uncertainty range: 5.4-8.1 million) cases of pSBI per year in neonates >32 wk gestation (or >1,500 g) are associated with a major burden on the health system and on health workers, with a need for antibiotic therapy, even though many do not have a final diagnosis of invasive bacterial infection (Seale et al., unpublished data). Our estimates of cases of true invasive bacterial disease are lower but still indicate a major burden from neonatal sepsis, meningitis, and pneumonia in SA, sSA, and LA. These are the first estimates of severe bacterial infections derived from the estimated incidence of pSBI and align with recent estimates of severe pneumonia in young children, which suggested 3 million cases worldwide (23) . Although no separate estimates of neonatal infections were provided in the pneumonia study, the incidence risk of admission for \"severe pneumonia\" (defined using WHO case criteria) was noted to be three times higher for neonates compared with that for all infants (0-59 mo). The burden of neonatal infections in non-preterm babies in SA, sSA, and LA is very high compared with that in babies in resource-rich regions, where the numbers of sepsis and neonatal meningitis cases are much lower but still constitute a considerable burden of disease (24) .There are limitations to these estimates and considerable uncertainty, particularly in apportioning of pSBI to the three infection syndromes (sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis), because this split is based on just one multicountry study (9) , with only two studies reporting meningitis outcomes. The young infant algorithm, which is also only 85% sensitive for pSBI, was based on those admissions, and admissions included other diagnoses such as hyperbilirubinemia, diarrhea, neonatal encephalopathy, and, in some cases, preterm birth (9) . However, the estimate of neonatal meningitis cases using facility-based data, and adjusting for care seeking, was comparable with that based on apportioning of the incidence of pSBI. The estimates for each region are based on the number of live births in 2010 (>32 wk gestation or >1,500 g) and on application of the same parameters to each region. The data did not allow region-specific incidence risks and so may be missing important regional differences in pSBI incidence and in proportions of neonatal sepsis, meningitis, and pneumonia, in addition to missing differing care-seeking behavior, treatment rates, and subsequent outcomes.The mortality burden from severe bacterial infection in neonates is well recognized (25) . However, the total neonatal deaths estimated herein (1.2 million) exceed those presented by the Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group, which total 400,000 neonatal deaths due to pneumonia and sepsis/meningitis in sSA and SA and 720,000 worldwide (1,2) . The Institute for Health Metrics Evaluation gives a similar total of 750,000 for neonatal infection deaths (26) . The methods used by both the Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group (2) and the Institute for Health Metrics Evaluation (26) examine mortality data and assign a proportion of deaths to a specific cause are based on many more input data and are likely more robust. The estimates here may be higher because of assumptions in careseeking behavior (that 41% did not seek care, based on a published meta-analysis (19) ) and the high CFR (95%) applied to those with sepsis, meningitis, or pneumonia who did not seek care. The published estimate that 41% do not seek care is based on limited data (22 studies, 17 of which were from SA (19) ) and was applied in our model for all regions. For those who do seek care, CFRs are well known to be problematic in burden estimation work, because they are rarely population based, and tend to miss the mildest cases, resulting in an overestimate of mortality (27) . Importantly, the Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group and the Institute for Health Metrics Evaluation estimates differ in the proportional split of deaths attributed to pneumonia vs. sepsis/meningitis, with more deaths attributed to pneumonia in the Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group, underlining the greater uncertainty in attributed syndromespecific diagnoses based primarily on clinical symptoms that usually overlap in neonates.The calculation of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) requires estimates of survivors of the specific condition (e.g., neonatal sepsis), the excess mortality in postneonatal survivors of the condition, and a disability weight for the condition. Neonatal survivors of meningitis, sepsis, pneumonia, and tetanus may have increased rates of mortality in infancy, childhood, and later adult life, associated with disability. Due to the limitations and uncertainty in our estimates of neonatal survivors and expected excess mortality, apart from the lack of disability weights for the specific neonatal infections in the recent GBD2010 estimates, DALYs were not able to be calculated here. The DALYs presented in Table 3 are therefore those published in the GBD2010 estimates (5).Estimates for NDI are limited by lack of data on impairment after neonatal sepsis and neonatal pneumonia. However, the burden of NDI from neonatal meningitis is high, with a third of all survivors impaired (Figure 6 ). Our estimate of the risk of moderate to severe NDI (23%; 95% CI: 19-26%) is higher than the previously published estimate of NDI after childhood meningitis (12.8%; 95% CI: 7.2-21.1%) (6) . This is to be expected because etiology varies with age and infection during Beyond survival: neonatal infections Articles brain development increases the likelihood of NDI after neonatal meningitis, compared with the same for childhood meningitis. Although the risk of impairment from neonatal infection is strongly associated with decreasing gestational age, impairment outcomes after Group B Streptococcus meningitis still show a high (19%) burden of severe impairment in term infants in resource-rich countries in a recent study (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) from two hospitals in the United States (28) .In terms of neonatal tetanus, although our estimate of 4,700 cases (uncertainty range: 1,700-8,900) of moderate to severe NDI is a comparatively small number, and progress has been made in reducing neonatal tetanus incidence, it must be remembered that this is an entirely preventable disease. In this case, therefore, the challenge is to improve prevention, through immunization, to prevent all these cases (11).", "citance": "These are the first estimates of severe bacterial infections derived from the estimated incidence of pSBI and align with recent estimates of severe pneumonia in young children, which suggested 3 million cases worldwide (23) .", "claims": [{"text": "There was an estimated 3 million cases of pneumonia in young children worldwide in 2010.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "There was an estimated 30 million cases of pneumonia in young children worldwide in 2010.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}

However, an increasing number of studies reveal that the impact of the PAH reaches further than the pulmonary circulation. Striated muscles other than the right ventricle are affected in PAH, such as the left ventricle, the diaphragm and peripheral skeletal muscles. Alterations in these striated muscles are associated with exercise intolerance and reduced quality of life. In this Back to Basics article on striated muscle function in PAH, we provide insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms causing muscle dysfunction in PAH and discuss potential new therapeutic strategies to restore muscle dysfunction.", "citation_paragraph": "Calcium sensitisers are small-molecule drugs that slow the dissociation of calcium from the troponin complex, thereby stabilising the open conformation of the troponin/tropomyosin complex to enhance cross-bridge formation. Currently, levosimendan is the only clinically available calcium sensitiser. However, levosimendan targets slow-twitch muscle fibres and also affects cardiac muscle [83, 84] . As calcium sensitivity in the ventricles is already increased in PAH patients, contributing to diastolic dysfunction, it could be detrimental for the heart to increase calcium sensitivity even further. Tirasemtiv is a novel calcium sensitiser that is currently in a phase 2B clinical trial. It specifically targets fast-twitch muscle fibres and has no effect on cardiac muscle [85] . As smooth muscle cells do not contain troponin, it also has no effect on the pulmonary vasculature. An analogue of Tirasemtiv was tested on single permeabilised muscle fibres of the diaphragm of PAH patients. It greatly improved submaximal force generation of fast-twitch muscle fibres [50] . Besides improving submaximal force generation, calcium sensitisers might also be energetically beneficial, as less calcium is needed for a certain force response. Reuptake of calcium from the cytoplasm into the SR during relaxation is a highly energy-consuming process. It was shown that neuromechanical efficiency improved by 21% in the diaphragm of healthy controls after acute supplementation of a calcium sensitiser [86] .In summary, ExT including IMT could be beneficial for both cardiac and skeletal muscle function.

As MDS and AML are considered to originate from genetic and molecular defects of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC), the main focus of research in this field has focused on the characterization of these cells. Recently, the contribution of BM microenvironment to the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies, in particular MDS and AML has gained more interest. This is based on a better understanding of its physiological role in the regulation of hematopoiesis. Additionally, it was demonstrated as a 'proof of principle' that genetic disruption of cells of the mesenchymal or osteoblastic lineage can induce MDS, MPS or AML in mice. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about the contribution of the BM microenvironment, in particular mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) to the pathogenesis of AML and MDS. Furthermore, potential models integrating the BM microenvironment into the pathophysiology of these myeloid disorders are discussed. Finally, strategies to therapeutically exploit this knowledge and to interfere with the crosstalk between clonal hematopoietic cells and altered stem cell niches are introduced.", "citation_paragraph": "Taking into account the physiological relevance of the BM microenvironment, several investigators have tested the hypothesis if genetic alterations of niche cells are capable of inducing myeloid malignancies. This idea challenges the well-accepted concept that MDS and AML originate exclusively from HSPC-intrinsic genetic defects.First evidence for niche-driven myeloid disorders came from a series of murine experiments with deletions of the Retinoblastoma gene, the retinoic acid receptor gamma (RAR-\u03b3), I\u03baB\u03b1 or the Notch ligand endocytosis regulator Mib1 [16] [17] [18] [19] . In all experimental systems, mice developed a myeloproliferative disease phenotype characterized by leukocytosis, extramedullary hematopoiesis and splenomegaly. These studies highlighted that genetic changes of non-hematopoietic elements of the BM microenvironment can directly contribute to disease initiation. Still, in some of these experiments, simultaneous deletion of the candidate gene in hematopoietic and surrounding cells was required thus preventing to dissect the cell subset responsible for the myeloproliferative phenotype.Two subsequent studies refined this concept and by specific genetic manipulation of specific stromal cells subsets, they pointed towards a pivotal role of MSC and osteoblasts for the pathogenesis of MDS and AML. In a first sophisticated model reported by Raaijmakers et al. [20] , genetic ablation of the RNAse III endonuclease Dicer1 in mesenchymal/osteoprogenitor cells resulted in a MDS phenotype associated with acquisition of genetic alterations and a propensity to develop AML. In this model, loss of Dicer1 resulted in a lower expression of the SBDS gene, which is involved in ribosomal maturation and mutation in human Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome (SBDS), a congenital BM failure disorder associated with leukemic predisposition. Of particular interest, reduced expression of Dicer1 and the SBDS gene has also been described in MSC from patients with MDS suggesting that some pathophysiological aspects from murine experiments maybe also apply to human MDS [21] [22] [23] . In a recent study by Zambetti et al. [24] , there was a further support of the theory that the stromal compartment is actively involved in the initiation and propagation of myeloid diseases. Here, deletion of the SBDS gene again in mesenchymal progenitor cells induced mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative and genotoxic stress in HSPC. This direct link between a stromal defect and subsequent disturbances of HSPC functionality was mechanistically mediated by damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecules S100A8 and S100A9, which were secreted from mesenchymal niche cells. Potentially relating this finding also to human MDS pathogenesis, the authors detected a significant association with between the expression of S100A8 and S100A9 and the likelihood of AML transformation in 45 patients with low-risk MDS. Furthermore, the role of the innate immune toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling in the pathogenesis of human MDS has just recently been described by two other groups [25] [26] [27] .In a second model, constitutively active \u03b2-catenin and subsequent Wnt signaling in osteoblasts caused a transplantable AML phenotype [28] . These changes were induced by the expression of Jagged-1 in niche cells and consequently activation of Notch signaling in hematopoietic cells. Again, translating this into humans, these authors found increased nuclear \u03b2-catenin in osteoblastic cells and increased Notch activity in HSPC of 38% of patients with AML or MDS. Consistent with this, we also previously reported on the increased expression of Jagged-1 on MSC derived from patients with MDS and AML [21, 29] .", "citance": "Furthermore, the role of the innate immune toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling in the pathogenesis of human MDS has just recently been described by two other groups [25] [26] [27] .In a second model, constitutively active \u03b2-catenin and subsequent Wnt signaling in osteoblasts caused a transplantable AML phenotype [28] .", "claims": [{"text": "Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling is involved in the pathogenesis of human MDS.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Recently, gut microbiome-host relations have been implicated in cardiovascular disease and associated metabolic conditions; therefore, gut microbiota may be key mediators or modulators driving the observed sexual dimorphism in disease onset and progression. While current evidence regarding pure physiological sex differences in gut microbiome composition is modest, robust research suggests that gut microbiome-dependent metabolites may interact with important biological pathways under sex hormone control, including toll-like receptor and flavin monooxygenase signaling. Here, we review key sex differences in gut microbiome interactions with four primary determinants of cardiovascular disease, impaired glucose regulation, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and obesity. Through this process, we propose important sex differences in downstream metabolic pathways that may be at the interface of the gut microbiome and cardiovascular disease.", "citation_paragraph": "Gut microbiome dysbiosis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of type II diabetes [41] . Individuals with type II diabetes have both functional and compositional gut microbiota differences compared to those without disease [58] . Transfer of fecal microbiota from healthy human hosts to individuals with metabolic syndrome has increased gut microbial diversity and improved insulin sensitivity [59] . Such evidence demonstrates a role for the gut microbiome in the development of glycemic dysregulation and type II diabetes; however, mechanistic pathways and sex-specific pathophysiology remain to be elucidated.Among the number of mechanisms by which gut dysbiosis could contribute to insulin resistance, one primary means may be through systemic low-grade inflammation [60] . Inflammation can disrupt insulin sensitivity via TLR signaling cascades. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) knockout mice exhibit insulin resistance and glucose intolerance associated with key modifications in intestinal microbiota, including higher proportions of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes coupled with a lower proportion of Proteobacteria phyla [46] . Insulin resistance associated with absent TLR2 signaling may be attributed to increased serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in the muscle, liver, and adipose tissue [61] . Sex-specific expression and signaling through both TLR2 and TLR4 have been reported [62] , particularly through sex hormones. Testosterone decreases TLR4 expression in macrophages [63] , and exogenous estrogen treatment in mice increases cell membrane expression of TLR4 [64] , while progesterone diminishes LPS-mediated TLR4 signaling [65] . Therefore, although no studies have specifically examined the potential modifying effects of sex on the relationship between the gut microbiome and insulin resistance, sexspecific activation of inflammatory pathways is an important area for future research.The relationship between the gut microbiome and insulin sensitivity may be modified by the serum metabolome. Serum triglycerides [66] , membrane phospholipids [67] , and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) [68] are associated with insulin resistance and type II diabetes. Gut microbiota are intricately involved in metabolite biochemical pathways, helping synthesize vitamins, SCFAs, and amino acids, but also facilitate bile acid transformation and hydrolysis of non-digestible molecules [69] . In one study of 300 Danish individuals, insulin resistance was characterized by high serum concentrations of BCAAs and high proportions of gut microbiota Prevotella copri and Bacteroides vulgatus species, which have a high biosynthetic potential for producing BCAAs [70] . Notably, sex differences have been reported in BCAA and related degradation product metabolism, with men exhibiting higher serum metabolome concentrations of BCAA compared to metabolically similar women [71] . These findings are in line with data demonstrating that the Bacteroides-Prevotella groups are more prevalent in men compared to women [30] . In an animal model, female rats have more pronounced diurnal variation in hepatic branched-chain 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase (BCODH) activity, with over a twofold increase in morning expression of BCODH compared to male rats [72] . BCODH facilitates the catabolism of circulating BCAAs. Female sex hormones may be responsible for BCODH diurnal variation, as gonadectomy inhibits diurnal variation in female but not male rats [72] . Given that higher serum BCAA concentrations confer increased risk for glucose abnormalities [68, 73] , female sex hormone regulation of BCODH may confer a protective effect for insulin resistance and type II diabetes.", "citance": "Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) knockout mice exhibit insulin resistance and glucose intolerance associated with key modifications in intestinal microbiota, including higher proportions of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes coupled with a lower proportion of Proteobacteria phyla [46] .", "claims": [{"text": "Toll-like receptor 2 knockout mice show glucose intolerance associated with higher proportions of Bacteriodetes and Firmicutes and lower proportion of Proteobacteria phyla compared to wild type mice.

Here, we describe a novel CAR-T cell platform that utilizes expression of the toll-like receptor (TLR) adaptor molecule, MyD88, and tumor-necrosis factor family member, CD40 (MC), tethered to the CAR molecule through an intentionally inefficient 2A linker system, providing a constitutive signal that drives CAR-T survival, proliferation, and antitumor activity against CD19+ and CD123+ hematological cancers. Robust activity of MC-enhanced CAR-T cells was associated with cachexia in animal models that corresponded with high levels of human cytokine production. However, toxicity could be successfully resolved by using the inducible caspase-9 (iC9) safety switch to reduce serum cytokines, by administration of a neutralizing antibody against TNF-\u03b1, or by selecting \u201clow\u201d cytokine-producing CD8+ T cells, without loss of antitumor activity. Interestingly, high basal activity was essential for in vivo CAR-T expansion. This study shows that co-opting novel signaling elements (i.e., MyD88 and CD40) and development of a unique CAR-T architecture can drive T-cell proliferation in vivo to enhance CAR-T therapies.", "citation_paragraph": "This study describes an empirically discovered CAR architecture that utilizes high basal CAR signaling and costimulation (i.e., \"always on\") to drive T-cell proliferation and potent antitumor activity against aggressive CD19 + and CD123 + lymphoma and leukemia cell lines. While CAR-T cells expressing constitutively active MC produced high cytokine levels that could cause toxicity (i.e., IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6), activating iC9 with rimiducid quickly and effectively resolved this toxicity in animal models. Importantly, rimiducid could be titrated to \"partially\" eliminate iC9-expressing CAR-T cells, preserving long-term antitumor efficacy. In addition, using neutralizing antibodies, we elucidated that CAR-T cell-secreted cytokines were responsible for the observed cachexia. This finding led to the selection and infusion of enriched CD8 + effector T cells with lower cytokine secretion, which resulted in lower toxicity with increased antitumor effects in a CD4 + helperindependent manner. Initially, we attempted to express MC in cis with CD3\u03b6, analogous to conventional CAR designs that rely on wellcharacterized costimulatory domains, such as CD28 and 4-1BB. However, MyD88 appeared to destabilize the CAR, lowering surface expression and decreasing in vivo antitumor activity (Fig. 1) . Therefore, we subsequently attempted to express MC as a freestanding protein to provide continuous costimulation to CD19-specific CAR-T cells. This resulted in the restoration of CAR surface expression on modified T cells and improved antitumor activity (Fig. 2) . Western blot analyses revealed additional sub-molar MC species indicative of the formation of fusion proteins, potentially caused by inefficient 2A-mediated peptide bond skipping between CAR.\u03b6 and the MC molecule. We hypothesize that ligation of MC to a fraction of membrane-localized CAR molecules induces a signaling cascade that is responsible for basal activity but leaves enough unmodified CAR present to maintain CAR surface levels and potency. Indeed, the addition of a small GSG linker to the 5\u2032 end of the 2A peptide to increase transgene protein separation curtails basal cytokine secretion and abolishes in vivo CAR-T cell proliferation (Fig. 6) . Tethered to CD3\u03b6, MyD88/CD40 may act as a scaffold to recruit other signaling proteins (e.g., interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) family) as a MyDDosome complex to induce basal signaling [19] [20] [21] [22] . Alternatively, tonic signaling from the scFv, amplified by MyD88/CD40, could result in constitutive stimulation [23] . However, since the scFv tested in most of our studies, FMC63, is not associated with high tonic signaling, simple membrane localization of MC is the more likely explanation consistent with the comparable activity triggered by MC myristoylation (Fig. 6a, b) .Unlike previous reports of the deleterious effects of constitutive CAR signaling, MC costimulation did not appear to induce CAR-T cell exhaustion [23, 24] . Indeed, MC-enabled CAR-T cells could proliferate for more than 3 months without loss of cytotoxic function, IL-2 production, and importantly, responsiveness to iC9-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 2e-g ). Long et al. showed that some CAR costimulatory domains, such as 4-1BB, were protective against cellular exhaustion derived from tonic signaling [23] . Others have shown, however, that 4-1BB can contribute to FAS-dependent cell death under tonic CAR conditions [25] . In contrast, MC appears to phosphorylate a broad and unique set of signaling pathways [5] . In addition to signaling through NF-\u03baB [5, 6] , MC activates Akt, which has been shown to enhance survival and proliferation of CAR-T cells [26] . Additional signaling nodes (e.g., AP-1, MAPK, and IRF) may also contribute to enhanced function. Our ( Supplementary Fig. 3 and [5] ) and other's observations [6] suggest that MyD88/CD40-derived costimulation may be a more potent driver of CAR-T cell activity than CD28 or 4-1BB. Whether MyD88/CD40 overcomes the limitations of conventional costimulatory molecules in T cells expressing constitutively active CARs will be a topic of further investigation.Highly active T-cell therapies are a risk for cytokinerelated toxicities, which can be amplified further in patients with high tumor burden [27] . In this study, constitutive MC signaling in CAR-T cells resulted in acute cachexia following infusion, which was neither specific to the CAR target (i.e., CD19 or CD123) nor in the longer time frame typically seen with xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease. However, toxicity could be mitigated by activation of iC9 following a single rimiducid injection. As previously demonstrated, rimiducid titration resulted in partial elimination of MC-enabled CAR-T cells, without loss of antitumor activity [16] . Use of neutralizing blocking antibodies revealed that blockade of TNF-\u03b1 decreased CAR-T cellrelated toxicity, suggesting that depletion of cell subsets that produce high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., CD4 + T helper cells) could improve the therapeutic window for using a constitutive, MC-enabled CAR-T cell therapy. Indeed, purification of CD8 + T cells resulted in improved efficacy with minimal cytokine-related toxicity that did not require the use of rimiducid to mitigate toxicity. Interestingly, MC appeared to support the expansion of CAR-T cells in a CD4 + helper-independent manner, suggesting that in clinical application, purification of CD8 + T cells might decrease CRS independent of the inclusion of putative regulatory CAR-T cells [28] . Since the animal models used in this study lacked human-derived myeloid cells, further investigation of iC9-CD19.\u03b6-MC CAR-T cells using recently described preclinical models of CRS would yield additional translational insight [29, 30] . In summary, constitutive MC costimulation provides CARs targeting CD19 or CD123 with long-term proliferative potential and high antitumor efficacy in animal models of lymphoma and myeloid leukemias, respectively.MC-enabled CAR-T cells exhibit substantial basal activity and are associated with cytokine-related toxicities in immune-deficient mice, but this can be managed by deployment of the iC9 safety switch with rimiducid, selective blockade of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1), or by selecting T-cell subsets (CD8 + ) with the propensity for lower cytokine secretion. Overall, we identified a novel, highly efficacious CAR-T platform.", "citance": "Alternatively, tonic signaling from the scFv, amplified by MyD88/CD40, could result in constitutive stimulation [23] .", "claims": [{"text": "Tonic signaling from the scFv induces constitutive stimulation.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Tonic signaling from the scFv is amplified by MyD88/CD40.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Tonic signaling from the scFv is repressed by MyD88/CD40.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Tonic signaling from the scFv prevents constitutive stimulation.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}

Searches were performed in Embase, MEDLINE and Pubmed up to November 2015. Screening of titles, abstracts and full papers was performed by two independent reviewers. Data extraction and validity were performed by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. Study quality was assessed using the SYRCLE risk of bias tool, for animal studies and by developing validity tools for the experimental model, organelle markers and imprecision. A narrative data synthesis was performed. We identified 31 studies (34 publications) of the asymmetric inheritance of organelles after mitotic or meiotic division. Studies for the asymmetric inheritance of centrosomes (n = 9); endosomes (n = 6), P granules (n = 4), the midbody (n = 3), mitochondria (n = 3), proteosomes (n = 2), spectrosomes (n = 2), cilia (n = 2) and endoplasmic reticulum (n = 2) were identified. Asymmetry was defined and quantified by variable methods. Assessment of the statistical reliability of the results indicated only two studies (7%) were judged to have low concern, the majority of studies (77%) were 'unclear' and five (16%) were judged to have 'high concerns'; the main reasons were low technical repeats (<10). Assessment of model validity indicated that the majority of studies (61%) were judged to be valid, ten studies (32%) were unclear and two studies (7%) were judged to have 'high concerns'; both described 'stem cells' without providing experimental evidence to confirm this (pluripotency and self-renewal). Assessment of marker validity indicated that no studies had low concern, most studies were unclear (96.5%), indicating there were insufficient details to judge if the markers were appropriate. One study had high concern for marker validity due to the contradictory results of two markers for the same organelle. For most studies the validity and imprecision of results could not be confirmed. In particular, data were limited due to a lack of reporting of interassay variability, sample size calculations, controls and functional validation of organelle markers. An evaluation of 16 systematic reviews containing cell assays found that only 50% reported adherence to PRISMA or ARRIVE reporting guidelines and 38% reported a formal risk of bias assessment. 44% of the reviews did not consider how relevant or valid the models were to the research question. 75% reviews did not consider how valid the markers were. 69% of reviews did not consider the impact of the statistical reliability of the results. Future systematic reviews in basic or preclinical research should ensure the rigorous reporting of the statistical reliability of the results in addition to the validity of the methods. Increased awareness of the importance of reporting guidelines and validation tools is needed for the scientific community.", "citation_paragraph": "A systematic review uses transparent and systematic methods to minimise bias and random error. It seeks to combine the results from multiple studies to generate a more powerful, overall finding about the effectiveness of a technology or evidence under investigation. Systematic reviews have been used predominantly for clinical research, but it is possible to conduct a review in any field, or in any topic, by synthesising different types of evidence. Systematic review techniques are rigorous, to minimise bias, and include a critical appraisal of the quality of the evidence. Traditional reviews often include a range of sources of potential bias including: failure to clearly state the review question, no attempt to identify all relevant literature, poor explanation of the inclusion and exclusion of evidence, lack of consideration of study methods or quality, and typically are conducted by a single reviewer with a professional interest in the field [1] . Bias is a systematic error, usually due to an issue with study design, such that repetition of the same experiment would still give the wrong answer. Imprecision is the random error, repetition of the result will reduce sampling error, therefore larger studies are more precise.The use of systematic reviews within basic research is not commonly performed. In recent years there have been systematic reviews of preclinical, animal-based studies. These reviews have led to the establishment of CAMARADES (Collaborative Approach to Meta-Analysis and Review of Animal Data from Experimental Studies; http://www.dcn.ed.ac.uk/camarades/ default.htm), the development of the ARRIVE reporting guidelines for in vivo studies [2] , and the SYRCLE risk of bias tool [3] . Systematic reviews for basic science offer the same advantages as for those carried out for preclinical animal studies: to statistically combine the results of a number of similar studies, to provide more reliable results upon which to base decisions (scientific rather than subjective), to identify evidence gaps, to allow an evidence based translation of basic science to the clinic, and to improve the validation of basic research by identifying results within multiple model systems [4] .The authors of this review have published on the fate and differentiation of human prostate stem cells [5] [6] [7] [8] , as well as performing clinical systematic reviews [9] [10] [11] [12] . Stem cell research is of great biomedical interest and stem cell therapies are a growing area of research, although the basic biology is not well understood. Whilst performing cell tracking experiments, we observed the asymmetric inheritance of a fluorescent lipid soluble dye known as PKH26 [5, 6] . Many groups have observed that PKH26 becomes internalised into the endocytic pathway [13] , which led us to postulate that we had witnessed early asymmetric inheritance of lipid membrane organelles. We decided to perform a systematic review to establish what evidence exists for the asymmetric inheritance of any eukaryotic organelle after cell division, and specifically to identify if this can occur in stem cells or human cells. We discovered that existing risk of bias tools were not appropriate for cell based studies. Therefore, we produced validity tools to assess: a) the model, b) the marker and c) the imprecision of the result.

The system is based on the chimeric transcriptional activator Gal4dbd.ER.VP16 (GEV). Upon addition of the hormone \u03b2-estradiol, cytoplasmic GEV localizes to the nucleus and binds to promoters containing Gal4p consensus binding sequences to activate transcription. With galactokinase Gal1p and transcriptional activator Gal4p absent, the system is fast-acting, resulting in readily detectable transcription within 5 min after addition of the inducer. \u03b2-Estradiol is nearly a gratuitous inducer, as indicated by genome-wide profiling that shows unintended induction (by GEV) of only a few dozen genes. Response to inducer is graded: intermediate concentrations of inducer result in production of intermediate levels of product protein in all cells. We present data illustrating several applications of this system, including a modification of the regulated degron method, which allows rapid and specific degradation of a specific protein upon addition of \u03b2-estradiol. These gene induction and protein degradation systems provide important tools for studying the dynamics and functional relationships of genes and their respective regulatory networks.", "citation_paragraph": "The data presented show that the GEV system, as we configured it, satisfies the requirements of an effective and nearly gratuitous induction system. It can be used to rapidly induce a target gene in every cell in a culture while conferring minimal induction of off-target genes. GEV provides efficient induction. Transcription rates in S. cerevisiae measured in the literature range from 0.7 to 2 kb/min (Mason and Struhl, 2005; Zenklusen et al., 2008) , the upper bound of which has been measured from a P GAL1 -driven gene (Mason and Struhl, 2005) . If a gene is 2 kb in length and is downstream of P GAL1 , as in the case of P GAL1 -MET4, generating a full transcript should take 1 min. By 2.5 min, we observed detectable amounts of P GAL1 -driven transcript (Supplemental Figure 2) . By 2.5 min, therefore, the gene has gone through several rounds of transcription. By 5 min, the amount of induction is near-maximal.In our localization experiments, we detect GEV-GFP in the nucleus at 6-8 min following addition of \u03b2-estradiol to the media. If nuclear localization takes 6-8 min, how do we measure full-length transcripts at 2.5 min following \u03b2-estradiol to the medium? There are at least two potential explanations. First, the GEV-GFP fusion may have slightly slower kinetics of nuclear localization than GEV. Second, the kinetics of GEV-GFP reflects that of GEV without the fluorescent tag, but measuring localization is too insensitive to detect the first few GEV-GFP molecules that become localized to the nucleus and activate transcription.", "citance": "Transcription rates in S. cerevisiae measured in the literature range from 0.7 to 2 kb/min (Mason and Struhl, 2005; Zenklusen et al., 2008) , the upper bound of which has been measured from a P GAL1 -driven gene (Mason and Struhl, 2005) .", "claims": [{"text": "Transcription rates in S. cerevisiae range between 0.7 and 2 kb/min.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Transcription rates in S. cerevisiae range between 7 and 12 kb/min.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}
{"s2orc_id": 23704453, "title": "Reconstitution of adaptive immunity after umbilical cord blood transplantation: impact on infectious complications.", "abstract": "In comparison with allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) with other stem cell sources, umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) was traditionally associated with increased risk of infections, particularly during the first 3 months after transplantation. Longitudinal studies of immune monitoring reported peculiar patterns of T- and B-cell recovery in the peripheral blood of UCB recipients during the first months post-transplantation. Overall, current data suggest delayed reconstitution of naive and memory CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell pools after UCBT. This is particularly true for adult recipients and for patients who received in vivo T-cell depleting approaches before the transplantation. Such delayed T-cell recovery may increase susceptibility of UCB recipients for developing opportunistic infections and viral reactivations. Regarding B-cell recovery, UCBT was associated with accelerated B-lymphopoiesis. Recent studies also reported evidence for faster functional memory B-cell recovery in UCB recipients. In this article, we briefly review T- and B-cell reconstitution after alloHSCT, with emphasis on peculiarities observed after UCBT. We further put these data in lines with risks of infections after UCBT.", "citation_paragraph": "Several studies compared T-cell recovery after UCBT versus BM or PBSC alloHSCT ( Table 1 ) (42) (43) (44) (45) (46) (47) (48) (49) (50) . Although highly variable in the population they investigated (pediatric versus adult patients, transplantation with either single or double UCB units, HLA-matched or mismatched PBSC-or BM-recipients as control groups, myeloablative or reduced intensity conditioning regimens, and variable GVHD prophylaxes, specifically with the use or not of ATG), the majority of them reported delayed T-cell recovery in UCBT patients (42) (43) (44) (45) (48) (49) (50) . Depending on the study, lower counts of circulating T cells in the peripheral blood were observed up to 3-12 months after UCBT, as compared with alloHSCT with PBSC or BM. Delayed CD8 + T-cell recovery was almost consistently described, whilst delayed CD4 + T-cell recovery was reported by some groups (43) (44) (45) 48, 50) but not all (42, 49) . In a number of these studies, pre-transplant ATG was administered more frequently in UCB-recipients than in patients receiving other graft source (42) (43) (44) 49, 50) . In addition, conditioning regimen and GVHD prophylaxis often differed between patients transplanted with UCB and PBSC or BM. These variables have to be taken into consideration when interpreting the results of these studies, as they can be important confounding factors.As an example, prompter CD4 + T-cell reconstitution was indeed observed after UCBT with the omission of ATG (51, 52) . However, recent studies having monitored immune recovery after \"ATG-free\" myeloablative double UCBT versus PBSC-alloHSCT in adult patients still reported a transient 3-month delay in T-cell reconstitution in UCB recipients (45, 48) .Whether delayed T-cell recovery after UCBT is related to graft-intrinsic or extrinsic factors (such as specific conditioning and prophylaxis regimens) are not formally known. However, in comparison with PBSC and BM harvests, UCB grafts are characterized by quantitative and qualitative differences in their composition that may predict potential impact on both thymic-independent and thymicdependent T-cell recovery ( Figure 1 ). This will be discussed in the following paragraphs.Current knowledge about the thymic-independent pathway of T-cell reconstitution after UCBT Considering T-cell reconstitution through the thymicindependent pathway, an important limiting factor can be the relatively low dose of T cells contained in one UCB unit (about 1-2 log fewer than BM and PBSC grafts, respectively). This results in lower amount of T cells transferred with the graft that can further undergo peripheral expansion. Moreover, the vast majority of UCBderived T cells are antigen-inexperienced naive T cells, which are less prone to undergo massive homeostatic proliferation, specifically in an HLA-mismatched transplant setting (that is common in UCBT) (see above). Taken together, these data suggest lower potential for T-cell recovery through the thymic-independent pathway after UCBT. Additionally, since UCB does not contain anti-pathogen experienced memory T cells, there is no possibility for direct transfer of protective T-cell memory immunity from the donor to the host after UCBT.Faster increase in T cell numbers was observed after double UCBT, in comparison with single UCBT. Although this might simply be related to the higher dose of transferred T cells, frequent HLA mismatches between UCB units in double UCBT might also trigger the expansion of T cells through graft-versus-graft interactions. Hence, it was reported that T cells originating from the predominant UCB unit and recognizing mismatched HLAalleles expressed by the non-engrafting UCB unit rapidly expanded after double UCBT (53) .Although UCB grafts contain high proportions of naive T cells, low count and low frequency of phenotypically naive (CD45RA + CCR7 + ) T lymphocytes were reported to circulate in the recipient's peripheral blood after UCBT, even early after transplantation (44, 48, 49, 54, 55 (49, 54, 55) .Contrarily to the memory CD8 + T-cell biased homeostatic peripheral expansion that occurs after PBSCand BM-alloHSCT, some authors recently reported a unique CD4 + -biased pattern of thymic-dependent T-cell reconstitution after UCBT with the omission of ATG (52) . One hypothesis is that fetal naive CD4 + T cells may display higher proliferative response compared to adult T cells, AlloHSCT indicates allogeneic stem cell transplantation; ATG, anti-thymocyte globulin; BM, bone marrow; Cond, conditioning regimen; dUCB, double units umbilical cord blood; MAC, myeloablative conditioning; PBSC, peripheral blood stem cells; RIC, reduced intensity conditioning; sUCB, single unit umbilical cord blood. ?, not specified.likely due to ontological properties (originating from fetal stem cells rather than adult stem cells) (18, 57) . Although rapidly acquiring a memory-like phenotype in the recipient, transferred UCB T cells maintain high TCR diversity after transplantation (58) . Fetal peripheral blood is characterized by a complete TCR repertoire at birth (59) and, in comparison with PBSC or BM harvests from adult donors, UCB grafts display larger T-cell polyclonality that reflects the lack of prior antigen stimulation. Using nextgeneration sequencing assays, van Heijst et al. reported that UCBT (double units, without ATG) was associated with a more diversified TCR repertoire at 6 and 12 months after transplantation, in comparison with conventional and T-cell depleted PBSC-alloHSCT (58). The difference was more pronounced for the CD4 + than for the CD8 + T-cell compartment, in accordance with data having shown that there is a substantially greater TCR diversity in CD4 + compared to CD8 + T cells (40, 58, 60) and that lymphocyte recovery is CD4 + -biased after UCBT (52) . To the contrary, the group of Kanda et al. described similar TCR repertoire entropy at 12 months after UCBT and T-cell repleted PBSC-alloHSCT (45) . However, the late time-point they analysed might have explained their observation. In fact, in the study of van Heijst et al., TCR diversity in non-UCB recipients improved by 12 months (likely due to appearance of naive T cells coming from de novo thymopoiesis) and approached that of UCB patients at that time point (58) .", "citance": "Although rapidly acquiring a memory-like phenotype in the recipient, transferred UCB T cells maintain high TCR diversity after transplantation (58) .", "claims": [{"text": "Transferred UCB T cells acquire a memory-like phenotype in recipients.", "subject": "UCB T cells", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "UCB T cells maintain high TCR diversity after transplantation.", "subject": "UCB T cells", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "UCB T cells reduce TCR diversity after transplantation.", "subject": "UCB T cells", "is_negation": true}]}
{"s2orc_id": 53037845, "title": "Paracrine costimulation of IFN-\u03b3 signaling by integrins modulates CD8 T cell differentiation.", "abstract": "The cytokine IFN-\u03b3 is a critical regulator of immune system development and function. Almost all leukocytes express the receptor for IFN-\u03b3, yet each cell type elicits a different response to this cytokine. Cell type-specific effects of IFN-\u03b3 make it difficult to predict the outcomes of the systemic IFN-\u03b3 blockade and limit its clinical application, despite many years of research. To better understand the cell-cell interactions and cofactors that specify IFN-\u03b3 functions, we focused on the function of IFN-\u03b3 on CD8 T cell differentiation. We demonstrated that during bacterial infection, IFN-\u03b3 is a dominant paracrine trigger that skews CD8 T cell differentiation toward memory. This skewing is preferentially driven by contact-dependent T cell-T cell (T-T) interactions and the localized IFN-\u03b3 secretion among activated CD8 T cells in a unique splenic microenvironment, and is less sensitive to concurrent IFN-\u03b3 production by other immune cell populations such as natural killer (NK) cells. Modulation of CD8 T cell differentiation by IFN-\u03b3 relies on a nonconventional IFN-\u03b3 outcome that occurs specifically within 24 hours following infection. This is driven by IFN-\u03b3 costimulation by integrins at T-T synapses, and leads to synergistic phosphorylation of the proximal STAT1 molecule and accelerated IL-2 receptor down-regulation. This study provides evidence of the importance of context-dependent cytokine signaling and gives another example of how cell clusters and the microenvironment drive unique biology.", "citation_paragraph": "To conclude, we provide evidence of context-dependent IFN-\u03b3 signaling resulting in control of the balance between effector and memory CD8 T cell differentiation. We demonstrated that early IFN-\u03b3 production by CD8 T cells acts in a paracrine manner to limit effector CD8 T cell differentiation, and relies on coengagement with integrins. The costimulation of IFN-\u03b3 by integrins at T-T synapses results in enhanced Stat1 phosphorylation, and is required in vivo for controlling CD8 T cell fate. Altogether, our data argue that coengagement of IFN-\u03b3R and integrins at T-T synapses results in enhanced IFN-\u03b3 signaling. Although we do not know whether additional factors are required for signal integration, the fact that IFN-\u03b3R must be recruited to lipid nanodomains to elicit signaling (43) raises the possibility that in activated CD8 T cells, integrins recruit IFN-\u03b3R to specific lipid nanodomains at T-T synapses, enabling distinct downstream events. Consistent with this, we noted that conditions that could restrict plasma membrane \"fluidity,\" such as coating IFN-\u03b3 on beads or inserting lipid-DNA oligos in the plasma membrane, resulted in inhibition of integrin-mediated sensitivity to IFN-\u03b3, as analyzed by EC 50 , but did not have a major effect on the increased amplitude of IFN-\u03b3 signaling. We speculate that this reflects the fact that reorganization of proteins at the plasma membrane is important for integrin-enhanced sensitivity to IFN-\u03b3. Alternately, this could also reflect a requirement of endocytosis of the IFN-\u03b3R/IFN-\u03b3 complex.How IFN-\u03b3 regulates CD25 down-regulation is unclear. The fact that we observe a lag of 4 d between IFN-\u03b3 secretion and CD25 down-regulation suggests that IFN-\u03b3 does not directly regulate CD25 expression. Alternately, it has recently been shown that transient IFN-\u03b3 exposure elicits long-lived inflammatory responses in cancer cells due to IFN-\u03b3 retention by phosphatidylserine (PS) on the surface of viable cells (44) . As TCR activation induces PS exposure at the surface of T cells (45) , a similar mechanism could lead to long-term exposure of T cells to IFN-\u03b3.IFN-\u03b3 is typically associated with proinflammatory processes, but it also has regulatory properties (46) . Our data provide another example where IFN-\u03b3 can be considered as regulating inflammation, as it counteracts prolonged CD25 expression known to be potentiated by inflammatory cytokines (30, 32) . The balance between the proinflammatory and antiinflammatory properties of IFN-\u03b3 could explain discrepancies between models, where IFN-\u03b3 limits effector expansion in some models (e.g., our study, refs. 47, 48), but not in all (e.g., refs. 24, 49). Our data demonstrating that integrin costimulation is required for limiting T cell effector generation suggest that the presence of cofactors represents one of a series of possible modifiers of IFN-\u03b3 signaling and function specification.We also demonstrated that early IFN-\u03b3 production by CD8 T cells acts in a paracrine manner to limit effector CD8 T cell differentiation through integrin-mediated T-T contacts. However, it is important to note that blocking IFN-\u03b3 (this study) does not phenocopy blocking T-T contacts as a whole (26) . Whereas integration of IFN-\u03b3 and integrin signaling pathways restricts T cell effector differentiation, T-T contacts promote both effector and central memory differentiation (26) . This discrepancy is likely due to the role T-T synapses play as a \"platform,\" fostering a network of diverse signals shared exclusively between T cells. Some of these may also be temporal and include contributions from other cell-cell contacts in vivo. Our study provides one instance of such a platform function. Importantly, where integrin activation is dictated by the encounter with the antigen early during priming and will reflect the strength of activation, IFN-\u03b3 secretion is determined by cell location and environment. Together, a platform of T-T synapses allows for those distinct signals to integrate themselves through costimulation of IFN-\u03b3 signaling by integrin coengagement.Although it is usually accepted that cytokine signals are tightly localized, affecting only cells near the cytokine source, cytokines can permeate a tissue and modify the majority of cells therein (50) . The polarized secretion of IFN-\u03b3 in CD8 T cells argues for localized cytokine delivery, but our data not do not contradict the existence of IFN-\u03b3 permeation, as NK cells do not seem to secrete IFN-\u03b3 in a polarized manner. Overall, this might imply that NK cells would be the source of systemic IFN-\u03b3 (51), whereas low levels of IFN-\u03b3 produced by CD8 T cells would be specifically directed toward its target with signaling amplified or specified further by integrin coengagement. The fact that previous T cell activation is necessary for this (26) means that while IFN-\u03b3 might be spread throughout the spleen, only cells in the correct state of activation and engaging integrins will adequately respond to this cue. Overall, having methods to locally boost IFN-\u03b3 signaling by integrins at a synapse may optimize efficient independent experiments. **P < 0.001, ***P < 0.0002 and ****P < 0.0001. ns, not significant.T cell-mediated pathogen clearance programs while restricting harmful bystander responses.", "citance": "Alternately, it has recently been shown that transient IFN-\u03b3 exposure elicits long-lived inflammatory responses in cancer cells due to IFN-\u03b3 retention by phosphatidylserine (PS) on the surface of viable cells (44) .", "claims": [{"text": "Transient IFN-\u03b3 exposure leads to long-lived infammatory responses in cancer cells due to IFN-\u03b3 retention on the cell surface.

The genomic pool of this macro-community is named microbiome. The gut microbiota is essential for the complete development of the immune system, representing a binary network in which the microbiota interact with the host providing important immune and physiologic function and conversely the bacteria protect themselves from host immune defense. Alterations in the balance of the gut microbiome due to a combination of environmental and genetic factors can now be associated with detrimental or protective effects in experimental autoimmune diseases. These gut microbiome alterations can unbalance the gastrointestinal immune responses and influence distal effector sites leading to CNS disease including both demyelination and affective disorders. The current range of risk factors for MS includes genetic makeup and environmental elements. Of interest to this review is the consistency between this range of MS risk factors and the gut microbiome. We postulate that the gut microbiome serves as the niche where different MS risk factors merge, thereby influencing the disease process.", "citation_paragraph": "Evidence suggests an association between obesity, gut microbiota, and the induction of Th17 responses that could relate obesity with various autoimmune disorders. In accordance with the experimental data, the worldwide increase in the incidence of obesity and metabolic diseases such as T2D has been associated with changes in dietary habits [60] . The direct effect of hormones in diet and obesity may also play a role in disease severity. Adiposederived hormones and adipokines, cytokines produced by adipose cells, might constitute which diet/obesity regulate the immune system. Leptin is a hormone produced by adipose tissue, but also by the stomach, skeletal muscles and placenta. The proportion of fat mass in the tissue regulates leptin production. Leptin controls food intake and influences the autonomic nervous system and regulates the production of other hormones. Mice that are deficient in leptin or in the receptors for leptin are obese and suffer from severe immune system alterations. Interestingly, leptin-deficient mice do not develop EAE [61] while neutralizing leptin in EAE mice reduces disease severity [62] . In MS patients, high levels of leptin are observed in active CNS lesions [63] , and in sera and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [64] . Thus, the neuroendocrine system, tightly regulated by nutritional factors and habits, affects significantly the immune system [65] . Fasting for instance, that reduces the levels of circulating leptin, impacts proinflammatory responses and regulates EAE severity [66] . Other hormones of the gut-brain axis have shown modulatory functions in autoimmunity: Neuropeptides, such as vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) affect the induction of Tregs and migration patterns of immune cells. VIP has been shown to induce FoxP3 + Tregs and be protective against experimental rheumatoid arthritis [67] and diminish the severity of murine EAE [68] . In mice, diet-induced gut microbiome changes promote significant changes in the inflammatory responses elicited by the adipose tissue [69] . Moreover, the connection between adipose-derived hormones and the gut microbiome has been seen to influence the fat-gene regulation in the CNS [70] . These effects of the gut microbiome on the neuroendocrine system would then be essential in the regulation of inflammation and disease severity.It is known now that the composition of the gut microbiota of obese donors is significantly different to that from lean individuals [71] , and that diet impacts the composition of the gut microbiome [55] . Westernized diet increases the relative abundance of Firmicutes and reduces Bacteriodetes in mice [72] . In humans, obesity was associated with reduced bacterial diversity and reduced abundance of Bacteroidetes [71] . When fed with a western diet for eight weeks, GF mice gain significantly less weight and fat mass than conventional mice and are protected against diet-induced glucose intolerance [73] . When conventional mice receive a high-fat diet the levels of plasma free fatty acids increase. Plasma free fatty acids enhancement during HFD consumption and obesity has been associated with inflammatory syndrome and insulin resistance, exacerbating inflammation, and promoting oxidative stress by releasing of reactive oxygen species [74] . These enhanced free fatty acid levels while subjected to high-fat diets are reduced by the treatment with antibiotics against the gut microbiome [75] . In EAE, HFD administration exacerbates EAE severity [76] through the activation of Th17 cells whereas a caloric-restricted diet ameliorates disease [77] . Protection by the administration of caloric-restricted diet to SJL mice was associated with enhanced plasma levels of corticosterone and adiponectin and reduced IL-6 and leptin.The disruption in the balanced gut microbiota is termed \"dysbiosis.\" Dysbiosis has been suggested to be responsible for intestinal inflammation that is observed in patients suffering from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In IBS patients, the gut microbiome composition differs significantly from healthy individuals [78] . In IBD patients, the analysis of the gut microbiota revealed statistically significant differences between the populations of Crohn's disease patients and ulcerative colitis patients and healthy individuals [79] . To date, no studies on the gut microbiome of multiple sclerosis patients have been documented, however, experimental data support the importance of the gut microbiome in the control of the severity of the disease [80] .", "citance": "These enhanced free fatty acid levels while subjected to high-fat diets are reduced by the treatment with antibiotics against the gut microbiome [75] .", "claims": [{"text": "Treating the gut microbiome with antibiotics heightens levels of enhanced free fatty acids in patients with high-fat diets.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Treating the gut microbiome with antibiotics reduces the levels of enhanced free fatty acids in patients with high-fat diets.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

This is the core tissue of insulin-mediated glucose uptake via glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4). The extracellular matrix (ECM) provides integrity and biochemical signals and plays an important role in myogenesis. In addition, it undergoes remodeling upon injury and/or repair, which is also related to insulin resistance (IR), a major cause of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Altered signaling of integrin and ECM remodeling in diet-induced obesity is associated with IR. This review highlights the interweaving relationship between the ECM, IR, and skeletal muscle. In addition, the importance of the ECM in muscle integrity as well as cellular functions is explored. IR and skeletal muscle ECM remodeling has been discussed in clinical and nonclinical aspects. Furthermore, this review considers the role of ECM glycation and its effects on skeletal muscle homeostasis, concentrating on advanced glycation end products (AGEs) as an important risk factor for the development of IR. Understanding this complex interplay between the ECM, muscle, and IR may improve knowledge and help develop new ideas for novel therapeutics for several IR-associated myopathies and diabetes.", "citation_paragraph": "The ECM is a complex milieu of diverse structural molecules involved in structural support together with cellular signaling and tissue responses to diseases and injuries [16] . An organization of ECM molecules have their own distinct features and is responsible for the various biological activities [16, 17] . A number of muscle-related genetically determined diseases are caused primarily by mutations in the ECM components and their receptors. For example, more than 150 ECM proteins interact with the adhesion site of the integrin receptor [18, 19] . Maricela et al. performed a clinical study involving 66 patients with Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD/BMD), hyperinsulinemia, IR, and obesity. They suggested that an alteration in GLUT4 in muscle fibers from DMD/BMD patients might be involved in IR [20] .Different types of collagens are expressed in skeletal muscle with their specific role (Table 1) . Collagens can be subdivided broadly into various subfamilies according to the sequence similarities and supramolecular assemblies they form, for example, fibrils, beaded filaments, anchoring fibrils, and networks [21] . Fibrillar collagens (types I, II, III, V, XI, XXIV, and XXVII) generally provide three-dimensional structures for tissues and organs [22] . These networks have mechanical strength and signaling functions by binding to the ECM components and cellular receptors. More than 90% of the collagens were found to be expressed in skeletal muscle and were composed mostly of collagen I, III, and IV [23, 24] . Although collagen I and III encompasses fibrillar collagen, collagen IV is the most plentiful structural component of the BM [12, 25] . Type I collagen is the most important and ample protein in the vertebrates (including humans), found ubiquitously in connective tissues, and is usually involved in the promotion of membrane proteinase activation, which leads to cellular migration and adhesion [26] [27] [28] . The packing and positioning of subfibrillar elements of the collagen structure characterize most of the biologically substantial aspects of the fibrillar collagen structure [26, 28] . Seminal studies have shown that changes in the composition of the ECM (generally increased collagen) are a general characteristic of IR human skeletal muscle [12] . FN is a modular protein and an important structural element in the niche of MSCs that plays a vital role in the muscle regeneration process. The loss of FN from the niche affects many pathways and cellular mechanisms involved in MSC aging. In aged skeletal muscle, FN triggers adhesion signaling and functioning of MSCs. Treatment with FN is shown to restore the regenerative capacity of aged muscles [29] . In the previous studies, we explored the role of fibromodulin (FMOD) and matrix gla protein (MGP), the ECM proteins, involved in myoblast differentiation by regulating the interaction of myostatin (MSTN) with its receptor activin receptor type IIB (ACVRIIB). Involvement of FMOD and MGP in the regulation of myogenesis provides a clue for the development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of the different types of muscle diseases because it plays an important role by recruiting more MSCs to the sites of muscle injury [8, [30] [31] [32] . V Fibril-forming collagen and found to be increased in skeletal muscle ECM mRNA levels [35] VI Found to be increased in skeletal muscle ECM mRNA levels [35] IX Multiple-epiphyseal-dysplasia-related myopathy is caused due to mutation in collagen IX [36] XII It is the largest member of the fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helix (FACIT) family. Important for muscle integrity.[37]XIV A member of FACIT family and involved in muscle metabolism [38] XV Extensively found in the basement membrane and a structural component vital to stabilizing the skeletal muscle [39] XVIII Classified as multiplexins, bind with growth factors and other membranes of basement membrane glycoproteins. [39] ECM homeostasis is vital for normal functioning of a cell and for stable communication among cells, and a disruption of this homeostasis may have an adverse effect on the functioning of organ systems and promote many deadly diseases (e.g., fibrotic diseases and cancer) [40] . Furthermore, it has been reported on several occasions that the expression of several ECM proteins is altered during the onset of T2DM, and that these alterations change the ECM networks and consequently cell-to-cell and cell-to-ECM interactions [41] . The ECM components communicate with cells through cell surface receptors, and integrins are the most important. These receptors are composed of heterodimeric (alpha and beta) subunits, which interact with different types of the ECM ligands [13] . Seven alpha (\u03b1) subunits (\u03b11, \u03b13, \u03b14, \u03b15, \u03b16, \u03b17, and \u03b1v) in association with the \u03b21 subunit are expressed in the skeletal muscle [13, 42] .

To examine this we administered 1 and 5 mg/kg doses of the endocannabinoid uptake inhibitor AM404; 5 and 25 microg/kg doses of HU-210, a potent CB1 receptor agonist; 1, 2.5 and 5 mg/kg of oleamide, which elicits cannabinoidergic actions; 1 and 5 mg/kg doses of AM 251, a selective CB1 receptor antagonist, as well as 10 mg/kg desipramine (a positive antidepressant control) and measured the duration of immobility, during a 5-min test session of the rat Porsolt forced swim test. Results demonstrated that administration of desipramine reduced immobility duration by about 50% and that all of AM404, oleamide and HU-210 administration induced comparable decreases in immobility that were blocked by pretreatment with AM 251. Administration of the antagonist AM 251 alone had no effect on immobility at either dose. These data suggest that enhancement of CB1 receptor signaling results in antidepressant effects in the forced swim test similar to that seen following conventional antidepressant administration.", "citation_paragraph": "These data indicate that pharmacological enhancement of CB 1 receptor activity elicits an antidepressant effect in the rat forced swim test, as demonstrated by significant reductions in immobility. The ability of CB 1 receptor activity to reduce immobility was comparable to that seen with desipramine, a typical tricyclic antidepressant that is known to reliably elicit an antidepressant response in the FST (Connor et al., 1998) . The reduction in immobility induced by pharmacological activation of the CB 1 receptor in this paradigm is likely not mediated by increases in motor activity because cannabinoids are known to reduce motor functioning (Rodriguez de Fonseca et al., 1998) , suggesting that it is very unlikely that these effects are false positives. Furthermore, administration of a CB 1 receptor antagonist, which is known to stimulate motor functioning (Bass et al., 2002) , did not alter immobility levels demonstrating the specificity of this measure.This study demonstrated that treatment with the EC uptake inhibitor AM404 (Beltramo et al., 1997) resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the expression of immobility that was largely attenuated by pretreatment with the selective CB 1 receptor antagonist AM 251, indicating that this effect was likely mediated by the CB 1 receptor. Examination of the putative effect of CB 1 receptor activity in the FST demonstrated that the potent CB 1 receptor agonist HU-210 mimicked the effects of AM404 by reducing the occurrence of immobility, which was also blocked by antagonism of the CB 1 receptor. These data together suggest that pharmacological activation of the CB 1 receptor elicits an antidepressant-like effect in this preclinical paradigm.Previous research has demonstrated that exogenous cannabinoids, such as THC, possess the ability to inhibit the reuptake of dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin (Banerjee et al., 1975; Steffens and Feuerstein, 2004) , suggesting that they may have a mechanism of action similar to that of tricyclic antidepressants, such as desipramine. However, other evidence has demonstrated that cannabinoids also possess the ability to inhibit serotonin release in cortical slices (Nakazi et al., 2000) and pharmacological antagonism of CB 1 receptors results in cortical serotonin and norepinephrine release (Tzavara et al., 2003) . Thus, further biochemical work is required to ascertain which similarities between the mechanism of action of conventional antidepressants and the pharmacological actions of cannabinoids may mediate this response.Oleamide, like AM404 and HU-210, resulted in a dosedependent reduction in immobility. These data are in line with recent research demonstrating that sleep deprivation reduces immobility in the forced swim test (LopezRodriguez et al., 2004) , as oleamide concentrations are known to elevate following sleep deprivation (Lerner et al., 1994) . The anti-immobility effect of oleamide in this study was found to be sensitive to blockade of CB 1 receptors, suggesting that this effect was mediated by engagement of the EC system. Oleamide is known to act as a competitive inhibitor of FAAH (Mechoulam et al., 1997; Lichtman et al., 2002) , the enzyme responsible for EC degradation, thus the effects demonstrated in this study could be due to elevations in EC concentration. It should be noted that this entourage effect of oleamide on anandamide hydrolysis requires high levels of oleamide (Mechoulam et al., 1997) . The doses used in this study were relatively low, however, the administration of oleamide three times within a 24-h period in this study may have produced high enough concentrations of oleamide to reduce hydrolysis of anandamide. Alternatively, it has been shown that oleamide has the ability to interact directly with the CB 1 receptor in vitro (Leggett et al., 2004) , however this is in contrast to the previous reports demonstrating the opposite finding (Mechoulam et al., 1997; Lichtman et al., 2002) . Despite this controversy, the possibility does exist that oleamide may be acting as a direct CB 1 receptor agonist in vivo. Together, these findings suggest that oleamide elicits a robust antidepressant-like effect in the FST that is similar to that seen following sleep deprivation, and that the EC system is involved in this effect. An interesting follow-up to this study would be to examine directly if the antidepressant effects of sleep deprivation are mediated by oleamide, or through interactions with the EC system. Interestingly, administration of the selective CB 1 receptor antagonist AM251 did not affect the presence of immobility in the FST, an unanticipated finding. It should be noted though that the lack of effect on immobility found here contrasts with findings from other research. Recently it was shown that administration of either AM251 or SR 141716A, another selective CB 1 receptor antagonist, had an antidepressant effect in the mouse forced swim test (Shearman et al., 2003; Tzavara et al., 2003) . However, the mouse FST is fundamentally different in design (it involves only a single swim trial), suggesting three major possibilities to explain this difference. First, many drugs are known to elicit differential responses in the rat versus the mouse FST (Borsini and Meli, 1988) . Second, the rat FST is largely based on a learned response where the animals learn that active behaviors do not facilitate their escape, whereas in mice the test simply measures their response to novel drug administration (Borsini and Meli, 1988; Cryan et al., 2002) . Third, the possibility exists that EC signaling could elicit a biphasic effect on depressive-like behaviors in the same manner as it does for anxiety-like behavior. For example, HU-210 is anxiolytic at low doses and anxiogenic at high doses (Hill and Gorzalka, 2004; Marco et al., 2004) and both CB 1 receptor agonists and antagonists have been shown to be anxiogenic and anxiolytic (Berrendero and Maldonado, 2002; Navarro et al., 1997; Akinshola et al., 1999) , reflecting the fact that changes in EC signaling may be both antidepressant-like and depressive-like, depending on factors such as testing conditions, strain and species of animal and drug dose.The present data along with data obtained from other laboratories suggest that enhanced EC activity occurs in many regimens that elicit an antidepressant response. Both sleep deprivation and environmental enrichment (Porsolt et al., 1978; Lopez-Rodriguez et al., 2004) are known to elicit positive responses in the FST. Furthermore, environmental enrichment elevates anandamide concentrations (Wolf and Matzinger, 2003) , and sleep deprivation increases levels of oleamide (Lerner et al., 1994) , which then acts as a competitive substrate for FAAH and prevents AEA catabolism (Mechoulam et al., 1997) , suggesting that the reduction in immobility in the FST seen following these regimens may be due in part to enhanced EC activity. This idea is substantiated by the present data demonstrating that oleamide elicits a CB 1 receptor-dependent reduction in immobility in the FST. The results of this study demonstrate that enhancement of EC activity alone is sufficient to elicit an antidepressant response. This hypothesis is further supported by a knowledge that activation of this system results in mood enhancement (Green et al., 2003) and antidepressant effects (Williamson and Evans, 2000) in humans, and that suppression of this system can induce anxiogenic and depressive-like effects in non-human species .One aspect of the EC system that makes it particularly advantageous for the treatment of depression is its ability to elicit fast acting responses. For example, current antidepressant therapies such as treatment with fluoxetine require 2 -6 weeks to become therapeutically effective (Thase et al., 2001) . Pharmacological agents which influence EC activity, such as AM404, are known to have very fast acting behavioral effects (Gonzalez et al., 1999) . This is supported by knowledge that cannabis consumption in humans results in behavioral and mood alterations within a matter of minutes (Ohlsson et al., 1980) . Therefore, in addition to their ability to elicit antidepressant responses, drugs which target the EC system may also have a significant advantage in the pharmacotherapy of affective disease because of their fast acting potential. Furthermore, the apparent anxiolytic properties elicited by FAAH inhibition (Kathuria et al., 2003) also suggest that this avenue is advantageous because of the potential to treat both anxiety and depression. However, due to the high frequency of aversive reactions to cannabis in depressed patients (Ablon and Goodwin, 1974) inhibition of EC degradation may be a more suitable target for antidepressant treatment than cannabis itself, especially for subtypes of major depression, such as melancholic depression, which are characterized by hypophagia, insomnia, anhedonia and anxiety (Gold and Chrousos, 2002) .", "citance": "This study demonstrated that treatment with the EC uptake inhibitor AM404 (Beltramo et al., 1997) resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the expression of immobility that was largely attenuated by pretreatment with the selective CB 1 receptor antagonist AM 251, indicating that this effect was likely mediated by the CB 1 receptor.", "claims": [{"text": "Treatment with the EC uptake inhibitor AM404 does not have an appreciable effect on expression of immobility.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Treatment with the EC uptake inhibitor AM404 resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the expression of immobility.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Whilst the short-term outcomes post-transplant have improved in the last decades, chronic rejection and immunosuppressant side effects remain an ongoing concern. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a well-established procedure for the treatment of patients with haematological disorders. However, donor T cells are continually primed and activated to react against the host causing graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) that leads to tissue damages and death. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play an essential role in maintaining tolerance to self-antigens, preventing excessive immune responses and abrogating autoimmunity. Due to their suppressive properties, Tregs have been extensively studied for their use as a cellular therapy aiming to treat GvHD and limit immune responses responsible for graft rejection. Several clinical trials have been conducted or are currently ongoing to investigate safety and feasibility of Treg-based therapy. This review summarizes the general understanding of Treg biology and presents the methods used to isolate and expand Tregs. Furthermore, we describe data from the first clinical trials using Tregs, explaining the limitations and future application of these cells.", "citation_paragraph": "The multiple subpopulations of Tregs are distinguished by the expression of different cell surface markers, mechanisms of activation and how they function (reviewed by us in [30] [43] . From a functional perspective, the various potential suppressive mechanisms could be divided into four 'modes of action': (A) metabolic interference, (B) inhibitory cytokine release, (C) cytolysis and (D) targeting antigen presenting cells (APCs) (extensively reviewed in [44] ).Briefly, (A) T cells depend on IL-2 for survival and proliferation, Tregs constitutively express high levels of CD25 which depletes IL-2 from the microenvironment and limiting its availability for T-cell functions [18] . Additionally, CD39 and CD73 are ecto-enzymes found on the surfaces of Tregs. Firstly, CD39 converts proinflammatory extracellular adenosine triphosphate into adenosine monophosphate (AMP); secondly, CD73 converts AMP into anti-inflammatory adenosine [45] . (B) Tregs can release immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-10, IL-35 and TGF-b to prevent T-cell proliferation and maturation of APC [46] [47] [48] . (C) Tregs secrete granzymes and perforins which cause apoptosis of target cells [44] . (D) Tregs are the only T-cell subpopulation that constitutively expresses CTLA-4; it binds CD80/ CD86, the co-stimulatory molecules expressed by APCs, to block their binding to CD28, thus limiting T-cell activation. Furthermore, CTLA-4 can also downregulate DCs' activity via trans-endocytosis or extraction of CD80 and CD86 resulting in diminished co-stimulation [49] . Very recently, a novel mechanism of Treg suppression was discovered by us and others. It refers to the release of nano-sized vesicles called exosomes that are immunomodulatory. We demonstrated that Tregderived exosomes inhibited T-cell proliferation in vitro via CD73 molecules found on the surfaces of these exosomes [50] . Additionally, Okoye et al. [51] have shown that Treg-derived exosomes prevented autoimmune diseases in vivo which was attributed to the presence of inhibitory microRNA within these exosomes. Another study demonstrated that the adoptive transfer of Tregderived exosomes into a rat model of kidney transplantation prolonged the survival of the allograft [52] .

On the other hand, components of specific immune cell-derived exosomes may contribute to the efficacy of antitumor immunotherapy. In this review, we demonstrate the pivotal role of exosomes in the triangular relationship in the tumor microenvironment between the tumor, inflammation, and immunity, which may provide potential strategies for tumor immunotherapy at genetic and cellular levels.", "citation_paragraph": "Another vital function of exosomes that is related to disease progression is the modulation of inflammation [20, 21] . Exosomes can promote or inhibit the development of inflammation. Hypoxia-induced delivery of miR-23a from exosomes secreted by tubular epithelial cells was shown to promote macrophage activation and trigger tubulointerstitial inflammation [22] . Similarly, miR-150-5p and miR-142-3p from dendritic cell-(DC-) released exosomes can be transferred to regulatory T cells (Tregs), resulting in an increase in interleukin 10 (IL-10) expression and a decrease in IL-6 expression [23] . Choroid plexus epithelial cells can release exosomes that contain miR-146a and miR-155, which upregulate the expression of inflammatory cytokines in astrocytes and microglia [24] . Another type of exosome exhibits protective effects against inflammation-related diseases [25] . In endometriosis, exosomal miR-138 can protect against inflammation by decreasing the expression level of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), a transcription factor that regulates inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and IL-18 [26] .

Analyses of sarcoplasmic proteome of semimembranosus muscles from control (CON; diet without ractopamine) and ractopamine-fed (RAC; 7.4 mg/kg for 14 days followed by 10.0 mg/kg for 14 days) barrows revealed that haemoglobin subunit beta, alpha-crystallin B, and titin fragments were over-abundant in CON. In contrast, myosin light chain 1/3 and tripartite motif-containing protein 72 were over-abundant in RAC. The low abundance of haemoglobin subunit beta and alpha crystallin B in RAC could be attributed to fibre type shift (from oxidative to glycolytic) in response to ractopamine. The over-abundance of MLC 1/3 and tripartite motif-containing protein 72 in RAC could be due to the increased myofibrillar protein synthesis and muscle mass in ractopamine-fed pigs. Dietary ractopamine decreased the abundance of sarcoplasmic proteins involved in oxygen transport and chaperone activity, but increased the abundance of proteins involved in muscle contraction and plasma membrane repair in pork semimembranosus muscle.

Four protein spots were over-abundant (P <0.05) in CON, whereas 2 spots were over-abundant (P <0.05) in RAC. The identity of these proteins and their functional roles are listed in Table 1 .Haemoglobin subunit beta was over-abundant in the CON group (Table 1) . Haemoglobin is a tetrameric heme protein comprising 2 alpha (141 residues each) and 2 beta (146 residues each) subunits, and is the major oxygen carrier protein. Based on metabolism, skeletal muscles fibres are classified into 3 types, namely oxidative, oxido-glycolytic, and glycolytic (Peter et al., 1972) . Ractopamine functions as a repartitioning agent in skeletal muscles and activates beta-adrenergic receptors, leading to fibre type shifting from oxidative to glycolytic, thereby promoting glycolytic metabolism (Aalhus et al., 1992; Depreux et al., 2002; Gunawan et al., 2007) . The decreased abundance of haemoglobin in the RAC group could possibly be attributed to this shift in metabolism from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism in response to ractopamine feeding. Glycolytic metabolism has lower oxygen demand compared to oxidative, which minimizes the necessity for haemoglobin to transport oxygen to the skeletal muscles. Haemoglobin is a minor contributor to color of fresh meats (Mancini & Hunt, 2005; Suman & Joseph, 2013) and previous proteomic investigation on pork semimembranosus sarcoplasm reported that haemoglobin was of greater abundance in dark muscles than in light muscles (Sayd et al., 2006) . Several previous studies observed that fresh meat from pigs fed ractopamine had lower a* values (redness) than meat from animals raised on control diets (Uttaro et al., 1993; Armstrong et al., 2004; Carr et al., 2005a; 2005b; Apple et al., 2008) . The decreased abundance of haemoglobin subunit beta in the RAC group suggested that ractopamine feeding may cause a decrease in a* value of pork (Aalhus et al., 1990) , attributing to the shift from intermediate fibres to white fibres (Depreux et al., 2002; Gunawan et al., 2007) .Spots 3 and 4 ( Fig. 1) were identified as titin fragments and were over-abundant in the CON group (Table 1) . Titin is the largest protein in mammals and has a molecular weight of approximately 3,800 kDa; it is the third most abundant myofibrillar protein (Labeit et al., 1997) . Although titin is a myofibrillar protein, the appearance of its fragments in sarcoplasm could be due to post-mortem proteolysis (Taylor et al., 1995) . The low sequence coverage of titin (Table 1) could be attributed to multiple proteases, such as calpain proteinases (Huff-Lonergan et al., 2010; Lian et al., 2013) , lysing the protein into small fragments and the large size (more than 34,000 amino acids) of titin molecules. Degradation of titin has been reported to increase meat tenderness (Huff-Lonergan et al., 1995) , and the over-abundance of titin fragments in CON could be due to decreased proteolysis in the RAC group. In support, dietary ractopamine has been reported to decrease proteolytic activity in pork longissimus (Xiong et al., 2006) .Myosin light chain (MLC) 1/3 was over-abundant in the RAC group (Table 1) . These findings are also supported by Costa-Lima et al. (2015) , who reported a greater abundance of MLC 1/3 in longissimus thoracis of ractopamine-fed pigs than in pigs fed a control diet. Myosin is a myofibrillar protein, and the hexameric myosin molecule consists of 2 heavy chains (MHC), 2 regulatory light chains (RLC), and 2 alkali light chains (MLC 1, MLC 3) in fast-twitch skeletal muscles (Frank & Weeds, 1974) . Two alkali light chains (MLC 1 and MLC 3) observed in the sarcoplasmic fraction in the present study could be the products of proteolytic cleavage, which releases the light chain sub-units from the actomyosin complex to sarcoplasm (Gerlemann et al., 2014) . (Fig. 1) . For each spot, parameters related to protein identification are provided (UniProt accession number; ProtScore and number of matched peptides; sequence coverage of peptides in tandem mass spectrometry) b CON = 0 mg/kg ractopamine in finishing diet for 28 days; RAC = 7.4 mg/kg ractopamine in finishing diet for 14 days followed by 10.0 mg/kg for 14 days c Spot ratio of CON/RAC d Spot ratio of RAC/CON Previous studies documented that dietary ractopamine increased myofibrillar protein synthesis in pork longissimus (Adeola et al., 1992) . Furthermore, Helferich et al. (1990) observed an increase in the MLC 1/3 RNA expression in ractopamine-fed porcine longissimus indicating protein accretion and increase in muscle mass. The greater abundance of MLC 1/3 in the RAC group than in the CON group observed in the present study could be due to the increased myofibrillar protein synthesis in response to ractopamine. Several proteomic investigations have been undertaken to identify the relationship between myosin light chains and meat quality. A positive correlation between MLC 1 and shear force has been observed in pork longissimus (Hwang et al., 2005) . Furthermore, in beef longissimus thoracis, MLC 1 was of greater abundance in tough meat than in tender meat (Bjarnadottir et al., 2012) .Tripartite motif-containing protein 72 plays a critical role in plasma membrane repair and was overabundant in the RAC group (Table 1) . The cellular mechanism for plasma membrane repair and remodelling, to maintain cellular homeostasis in response to various physiological and pathological conditions, is conserved across eukaryotes (Han & Campbell, 2007) . Tripartite motif-containing protein 72 (mitsugumin-53) is an essential component involved in plasma membrane repair in mouse skeletal muscle (Cai et al., 2009) . It is well documented that dietary ractopamine increases carcass weight in finishing pigs (Stites et al., 1991; Armstrong et al., 2004; Fernandez-Duenas et al., 2008) . Furthermore, an increase in the weight of inside ham (consisting of semimembranosus muscle) was observed in ractopamine-fed pigs (Boler et al., 2011) . The increased muscle growth due to ractopamine could possibly demand increased levels of plasma membrane repair proteins to maintain homeostasis. Therefore, the over-abundance of tripartite motifcontaining protein 72 in RAC could be attributed to the increased muscle mass accretion in ractopamine-fed animals (Bohrer et al., 2013) .", "citance": "Tripartite motif-containing protein 72 (mitsugumin-53) is an essential component involved in plasma membrane repair in mouse skeletal muscle (Cai et al., 2009) .", "claims": [{"text": "Tripartite motif-containing protein 72 (mitsugumin-53) is essential in plasma membrane repair of mouse skeletal muscle.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

Here, we report that optineurin is localized in podocytes of the kidney and induced upon injury following treatment with puromycin aminonucleoside. In cultured human podocytes, optineurin localizes to the Golgi complex. Optineurin depletion by RNA interference causes Golgi fragmentation. Moreover, if the Golgi complex is fragmented following microtubule destabilization induced by nocodazole treatment, optineurin dissociates from Golgi vesicles. Furthermore, optineurin colocalizes with vinculin-labeled focal contacts of cultured podocytes and with lysosome-like structures. Optineurin is essential for the survival of cultured podocytes, as optineurin depletion causes cell death. Thus, optineurin appears to play an important role in the maintenance of the podocyte Golgi complex and in the trafficking of vesicles to focal contacts and lysosomes.", "citation_paragraph": "Optineurin is a cytosolic protein that localizes to the transGolgi network via binding to the small GTPase Rab8. It is thought to act as an adapter protein that links the Golgi network via interaction with huntingtin (Hattula and Per\u00e4nen 2000; Sahlender et al. 2005; Del Toro et al. 2009 ) to the microtubule network (Caviston et al. 2007 ) and, via binding to the motor protein myosin VI, to the actin cytoskeleton. These interactions appear to stabilize the Golgi structure and to promote vesicular trafficking (Sahlender et al. 2005) . Deficiency of optineurin results in decreased secretion and apoptosis (Sahlender et al. 2005; Sippl et al. 2011) . Moreover, optineurin has been reported to be involved in nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) signaling (Zhu et al. 2007 ), cell division (Kachaner et al. 2012a ), viral (Gleason et al. 2011 ) and bacterial immune responses, and autophagy (Wild et al. 2011) . The functional properties of optineurin appear to be primarily important for neurons. Mutations in the Optineurin (OPTN) gene are causative for rare forms of primary open-angle glaucoma (Rezaie et al. 2002) , an optic neuropathy that is associated with progressive degeneration of retinal ganglion axons and somata (Quigley 2011) . Indeed, the term optineurin is an acronym for \"optic neuropathy inducing\" protein (Rezaie et al. 2002) . Moreover, mutations in optineurin are causative for some cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Maruyama et al. 2010 ), a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of motor neurons (Rowland and Shneider 2001) .In addition to its role in neurons, optineurin is also expressed in the kidney (Rezaie et al. 2005; Li et al. 2008) in which it might be involved in regulating the localization of polycystin 2 (PC2), a cation channel associated with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) induces the expression of optineurin resulting in the loss of PC2 at its correct localization at both the plasma membrane and primary cilium, a scenario that leads to cyst formation (Li et al. 2008) .Here, we report that most of the detectable optineurin in the kidney localizes to podocytes. Podocytes constitute a highly differentiated cell type of the kidney glomerulus and are essential for the glomerular filtration barrier; they share some similarities in structure and gene expression with neurons (Kobayashi 2002) .

{"s2orc_id": 2304261, "title": "Detection and visualization of dural pulsation for spine needle interventions", "abstract": "Epidural and spinal anesthesia are common procedures that require a needle to be inserted into the patient\u2019s spine to deliver an anesthetic. Traditionally, these procedures were performed without image guidance, using only palpation to identify the correct vertebral interspace. More recently, ultrasound has seen widespread use in guiding spinal needle interventions. Dural pulsation is a valuable cue for finding a path through the vertebral interspace and for determining needle insertion depth. However, dural pulsation is challenging to detect and not perceptible in many cases. Here, a method for automatically detecting very subtle dural pulsation from live ultrasound video is presented. A periodic model is fit to the B-mode intenstity values through extended Kalman filtering. The fitted frequencies and amplitudes are used to detect and visualize dural pulsation. The method is validated retrospectively on synthetic and human video and used in real time on an interventional spinal phantom. This method was capable of quickly identifying subtle dural pulsation and was robust to background noise and motion. The pulsation visualization reduced both the normalized path length and number of attempts required in a mock epidural procedure. This technique is able to localize the dura and help find a clear needle trajectory to the epidural space. It can be run in real time on commercial ultrasound systems and has the potential to improve ultrasound guidance of spine needle interventions.", "citation_paragraph": "Epidural injections are a common intervention with an estimated 293,000 procedures performed annually in the United Kingdom [7] . There is increasing interest in using periopertive epidural injection as concurrent epidural and general anesthesia reduce the morbidity and mortality for a wide variety of surgeries [19] . Accurate localization of the dura is critical in epidural and spinal anesthesia as advancing the needle too far has the potential to cause severe damage to the spinal cord resulting in long-term neurological complications. In epidural injections, the analgesic must be injected into the epidural space inside the spinal canal but outside the dura. This procedure is traditionally performed using a blind technique in which the vertebral interspace is identified solely using palpation, and the needle depth is determined by the anesthetist feeling for a loss of resistance indicative of the needle puncturing the ligamentum flavum and entering the epidural space. Spinal anesthesia is performed similarly, but the needle is inserted through the dura and the anesthetic injected into the subarachnoid space using a smaller needle delivering much less anesthetic. Without image guidance, even identifying a specific vertebral interspace is a challenging task where experts are successful in fewer than half the cases [4, 10] . Multiple attempts at needle insertion are common [6, 12] and a small but significant number of cases result in long-term complications [21] . Spinal ultrasound, acquired from a midline or paramedian view, is becoming increasingly common in spinal needle interventions [11, 12] . Ultrasound guidance can significantly reduce the number of failed and traumatic procedures as well as the number of needle insertion attempts per procedure [25] . The vertebrae are readily visible in US, aiding in selecting the needle trajectory, but the image quality is poor within the spinal canal making it difficult to locate the dura and other important features.However, the changing pressure of the cerebral spinal fluid throughout the cardiac cycle caused by the vascularization of the brain and spinal cord results in a subtle pulsation of the dural membrane which can be perceived in US. The visual presence of dura pulsation also confirms the correct paramedian position of the US probe as it indicates the presence of a large acoustic window between the vertebra which may be suitable for needle insertion. This pulsation is a valuable cue for identifying the dura and ensuring that the needle is inserted to the appropriate depth, but it is only perceived in approximately 30 % of cases [12] .Currently, there is no suitable technique for detecting dural motion. While anesthetists have become accustomed to using Doppler US to detect important vessels in other nerve block procedures, identifying dural pulsation through Doppler US is challenging because of the low velocity of the motion, which is often orthogonal to the beam direction. Speckle tracking techniques are another alternative that have been used to assess dural pulsation in cervical laminoplasty, but required imaging perpendicular to the spinal cord using a view preselected with MRI [13] . The out-ofplane motion, particularly significant with the paramedian approach, severely degrades methods that rely on explicit motion or velocity estimation. This paper develops a technique to identify and display subtle dural pulsation that may be missed in an interventional setting by fitting a harmonic model to individual pixel intensities through extended Kalman filtering. By only looking for periodicity in the intensity values, this method does not require an explicit motion model and is agnostic to whether the intensity changes are caused by out-of-plane motion. This method can run in real time, requires only the B-mode video, and is easily integrated into existing imaging systems allowing pulsatile motion to be visualized on the original US image or in an augmented reality guidance system.", "citance": "Ultrasound guidance can significantly reduce the number of failed and traumatic procedures as well as the number of needle insertion attempts per procedure [25] .", "claims": [{"text": "Ultrasound guidance leads to an increase in the number of needle insertion attempts necessary for a given procedure.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Ultrasound guidance significantly increases the number of failed procedures when attempting needle insertion.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Ultrasound guidance significantly raises the number of traumatic procedures when attempting needle insertion.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "Ultrasound guidance significantly reduces the number of failed procedures when attempting needle insertion.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Ultrasound guidance significantly reduces the number of needle insertion attempts necessary for a given procedure.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Ultrasound guidance significantly reduces the number of traumatic procedures when attempting needle insertion.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 24042311, "title": "Chronic Hypoxia Impairs Murine Hippocampal Development and Depletes the Postnatal Progenitor Pool by Attenuating Mammalian Target of Rapamycin Signaling", "abstract": "Chronic hypoxia (CH) is a major risk factor for impaired cognitive function in various disease states, particularly in the context of cyanotic congenital heart disease. Although most brain development occurs prenatally, the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus harbors progenitor stem cells that contribute to its ongoing development postnatally. It is unclear how exposure to CH might affect postnatal hippocampal development, so we used a transgenic mouse that expresses enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) within this progenitor population to determine the effect of CH on the DG. We find that exposure to 10% oxygen from postnatal d 3 to 28 results in a smaller DG with long-term impairment of hippocampal neurogenesis. Because the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is a well-known regulator of cell proliferation and growth and is sensitive to hypoxia, we investigated its activation on exposure to CH and find it to be attenuated specifically in neural progenitor cells. Systemic inhibition of the mTOR pathway using rapamycin also caused impairment of hippocampal neurogenesis that mimics exposure to CH. Our findings demonstrate that CH results in long-term impairment of hippocampal neurogenesis and is mediated, in part, by attenuation of the mTOR pathway.", "citation_paragraph": "any infants with cyanotic heart disease are in a state of chronic hypoxia (CH) for the first 2 to 3 y of life before repair of the cardiac lesion. CH that begins in these infants at birth occurs during critical time points of hippocampal development (1) . Using a rodent model of CH, we have previously shown a significant alteration in the hippocampal neurometabolome (2) and dendritic arborization in the hippocampus (3) . Given the significant alterations in the hippocampus in CH we investigated how dentate gyrus (DG) neurogenesis, which occurs primarily postnatally, might also be affected. The DG in the hippocampus is one of two well-characterized areas where neurogenesis is known to persist throughout life (4) . This region has stem/progenitor cells that are the source of the DG granular neurons (5, 6) .The neural stem and progenitor cells in the subgranular layer of the DG have been classified using a neural progenitorspecific nestin-GFP expressing transgenic mouse as type 1, 2a, 2b, and 3 cells (7, 8) . The early stem/progenitors (type 1 and 2a) express the neuroepithelial marker nestin, whereas the late progenitors (type 2b and 3) down-regulate the expression of nestin and begin to express markers of developing neurons such as the microtubule protein doublecortin (DCX) and polysialated neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) (8) . These cells are stimulated in response to environmental enrichment and various other physiological stimuli (9) . There is also evidence to suggest that subsets of these progenitor cells are vulnerable to external insults such as hypoxia-ischemia and trauma (10, 11) .We wanted to study the effects of CH on the progenitor stem cell population in the hippocampus and the underlying mechanism involved. To investigate the underlying mechanism of the effects of CH on neurogenesis, we examined the role of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, because hypoxia is an important regulator of the mTOR pathway. Under acute hypoxic conditions, cells regulate the limited energy available by inhibiting energy-intensive processes such as protein translation (12) . The inhibition of mTOR, a protein that is required for proper cell proliferation and growth, is the major mechanism through which this is achieved (13) . The mTOR pathway plays critical roles in proper brain development including axonal guidance, dendritic development, and dendritic morphogenesis (14, 15) . mTOR has also been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's Huntington's, and Parkinson's diseases (16 -18) .

{"s2orc_id": 16112572, "title": "PA28\u03b1\u03b2: The Enigmatic Magic Ring of the Proteasome?", "abstract": "PA28\u03b1\u03b2 is a \u03b3-interferon-induced 11S complex that associates with the ends of the 20S proteasome and stimulates in vitro breakdown of small peptide substrates, but not proteins or ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. In cells, PA28 also exists in larger complexes along with the 19S particle, which allows ATP-dependent degradation of proteins; although in vivo a large fraction of PA28 is present as PA28\u03b1\u03b2-20S particles whose exact biological functions are largely unknown. Although several lines of evidence strongly indicate that PA28\u03b1\u03b2 plays a role in MHC class I antigen presentation, the exact molecular mechanisms of this activity are still poorly understood. Herein, we review current knowledge about the biochemical and biological properties of PA28\u03b1\u03b2 and discuss recent findings concerning its role in modifying the spectrum of proteasome's peptide products, which are important to better understand the molecular mechanisms and biological consequences of PA28\u03b1\u03b2 activity.", "citation_paragraph": "In this respect, it is clear that a full understanding of the specific biochemical functions of PA28\u012e\u0215 requires quantitative information on the rates of protein substrate hydrolysis and generation of peptide products by PA28\u012e\u0215-containing immunoproteasomal species. To address this important issue, we recently performed a systematic analysis of the entire spectrum of peptides released during degradation of full-length proteins by PA28\u012e\u0215-20S immunoproteasomes [101] . PA28\u012e\u0215-20S particles were found to hydrolyze proteins at identical, slow rates compared to 20S proteasomes, and to generate higher amounts of very short products together with several longer peptides characterized by higher overall hydrophilicity.The finding that unstructured polypeptides are hydrolyzed at rates that are nearly 10-fold higher by 26S compared to 20S and PA28\u012e\u0215-20S immunoproteasomes is consistent with the notion that the free 20S particle is a relatively inactive protease since the N-terminal tails of its \u012e subunits obstruct the two opposite axial pores through which substrates access the internal catalytic lumen [94] . This autoinhibited state is relieved when the 20S core particle binds to activators such as 19S or PA28 that displace, in an ATP-dependent and independent manner, respectively, the N-terminal tails thereby opening an axial channel in the \u012e annulus [70, 71] . However, the latency of unliganded 20S proteasome is not absolute since, even in the absence of artificial treatments (e.g., heating or presence of low concentrations of detergents or chaotropic agents) that are known to activate it [10] , the 20S core particle degrades proteins at detectable and reproducible rates, probably involving transient and/or only partial channel opening [70, [76] [77] [78] . Surprisingly, despite the fact that the open-channel conformation of the gating residues induced by ATP-dependent and independent activators appears to be identical [105] , our data show that PA28\u012e\u0215-20S immunocomplexes hydrolyze proteins at the same rates as 20S immunoproteasomes, but much less efficiently than 26S immunoproteasomes. While on one hand this confirms initial reports on the biochemical properties of PA28 [19, 20, 65] , it is difficult to reconcile with the known role of the proteasomal gate in controlling accessibility of substrates into the lumen of the 20S particle. In fact, opening of the axial channel by deletion of the N-terminal tails of eukaryotic [70, 106] or archaeal [107] proteasomal \u012e subunits results in strong enhancement of the degradation rates of unfolded proteins, therefore suggesting that unstructured substrates can freely access the internal proteolytic chamber of the 20S particle simply by passive diffusion through a fully open gate. Furthermore, although it has been proposed that translocation of completely unstructured proteins might require a driving force produced by ATP hydrolysis [108] , subsequent studies demonstrated that once the polypeptide chain is unfolded its transit through the ATPases ring can occur by passive diffusion, in which retrograde movement is probably prevented by a Brownian ratchet mechanism [109] . In light of these data, the inability of PA28\u012e\u0215 to enhance hydrolysis rates of loosely folded proteins is surprising. It can be speculated that the presence of a supplementary multimeric ring, sitting at the proteasomal outer \u012e surface, might impose an extra constraint to the completely free diffusion of large, although linear, polypeptide chains into the internal proteasomal lumen. From this point of view, transit thorough the pore of open gate mutants might not perfectly reflect passage across the PA26/28 central channel. In fact, the crystal structure of PA28\u012e shows that the aqueous channel through the heptamer has a diameter of 20 \u00c5 at its minimum, which is theoretically wide enough for passage of unfolded proteins [34] . However, the homolog-specific inserts present between helices 1 and 2, which are not resolved in the crystal structure, most likely form a ring-like collar on the upper, non-proteasome binding surface of the PA28 heptamer. Although several studies have shown that these loops do not restrict passage of tri-or tetra-peptide fluorogenic substrates [35, 67] , recent investigations have demonstrated that they can hinder the transit of longer peptides, and conceivably of proteins as well, through the PA28 channel [44] . In fact, we demonstrated that 20S and PA28\u012e\u0215-20S immunoproteasomes hydrolyze proteins at exactly the same slow rates, which implies that denatured substrates transit through the partially or transiently open gate of unligated 20S and the fully open channel of PA28\u012e\u0215-20S particles with comparable efficiency. However, it cannot be excluded that PA28\u012e\u0215 might selectively enhance degradation of some specific substrates that are yet to be identified, as has been unambiguously demonstrated for PA28\u0216 [110] [111] [112] [113] .", "citance": "Furthermore, although it has been proposed that translocation of completely unstructured proteins might require a driving force produced by ATP hydrolysis [108] , subsequent studies demonstrated that once the polypeptide chain is unfolded its transit through the ATPases ring can occur by passive diffusion, in which retrograde movement is probably prevented by a Brownian ratchet mechanism [109] .", "claims": [{"text": "Unfolded poplypeptide chains can pass through the proteosomal ATPase ring by passive diffusion.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 45595653, "title": null, "abstract": null, "citation_paragraph": "A decade ago Sites and Marshall [1] described the empirical practice of species delimitation as \"a Renaissance issue in systematic biology\". At the time there was an odd disconnect between the two frequently stated empirical goals systematic biology: the discovery of: (1) monophyletic groups (clades) and relationships within these at all hierarchical levels above species; and (2) lineages (species); compared to the actual practice of the discipline. While much of systematic biology had been devoted to the first goal, the second goal had until recently been largely ignored [2] , despite the fact that species are routinely used as the basic units of analysis in biogeography, ecology, evolutionary biology, and conservation biology [3, 4] . However, Sites and Marshall [1] noted \"signs of a Renaissance\" at the time of their review, which was precipitated in part by others emphasizing the need to distinguish between a non-operational, ontological definition of species, versus the empirical (operational) data needed to test their reality [5] [6] [7] . De Queiroz [7] (p. 60) noted that \"All modern species definitions either explicitly or implicitly equate species with segments of population level evolutionary lineages.\" De Queiroz also noted that this was a revised version of Simpson's \"evolutionary species concept\", which defines a species as \"a lineage (an ancestral-descendent sequence of populations) evolving separately from others and with its own evolutionary role and tendencies\" ( [8] , p. 153), and called this a General Lineage Concept (GLC) of species ( [7] , p. 65). De Queiroz [9] further emphasized that the multiple empirical criteria simply reflect the many contingent properties (differences in genetic or morphological features, adaptive zones or ecological niches, mate-recognition systems, reproductive compatibility, monophyly, etc.) of diverging populations associated with different evolutionary processes operating in various geographic contexts [10, 11] . Sites and Marshall [1] noted that the emerging consensus among systematists and evolutionary biologists was based on the utility of this distinction (ontological definition vs. empirical species delimitation [SDL] meth-ods), and as also noted by de Queiroz [12] , due to the contingencies of speciation processes, any single criterion or data set will artificially reduce the complexity of evolving lineages.The subject matter of these and other reviews [12, 13] focused strictly on methods of detecting various lines of evidence for lineage independence (reproductive isolation, ecological distinctiveness, diagnosability, monophyly, etc.), and since then new methods continue to be described [14] , as do studies comparing the performance of some of these [14, 15] . In 2006, the Society of Systematic Biologists (SSB'06) organized the first symposium dedicated to the topic of species delimitation [2] ; 11 papers were presented and six of those published, including an update by referenced de Queiroz [16] , which emphasized the distinction between the GLC as \"separately evolving metapopulation lineages, or more specifically, with segments of such lineages\", versus secondary biological attributes or properties of organisms that can be quantified to empirically test for species status. This is a crucial distinction because it clearly separates the conceptual issue of defining the species category from the methodological issues of delimiting species; previously these had been conflated with the result that properties used to infer species boundaries (the empirical test) were also sometimes regarded as necessary for defining a species (a conceptualization issue). The advantage of the unified GLC is that no specific biological attributes of a species are considered necessary properties -species may exist as segments of metapopulations lineages regardless of our ability to empirically delimit them. Prior to this clarification and the realization that many different properties are relevant to the issue of species delimitation [17] , the alternative species \"concepts\" in which various biological attributes had accumulated in diverging lineages required these same attributes to be necessary properties of species. This led to a confusing situation in which a different property was considered necessary under each alternative concept (22 such \"concepts\" were identified by Mayden [6] ), and a long and ultimately non-productive debate about species definitions. Now most of these earlier \"concepts\" can be viewed as secondary species criteria that provide evidence of lineage separation.Recently, Hausdorf [17] argued for an up-dated ontological species concept, based in new insights into speciation processes, particularly evidence that reproductive barriers are semipermeable to some gene flow, and that speciation may occur despite ongoing gene flow between diverging populations [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Two other lines of evidence are relevant to the point of re-visiting the GLC: (1) findings of polyphyletic species of animals, due to parallel speciation in which similar traits conferring reproductive isolation arise separately in closely related populations [24, 25] , or in plants, due to recurrent polyploidization in different populations of the ancestral species [26, 27] ; and (2) discoveries of uniparental organisms that can be characterized as distinct units resembling species of biparental organisms [28] . We cannot resolve all of these larger issues here, but we return to some of the general points raised by Hausdorf [17] in the discussion. Figure 1A ). These increases include papers describing new SDL methods, or using existing methods with novel data sets and/or applications to new taxa. Because new SDL methods apply the same coalescent models developed for species tree estimation and usually lead to the discovery of morphologically 'cryptic' species, we also searched for references with the keywords 'species tree' and 'cryptic species'. During the same period of time, papers about 'species trees' were few until 2007, increased between 2008 and 2010 to 5-10 articles per year, and nearly doubled to >20 papers last year ( Figure 1B) . Publications referring to 'cryptic species' show a constant increase from 20 papers/year in 2000 to 90 papers/year in 2011 with the larger annual increase between 2010 and 2011 ( Figure 1C ). These publication trends suggest that the recent paradigm shift in phylogenetic systematics to incorporate species trees (29) is having a positive impact on the development of new SDL methods, which are gradually being incorporated into integrative taxonomic practices for the discovery of cryptic species diversity [30] .", "citance": "Two other lines of evidence are relevant to the point of re-visiting the GLC: (1) findings of polyphyletic species of animals, due to parallel speciation in which similar traits conferring reproductive isolation arise separately in closely related populations [24, 25] , or in plants, due to recurrent polyploidization in different populations of the ancestral species [26, 27] ; and (2) discoveries of uniparental organisms that can be characterized as distinct units resembling species of biparental organisms [28] .", "claims": [{"text": "Uniparental organisms are characterized as distinct units resembling species of biparental organisms.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}

With the progress that has been made in understanding the etiologies of these conditions in the past decade, potential therapeutic options have begun to move from the realm of improbability to initial stages of testing. Among these syndromes, relevant advances have recently been made in Werner syndrome, one of several progeroid syndromes characterized by defective DNA helicases, and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, which is characterized by aberrant processing of the nuclear envelope protein lamin A. Although best known for their causative roles in these illnesses, Werner protein and lamin A have also recently emerged as key players vulnerable to epigenetic changes that contribute to tumorigenesis and aging. These advances further demonstrate that understanding progeroid syndromes and introducing adequate treatments will not only prove beneficial to patients suffering from these dramatic diseases, but will also provide new mechanistic insights into cancer and normal aging processes.", "citation_paragraph": "Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome First described by Hutchinson in 1886 [2] and Gilford in 1904 [3] , the incidence of this condition is estimated at one in four to eight million live births [74] . HGPS (OMIM 176670) is characterized by alopecia, atherosclerosis, prominent scalp veins, deficiencies in storage of adipose tissue and a high-pitched voice, with death at approximately 13 years from atherosclerosis of the coronary and cerebrovascular arteries [74] . Having been the progeroid syndrome with one of the most perplexing etiologies, HGPS has paradoxically become one of the illnesses in which the greatest progress has been made since the discovery of a recurring lamin A defect by two independent groups in 2003 [75, 76] . LMNA is a gene differentially expressed and spliced to produce the nuclear intermediate filament proteins lamins A and C, with lamin C being the shorter transcript [77] . Lamins share a general structure, which includes a short N-terminal domain, \u03b1 helical rod domain and a C-terminal globular tail domain (Fig. 1) , and serve many direct and indirect roles in the maintenance of nuclear structure, gene expression, chromatin organization, cell cycle regulation and apoptosis [78, 79] . Lamin A belongs to a class of proteins with a conserved C-terminal CaaX (a, aliphatic; X, one among S, M, C, A or Q) motif, which is a potential target for subsequent processing steps. To generate mature lamin A, prelamin A undergoes substantial post-translational modification of its CaaX motif, which includes farnesylation of the cysteine by farnesyltransferase, cleavage of the aaX amino acids most likely by the FACE-1/ZMPSTE24 metalloproteinase, carboxymethylation of the farnesylated cysteine by prenylcysteine carboxymethyltransferase and, finally, a second cleavage of the 15 terminal residues also by FACE-1/ZMPSTE24 (Fig. 3 ) [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] . Mutations in LMNA had been previously found in a variety of human syndromes, such as muscular dystrophies, lipodystrophies and neuropathies [24, [86] [87] [88] .In approximately 80% of HGPS cases, a de novo silent mutation (G608G: GGC \u2192 GGT) in LMNA activates a cryptic donor splice site and eliminates 150 bp of exon 11. While the C-terminal CaaX motif required for farnesylation is retained, the signal directing the second cleavage by FACE-1/ZMPSTE24 is not, resulting in a truncated isoform of prelamin A called progerin which can- Review Article 161 not be cleaved by this metalloprotease and consequently remains farnesylated [75, 76] . Remarkably, a mutation affecting the cleavage site by FACE-1/ZMPSTE24 (R644C) has been identified in an atypical form of this syndrome, although the effect of this mutation over the second proteolytic maturation event of prelamin A has not been experimentally explored [89] . Other HGPS mutations that have been described in LMNA include E145K, R471C, R527C, G608S, T623S and 1824C > T (Fig. 1 ) [76, [89] [90] [91] . The toxic accumulation of progerin at the nuclear envelope of HGPS patient cells has been regarded as the primary cause of nuclear shape abnormalities and chromatin stress leading to premature cell death [92] . Affected cells frequently exhibit nuclear herniations, or 'blebbing,' which have commonly been quantified to assess the extent of HGPS and HGPS-like phenotypes [93] [94] [95] [96] . While the mechanism by which progerin induces nuclear lamina and envelope deformities is not fully understood, it has been suggested that the farnesyl group of progerin interacts preferentially with normally isoprenylated lamin B1, disrupting the normal distribution of lamins that contribute to nuclear structure [97] . An early theory to explain why these deformities result in premature cell death is that nuclei are more susceptible to mechanical stress and damage when lamin A is compromised, as has been observed in lamin A/C-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) [98, 99] . In light of these data, it is particularly interesting that a mouse model created to express only lamin C is virtually normal, despite the absence of both lamin A and prelamin A [100] . These results underscore the importance of aberrant prelamin A -and not merely the insufficiency of normal protein -to the development of disease phenotypes. Interestingly, HGPS cells have been reported to be as resistant to acute mechanical stress as normal cells, suggesting that the nuclear fragility characteristic of lamin A/C deficient MEFs is not present in HGPS patient cells [101] . The altered arrangement of Aand B-type lamins in the nuclear lamina may contribute to differences in mechanosensitive gene expression and responses to mechanical stress. However, cells from patients with other progeroid syndromes, including WS, exhibit similarly deformed nuclear phenotypes, perhaps indicating that a structural theory may be incomplete for explaining the source of nuclear fragility and damage [102] . Thus, it has been suggested that generalized DNA damage may be sufficient to induce the altered cellular traits for reasons that are currently not completely understood [103] . In addition to the theory of mechanical stress, aberrantly processed farnesylated prelamin A has been proposed to act in a dominant negative manner, affecting DNA damage response and repair. As mice deficient in Zmpste24 extensively phenocopy HGPS in humans, this model has been useful in evaluat- Transcription from a wild-type LMNA locus yields normal pre-RNA that is correctly spliced to produce prelamin A mRNA. In HGPS cells, a silent C to T transition at nt1284 introduces a cryptic splicing site, and the deletion of a 150-nt region from exon 11 yields the aberrant progerin mRNA. Prelamin A is a CaaX prenylated protein that undergoes three additional post-translational modifications after farnesylation: proteolytic removal of the C-terminal -aaX tripeptide (grey arrowhead indicates the cleavage site), carboxymethylation of the newly exposed C-terminal cysteine and, finally, a second proteolytic step (black arrowhead indicates the cleavage site), producing mature lamin A. Although FACE-1/ZMPSTE24 protease is necessary for the second proteolytic step, it is also most likely involved in the first step. Therefore, cells lacking FACE-1/ZMPSTE24 cannot complete lamin A maturation and accumulate toxic prelamin A. On the other hand, progerin lacks 50 amino acids including the cleavage site for the second proteolytic event, thus making its correct processing to produce mature lamin A impossible. Progeroid syndromes, aging and cancer ing the adverse effects of farnesylated prelamin A [84, 85] . Although progerin and farnesylated prelamin A are derived differently (Fig. 3) and are molecularly distinct, they appear to affect cells similarly. Zmpste24-null MEFs and fibroblasts from HGPS patients are more sensitive to DNA-damaging agents and exhibit impaired recruitment of p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1), leading to defective repair and a delayed checkpoint response [104] . At the organismal level, advances have been made in understanding why a predisposition to cancer is not common to HGPS and why HGPS patients often succumb to atherosclerosis. In a Zmpste24-null mouse model, we have observed that increased activation of a p53-linked pathway is correlated with severity of the accelerated aging phenotype [105] . In accordance with the theory of antagonistic pleiotropy, the up-regulation of the p53 pathway and related molecular events would lead to cancer resistance at the expense of eliminating damaged cells less selectively, resulting in a significantly shortened lifespan marked by senescent cells and accelerated organismal aging [106] . In addition, HGPS patients are particularly susceptible to vascular disease, and a direct link between progerin expression and atherosclerosis was recently explored [107] . Skin biopsy sections from a subject with HGPS were probed with anti-LMNA G608G antibody, resulting in the observation that progerin accumulates primarily in the nuclei of vascular cells. The complementary work of Varga et al. [108] in a progerinexpressing mouse model of HGPS has demonstrated the loss of vascular smooth muscle cells, accumulation of acellular material and calcification of vessel walls over time. Although human progerin is expressed in a variety of these transgenic mice tissues, vascular smooth muscle cells are the most heavily affected, as these mice do not have the dramatically shortened lifespan of their human counterparts.", "citance": "In accordance with the theory of antagonistic pleiotropy, the up-regulation of the p53 pathway and related molecular events would lead to cancer resistance at the expense of eliminating damaged cells less selectively, resulting in a significantly shortened lifespan marked by senescent cells and accelerated organismal aging [106] .", "claims": [{"text": "Up-regulation of the p53 pathway and related molecular events casues cancer resistance and results in a significantly shortened lifespan marked by senescent cells and accelerated organismal aging.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Up-regulation of the p53 pathway and related molecular events speeds cancer progression.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}

Literature published in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Direct electronic databases was searched and reviewed. Liquid biopsy specially referred to the detection of nucleic acids (circulating cell-free DNA, cfDNA) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the blood of cancer patients. Compared to conventional single-site sampling or biopsy method, liquid biopsy had the advantages such as non-invasiveness, dynamic monitoring, and the most important of all, overcoming the limit of spatial and temporal heterogeneity. The genomic information of cancer could be profiled by genotyping cfDNA/CTC and subsequently applied to make molecular classification, targeted therapy guidance, and unveil drug resistance mechanisms. The serial sampling feature of liquid biopsy made it possible to monitor treatment response in a real-time manner and predict tumor metastasis/recurrence in advance. Liquid biopsy is a non-invasive, dynamic, and informative sampling method with important clinical translational significance in cancer research and practice. Much work needs to be done before it is used in the management of HCC.", "citation_paragraph": "For advanced diseases, chemotherapy and targeted monoclonal antibodies or inhibitors are commonly used as first-line treatment; however, drug resistance often occurs, leading to treatment failure. The mechanisms of oncological drug resistance are largely unknown because repeated biopsies to study genomic evolution following therapy are difficult, invasive, and limited by heterogeneity. However, liquid biopsy provides some information that solid tumor tissue cannot. In NSCLC patients harboring activating somatic mutations in EGFR, TKIs such as gefitinib and erlotinib are effective at initial treatment; however, acquired resistance usually develops after a median of 9-14 months [88, 89] . Though a few EGFR mutations in plasma DNA have been detected prior to treatment [76] , the presence of which can predict tumor response in NSCLC patients [90] , de novo mutations of KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF and amplification of Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2) and MET might drive resistance to anti-EGFR treatment. Sequencing plasma DNA before and after the development of drug resistance indicates that, upon developing TKI resistance, new mutations in EGFR, such as a C797S mutation, emerge, and cause treatment failure [91] . Similarly, the detection of T790M mutation in CTCs from patients with EGFR mutations who have received TKIs is predictive of reduced progression-free survival [92] .Despite the prevalence of newly-acquired mutations that confer resistance to treatment, pre-existing rare clones within the primary tumor can also result in cancer refractory to anti-EGFR treatment. Measurement of KRAS and EGFR mutation status in plasma DNA of posttreatment mCRC patients indicates that drug resistance-associated mutants are indeed derived from rare, pre-existing clones in the primary tumors [93] . Though these mutants occur at very low frequencies prior to EGFR blockade therapy, they become evident 22 weeks after initiation of treatment, the time interval required for the mutant subclone to repopulate the lesion and lead to recurrence [94] . As a result, evaluating the serial plasma DNA mutation status during monoclonal antibody treatment suggests that combination therapies targeting multiple pathways and timely adjustments of therapeutic regimens can delay or prevent disease progression [95] .Furthermore, quantitative and genetic characterization of CTCs can also guide treatment choice. A decrease in total CTCs suggests response to therapy and predicts longer overall survival in lung cancer patients [96] , whereas an increase in CTCs after chemotherapy is associated with shorter overall survival in patients with breast cancer and CRC [97, 98] . The positive HER2 status of CTCs in breast cancer patients whose primary tumors were HER2-negative indicates a benefit from trastuzumab therapy [99] . Moreover, the results from the SWOG 0500 trial found that for breast cancer patients with persistently increased CTCs after 21 days of first-line chemotherapy, an early switch to an alternative cytotoxic therapy was not effective in prolonging overall survival, indicating that this population needs more effective treatment than standard chemotherapy [100] .", "citance": "Sequencing plasma DNA before and after the development of drug resistance indicates that, upon developing TKI resistance, new mutations in EGFR, such as a C797S mutation, emerge, and cause treatment failure [91] .", "claims": [{"text": "Upon developing tyrosine-kinase inhibitor resistance, new mutations in epidermal growth factor receptors emerge and cause treatment failure.

Transcriptome analyses were done comparing gene regulation of TFH and TFR cells isolated from Peyer's Patches (PP) and immunized peripheral lymph nodes (pLNs) revealing many regulatory patterns common to all follicular cells. However, in contrast to TFH cells, the upregulation or downregulation of many genes was attenuated substantially in pLN TFR cells when compared to those of PP. Additionally, PP but not pLN TFR cells were largely unresponsive to IL2 and expressed Il4 as well as Il21. Together with fundamental differences in gene expression that were found between cells of both compartments this emphasizes specific adaptations of follicular T cell functions to their micro-milieu. Moreover, although GL7 expression distinguishes matured follicular T cells, GL7+ as well as GL7- cells are present in the GC.", "citation_paragraph": "In search for genes important for differentiation and/or function of TFH and TFR cells, we focused on those displaying differential expression patterns compared to na\u00efve CD4 T or Treg cells in PP and immunized pLN. This approach inherently neglects all genes where expression remains unchanged during follicular T cell development but nevertheless is important for TFH or TFR biology. Moreover, we investigated the transcriptomes of follicular T cells at rather late time points following immunization (d12 and d25) and not at earlier days (approximately at d7) as done in many other studies. We had chosen later time points for two reasons: (i) although detectable already at d6, we observed a separate and easy to gate PD1 hi GL7 + population only at later time points and (ii) available data from literature indicated that upon immunization, the mass of TFR cells comes into existence later than the TFH cells (47, 52) . Furthermore, we considered it important to apply a restrictive gating to focus on cells in most advanced stages of the follicular T cell pathway and to avoid contamination with cell types that express PD1 at intermediate levels (e.g., preTFH cells, exhausted cells) or that exist in pLN already in steady state (activated Treg cells). This strategy was corroborated by the results following photo conversion of GC resident T cells, i.e., fully mature follicular cells, showing that the vast majority were PD1hi cells according to the gate criteria applied here. Apart from well-studied genes central to TFH/TFR biology, we identified a collection of genes displaying a regulation that would bring in line their known effects in T cells with those required for follicular T cell development and/or function. For example, upmodulation was observed for Ptpn11 (SHP2, Figure 1E ) that mediates the inhibitory activity of PD1 (53) . Upregulation of PD1 correlated with downmodulation of Satb1 coding a chromatin organizer that represses PD1 expression in T cells (54) . A concomitant expression of PD1 and other inhibitory receptors (e.g., Ctla4, Btla, Cd160, Tigit; Figure 2 ) over extended periods of time is associated with T cell exhaustion that would lead to a loss of effector functions in the long run (55) . Exhaustion is provoked by a persistent antigen driven stimulation as met by T cells in the GC. Remarkably, exhausted CD4 T cells exist that produce IL10 as well as IL21 and that express BCL6. In CD8 T cells, expression of Stx11 (syntaxin 11) that was upregulated in TFH and TFR cells, counteracts exhaustion (56) . A trait follicular T cells may share with TH2 cells is the specific expression of Ptpn13 (FAP-1) that limits Fas/FasL-mediated apoptosis (57) . Gadd45b (MyD118) expression is rapidly induced upon activation of CD4 T cells and its deficiency impairs cytokine production (58) . Tbc1d4 encodes a Rab GTPase-activating protein involved in regulation of glucose uptake. A concurrent upregulation of Hif1a was found. HIF1\u03b1 is a key factor regulating metabolism by upregulating expression of genes engaged in glycolysis (59) . This was surprising because BCL6 was shown to suppress the expression of genes of the glycolysis program in effector T cells (60) and glucose metabolism of TFH cells is considerably reduced compared to TH1 cells (61) . By contrast, we observed a marked upregulation of BCL6 target genes such as Tpi1 (triosephoshate isomerase), Gapdh, or Pfkl (phosphofructokinase) in follicular T cells compared to na\u00efve CD4 and Treg cells ( Figure 2B) suggesting that HIF1\u03b1 may override BCL6 mediated repression in these particular cases. Evidence was provided that aerobic glycolysis is required for efficient cytokine production by T cells (62) and an ongoing substantial glucose metabolism driven by HIF1\u03b1 is further indicated by the notion that Mafg, a small MAF protein facilitating nuclear localization of HIF1A (63) is upregulated in follicular cells.The results presented here revealed that the magnitude of gene regulation was very similar between TFH cells of PP and pLN although some variations and micro-milieu triggered divergences existed. Much more profound differences existed between the TFR cells of both compartments and one key feature of PP TFR cells is the almost complete absence of Il2ra expression and a concomitant unresponsiveness to IL2. It was found recently that signature genes (e.g., Bcl6, Pdcd1, and Btla) were less well up-modulated in CD25+ TFR cells suggesting that they represent an intermediate stage whereas CD25\u2212 cells are matured GC resident TFR cells (47) . Accordingly, we observed that regulation of some genes (e.g., Klf2, Tbc1d4) tended to completion at d25 but others did not follow such a scheme (e.g., Cxcr5, Hif1a) and also the signal for Il2ra remained high among d25 pLN TFR cells arguing against a progress in differentiation toward CD25 lo TFR cells. However, in pLN new Treg cells may be recruited continuously into the TFR pathway generating immature CD25+ cells, a process that would then not occur efficiently in PP in steady state with its well established chronic GC. At any rate, the existence of a high rate of CD25 hi cells discriminated the pool of TFR cells of pLN from those of PP. In addition, only the latter were found to express Il4 and Il21 substantially and along with other noticeable differences (e.g., Vdr, Fut7, Ccr6, Nrn1) this gives rise to profound functional disparities. Thus, most activated B cells in PP would perform a switch to IgA that is propelled mainly by TGF\u03b2 but also other factors such as IL10, RA, and IL21 (64) . Efficient IgA class switch takes place outside the GC in the SED that is rich in TGF\u03b2-producing DC (65) . To accomplish migration to the SED and interaction with DC, preGC B cells must express CCR6. Interestingly, we observed that pLN but not PP TFR cells prominently expressed this chemokine receptor. Therefore, in PP the IgA class switching cells might escape a fine-meshed control by TFR cells as met in the GC.Notably, a temporal asymmetry exists regarding GC performance in periphery: at early time points, a broader spectrum of GC B cells with regard to antigen affinity as well as more memory B cells are generated whereas later on preferentially high affinity plasma cells are formed (66) . Considering a delay in numbers and maturity, this would fit to a role of TFR cells suppressing GC B cell responses where only high affinity B cells would be able to overrule the increasing inhibition at later stages of the GC reaction (67) . If this hypothesis is correct, it would be difficult to reconcile the role of the rather mature PP TFR cells with the commonly accepted scenario that the commensal microbiota-driven (chronic) GC responses in the PP would allow continuous generation of low-affinity GC B cells (64) . However, we found that PP but not pLN TFR cells are capable to produce IL4 and IL21 although this contradicts their classical role, i.e., suppressing production of these cytokines by TFH cells (20) . Of note, TFH-born IL4 efficiently drives plasma cell differentiation (68) and IL21endowes GC B cells to overcome an imprinted inhibition of propagation by TFR cells (69) . We, therefore, speculate that by using these unique features PP TFR cells permit to some extent the proliferation of low-affinity GC B cells directly contacting them. For this purpose, also moderate levels of IL21production could be effective since the cytokine would be available at higher local concentrations at the cell surface. Possibly, this also fuels autocrine mediated signaling. IL21 augments expression of Bcl6 that in turn impairs that of CD25 (70), a mechanism that may reinforce the more matured phenotype of PP TFR cells. Moreover, our observation of propagation incompetent CD25\u2212 IL4 + IL21+ TFR cells could help explain why TFR cells of PP but not those of periphery can readily convert into TFH cells because they anticipate these TFH key features (24) .Taken together, our results unraveled may new aspects in TFH and TFR cell biology. This applies to genes of general relevance for follicular T cell function such as Hif1a, Il4, Il21, or the GL7 epitope but also genes supporting local peculiarities in function (e.g., Ccr6, Asb2, Il2ra, integrins and modulators of integrin function, Fut7). Interestingly, we discovered also genes that are more actively expressed in either of the TFH and TFR follicular subtypes, respectively, and also a wealth of interesting candidate genes. However, the importance of these genes for follicular T cell biology awaits experimental validation although we were able to document an influence of Sostdc1 on efficiency of memory B cell generation in PP.", "citance": "Upregulation of PD1 correlated with downmodulation of Satb1 coding a chromatin organizer that represses PD1 expression in T cells (54) .", "claims": [{"text": "Upregulation of PD1 causes the downmodulation of Satb1.", "subject": "Upregulation of PD1", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "Upregulation of PD1 causes the upregulation of Satb1.", "subject": "Upregulation of PD1", "is_negation": true}]}

This metabolic reorganization has been recognized as a hallmark of cancer. The increased uptake of glucose and the increased activity of the glycolytic pathway have been extensively described. However, over the past years, increasing evidence has shown that lung cancer cells also require glutamine to fulfill their metabolic needs. As a nitrogen source, glutamine contributes directly (or indirectly upon conversion to glutamate) to many anabolic processes in cancer, such as the biosynthesis of amino acids, nucleobases, and hexosamines. It plays also an important role in the redox homeostasis, and last but not least, upon conversion to \u03b1-ketoglutarate, glutamine is an energy and anaplerotic carbon source that replenishes tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates. The latter is generally indicated as glutaminolysis. In this review, we explore the role of glutamine metabolism in lung cancer. Because lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death with limited curative treatment options, we focus on the potential therapeutic approaches targeting the glutamine metabolism in cancer.", "citation_paragraph": "As previously mentioned, the overexpression of glutamine transporters accounts for the increased uptake of glutamine by lung cancer cells. The inhibition of glutamine transport is another strategy to for restricting glutamine metabolism. Pharmacological targeting of the ASCT2 receptor in lung cancer patients by \u03b3-L-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide (GPNA) only led to glutamine starvation in cells with ASCT2 overexpression [82] . In this context, the pretreatment evaluation of glutamine uptake by ASCT2, using positron emission tomography with labeled glutamine-analogues, may select patients that benefit from GPNA treatment [89] . In preclinical pharmacological trials, V-9302, another competitive antagonist of the transmembrane glutamine flux, has not only demonstrated attenuated growth and proliferation, but it also increased cell death and oxidative stress which resulted in antitumor responses [83] . Limitation of the glutamine import, not only influences glutamine metabolism, but it also decreases the mTORC1 signaling, resulting in a decrease of lung cancer proliferation. mTORC1 is a signaling node that regulates several processes such as mRNA translation, cell cycle progression, and autophagy. In the absence of glutamine, the exchange of intracellular glutamine, coupled with the import of essential amino acids becomes compromised. As these amino acids are the rate-limiting step for mTORC1 activation, the inhibition of ASCT2 also results in the silencing of this signaling pathway. As a consequence of ASCT2 inhibition, the lower concentration of glutamate also results in the lower concentrations of ammonia, thereby inhibiting the cytoprotective process of autophagy in malignant cells. Another way to inhibit the mTOR pathway activity, by targeting the LAT1 receptor, is the direct inhibition of leucine import by 2-aminobicyclo-(2,2,1)-heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH) [28] . More recently, experimental targeting of the xCT (SLC7A11) receptor with sulfasalazine, an approved drug in the treatment of inflammatory bowel and rheumatic diseases, resulted in a decreased cell proliferation in several cell lines, and in mice [29] . These results provide evidence for targeting the cystine-glutamate transporter.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been shown to upregulate this gene upon infection of cell lines, but the timing and mechanism of this upregulation, as well as its importance to EBV infection, remain unknown. This work investigated EBV's manipulation of EBI2 expression of primary naive B cells. EBV infection induces EBI2 expression resulting in elevated levels of EBI2 after 24 h until 7 days post-infection, followed by a dramatic decline (P=0.027). Increased EBI2 expression was not found in non-specifically stimulated B cells or when irradiated virus was used. The EBV lytic gene BRRF1 exhibited a similar expression pattern to EBI2 (R2=0.4622). BRRF1-deficient EBV could not induce EBI2. However, B cells transduced with BRRF1 showed elevated expression of EBI2 (P=0.042), a result that was not seen with transduction of a different EBV lytic transfection factor, BRLF1. Based on these results, we conclude that EBI2 expression is directly influenced by EBV infection and that BRRF1 is necessary and sufficient for EBI2 upregulation during infection.", "citation_paragraph": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a human B-lymphotropic herpes virus, infects over 90 % of adults [1] [2] [3] . Primary EBV infection usually occurs in childhood [4] . Although most infections are asymptomatic, delayed infection into adolescence commonly causes infectious mononucleosis [5, 6] . In this case, the virus is spread via saliva and infects permissive epithelial cells of the oropharynx [7] . During this time, the virus also infects mucosal B cells. Once B cells are infected, the virus enters a stage of latency. This results in the expansion of an lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL)-like population of B lymphocytes in the tonsils [8] . This also allows for the virus to avoid immune detection and remain with the host for the rest of their life, persisting in the B-lymphocyte population. Infection with EBV is also associated with and suspected of being responsible for several types of cancers [9] . It is a strongly associated agent of Burkitt's lymphoma, as well as various types of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, nasopharyngeal carcinoma and immunoproliferative disorders, and is associated as an environmental trigger in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Post-infection (p.i.), EBV is adept at controlling lymphocyte gene expression, likely manipulating EBV-induced gene 2 (EBI2) expression, among others, as a means of controlling B-lymphocyte migration. However, after a time, the virus lowers the expression of most viral genes and enters a latent state.Following the establishment of latency, it is possible for EBV to reactivate due to environmentally induced stimulation. This is a problem of particular concern during tissue and organ transplants and can result in post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease [15] . Key to this process of reactivation are the various EBV lytic transcription factors, mainly BZLF1, BRLF1 and BRRF1, that assist in initiating the cascade of transcription needed to achieve viral lytic replication [16, 17] . These and various other EBV genes can also be transiently expressed early after infection. This transient expression of EBV genes before latency is often called pre-latency [18] . Prelatency is thought to be important for viral immune evasion as various pre-latently expressed proteins assist in immune avoidance by suppressing intracellular and extracellular detection.EBI2 is a member of the rhodopsin-like subfamily of seventransmembrane G protein-coupled receptors. Sequence alignments have grouped EBI2 with lipid receptors, and it shows highest similarity with GPR18 [19, 20] . EBI2 expression is found to be naturally highest in secondary lymphoid tissues [20, 21] . The natural ligand of EBI2 is an oxysterol, 7a,25-dihydroxycholesterol (7a,25-OHC), which is expressed primarily in secondary lymph tissue by stromal cells. Chemotaxis of naive B cells within the follicle is mediated through the expression of EBI2, CCR7 and CXCR5. Varying expression levels of EBI2 affect the positioning and migration of the B cells throughout the follicle [22] [23] [24] . When EBI2 expression is highest, the B cell migrates to the outer areas of the B-cell follicles [22] . Likewise, low levels of EBI2 expression lead B cells to accumulate in the Follicular dendritic cell (FDC)-dense region in the centre of the follicle or the interface of the T-cell zone [23] . These expression patterns are kept in a fine balance as positioning within the follicle, which directly affects both Bcell proliferation and differentiation [25] .EBV controls expression of EBI2 upon infection. This control could affect EBV-infected cells in several ways. These include B-cell chemotaxis, improper positioning of B cells within the follicle and immune deficiency or other disruptions to cell haematopoiesis and function [26] . Altered positioning and chemotaxis of B cells is also thought to be necessary for the development and progression of lymphomas [27] . Understanding how EBV controls lymphocyte positioning could allow for improved control of infection and response to EBV-induced malignancies. To enhance our understanding of EBV infection, we investigated the expression profile of EBI2 during EBV infection and potential viral mechanisms responsible for tampering with EBI2 expression.", "citance": "Varying expression levels of EBI2 affect the positioning and migration of the B cells throughout the follicle [22] [23] [24] .", "claims": [{"text": "Varying expression levels of EBI2 affect the positioning and migration of B cells.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 8484670, "title": "Type VI secretion systems of human gut Bacteroidales segregate into three genetic architectures, two of which are contained on mobile genetic elements", "abstract": "BACKGROUND Type VI secretion systems (T6SSs) are contact-dependent antagonistic systems employed by Gram negative bacteria to intoxicate other bacteria or eukaryotic cells. T6SSs were recently discovered in a few Bacteroidetes strains, thereby extending the presence of these systems beyond Proteobacteria. The present study was designed to analyze in a global nature the diversity, abundance, and properties of T6SSs in the Bacteroidales, the most predominant Gram negative bacterial order of the human gut.   RESULTS By performing extensive bioinformatics analyses and creating hidden Markov models for Bacteroidales Tss proteins, we identified 130 T6SS loci in 205 human gut Bacteroidales genomes. Of the 13 core T6SS proteins of Proteobacteria, human gut Bacteroidales T6SS loci encode orthologs of nine, and an additional five other core proteins not present in Proteobacterial T6SSs. The Bacteroidales T6SS loci segregate into three distinct genetic architectures with extensive DNA identity between loci of a given genetic architecture. We found that divergent DNA regions of a genetic architecture encode numerous types of effector and immunity proteins and likely include new classes of these proteins. TheT6SS loci of genetic architecture 1 are contained on highly similar integrative conjugative elements (ICEs), as are the T6SS loci of genetic architecture 2, whereas the T6SS loci of genetic architecture 3 are not and are confined to Bacteroides fragilis. Using collections of co-resident Bacteroidales strains from human subjects, we provide evidence for the transfer of genetic architecture 1 T6SS loci among co-resident Bacteroidales species in the human gut. However, we also found that established ecosystems can harbor strains with distinct T6SS of all genetic architectures.   CONCLUSIONS This is the first study to comprehensively analyze of the presence and diversity of T6SS loci within an order of bacteria and to analyze T6SSs of bacteria from a natural community. These studies demonstrate that more than half of our gut Bacteroidales, equivalent to about \u00bc of the bacteria of this ecosystem, encode T6SSs. The data reveal several novel properties of these systems and suggest that antagonism between or distributed defense among these abundant intestinal bacteria may be common in established human gut communities.", "citation_paragraph": "The human intestinal microbiota contains more than 35 species of the order Bacteroidales that are collectively the most abundant Gram negative bacteria of this ecosystem. These species co-colonize the human intestine at very high density [1] [2] [3] [4] and form stable ecosystems [4] , with strains persisting for years or decades. The coresidence, high abundance, and long term colonization by the Bacteroidales suggest that they may form mutualistic relationships that stabilize the community. In addition, as newly introduced strains are rarely able to become established, there are likely antagonistic mechanisms employed by these strains to compete and defend the ecosystem from invasion. Relatively few studies have analyzed interactions between predominant human gut Bacteroidales strains. Gut Bacteroidales are equipped with large arsenals of proteins that allow them to harvest a tremendous array of different plant polysaccharides and host-derived glycans (reviewed [5] ). We have shown that Bacteroidales strains form complex ecological networks based on the breakdown and utilization of dietary polysaccharides, such that some strains that cannot access a certain polysaccharide can be cross-fed by other Bacteroidales strains able to utilize the polysaccharide [6] . These interactions benefit at least one interacting member, likely without harm to either partner. We have also shown that competitive interactions via direct antagonism occur among Bacteroidales strains. Gut Bacteroidales secrete antibacterial proteins, designated BSAPs, one of which we have shown does not require a cognate immunity protein and targets closely related strains [7] . As bacteria use many different mechanisms to compete in microbial communities, and the gut microbiota is an extremely dense ecosystem, we predicted that contact dependent Type VI secretion systems (T6SSs) are likely very prevalent antagonistic systems of the gut Bacteroidales.T6SSs are toxin delivery systems that until recently were only described in Proteobacterial species. The T6SS apparatus is a multiprotein complex requiring numerous core proteins (Tss proteins) including cytoplasmic, transmembrane, and outer membrane components [8, 9] . The needle or tube apparatus is comprised of a phagelike complex, similar to the T4 contractile bacteriophage tail, which is thought to be anchored to the membrane by a trans-envelope complex. These tube and transenvelope sub-assemblies are linked via TssK [10] . The inner tube is comprised of Hcp (TssD) that assemble as stacked hexamers [11] . The VgrG (TssI) protein sits at the tip of the tube and forms a spike (in some cases, sharpened by a PAAR protein [12] ), which enables puncturing of the recipient's membranes. Toxic effectors are loaded onto the tube/spike apparatus by interacting with Hcp or VgrG [13] [14] [15] . The inner tube is surrounded by a sheath comprised of TssB and TssC that contracts [16, 17] , driving expulsion of the inner tube from the cell. Current models suggest that this T6SS firing delivers the contents of the inner tube either into the supernatant of in vitro grown bacteria, or punctures the membrane of a neighboring bacterial or eukaryotic cell thereby delivering the toxic contents. Following T6SS firing, components of the T6SS machinery are recycled using energy provided by the ATPase ClpV (TssH) [18, 19] . T6SS effectors include cell wall degrading enzymes, proteins that affect cell membranes (phospholipases, pore-forming), and nucleases [20] . In most cases, the effector is produced with a cognate immunity protein, typically encoded by an adjacent gene [21] . Both eukaryotic and bacterial cells are targeted by T6SS effectors (reviewed [22] ) although most described T6SS effectors target Gram negative bacteria.T6SSs were only recently identified in Bacteroidetes species [23] [24] [25] and this lapse was due to the fact that many proteins of the few identified Bacteroidetes T6SS do not share sufficient sequence similarity with core T6SS proteins of Proteobacteria to be detectable by methods that rely on protein-protein comparisons (e.g. blastp) or protein-profile comparisons (e.g. Pfam, COG). Using more sensitive profile-profile and profile-structural comparisons, we identified a T6SS locus contained on an integrative conjugative element (ICE), and showed that it was transferred between four different Bacteroidales species while co-resident in a human gut [23] . This was the first demonstration of a T6SS locus being transferred between members of a natural microbial community. A concurrent study showed functional T6SSs in two Bacteroidetes species [24] . The soil organism Flavobacterium johnsonii was shown to have T6SS proteins that function analogously to their Proteobacterial counterparts, and an effector and its cognate immunity protein were identified. In addition, a T6SS of Bacteroides fragilis was shown to antagonize a Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron strain in vitro [24] . The Bacteroidetes T6SSs are distinct enough from the general Proteobacterial T6SS loci (T6SS i ) and the Francisella T6SSs (T6SS ii ) that they have been designated a separate subtype (T6SS iii ) (24) . In the present study, we build upon these early findings and provide a comprehensive analysis of the prevalence and properties of T6SS loci of the human gut Bacteroidales.", "citance": "The VgrG (TssI) protein sits at the tip of the tube and forms a spike (in some cases, sharpened by a PAAR protein [12] ), which enables puncturing of the recipient's membranes.", "claims": [{"text": "VgrG (Tssl) protein punctures membranes by forming a spike at the tip of the tube apparatus.", "subject": "VgrG (Tssl) protein", "is_negation": false}]}

OBJECTIVE The objective of the study was to investigate the relationship between dietary calcium intake and bone mineral density (BMD) or bone geometry in an Asian population with low calcium intake.   DESIGN AND SETTING This was a cross-sectional study of data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2008-2010.   PARTICIPANTS A total of 3448 men and 3812 women older than 50 years were stratified by daily dietary calcium intake: less than 400 mg/d, 400-799 mg/d, 800-1199 mg/d, and 1200 mg/d or greater.   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES BMD was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and the geometric index was calculated.   RESULTS Mean daily calcium intake was 470 mg/d in this population. BMD in the lumbar spine (both sexes) and femoral neck (women) was significantly lower only when calcium intake was less than 400 mg/d. In men, femoral neck and total hip BMD was positively related to calcium intake up to 1200 mg/d. Calcium intake less than 400 mg/d was negatively related to femoral cortical thickness and buckling ratio. These interactions disappeared when the 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was 30 ng/mL or greater in men and 20 ng/mL or greater in women.   CONCLUSIONS Low calcium intake was significantly related with low BMD and increased risk of osteoporosis. However, the association between calcium and BMD was not consistently linear, and a sufficient vitamin D level appears to compensate for the negative influences of low calcium intake on bone.", "citation_paragraph": "intake is an important factor related to the latter (3). Calcium is an essential nutrient for skeletal health, and the relationship between calcium intake and bone density or bone strength has been analyzed widely (4, 5) . It has been well documented that maintaining adequate calcium intake is essential for adequate accrual of bone mass during childhood and adolescence (6) . Several studies have also proven the beneficial effects of calcium on bone strength in the decades after the achievement of peak bone mass. For example, low dietary calcium intake is associated with low bone density, and calcium supplementation can attenuate age-related bone loss (4, 7) . Therefore, calcium supplementation is generally recommended for people who might be at risk of inadequate dietary calcium intake or osteoporosis, regardless of age, particularly to prevent deterioration in bone strength in postmenopausal women (8) . However, there have been inconsistent data about the effects of calcium supplementation on bone health, and several studies have failed to show the efficacy of calcium supplementation in preventing osteoporotic fractures (5, 9) .Vitamin D is another essential component for bone health (10) . In addition to adequate calcium intake, maintaining an optimal vitamin D level is necessary for preventing bone loss (11) . Vitamin D has been reported as an important factor in the relationship between calcium and PTH and may alter the compensatory response of PTH to hypocalcemia (12) . On the other hand, detrimental effects of calcium supplementation have been suggested recently based on data from large epidemiological studies reporting the acceleration of vascular calcification (13, 14) . Thus, there remain uncertainties as to whether increasing the calcium intake is beneficial or harmful for adults.The mean dietary calcium intake is low in Korea (300 -500 mg/d) and in Japan (400 -500 mg/d) (15, 16) . These values are much lower than those reported in Western populations (1100 -1300 mg/d) (12) . The dose interaction between nutrients and related health events may differ according to baseline dietary habits and/or ethnicity (17) . However, most studies that investigated the effects of dietary calcium on skeletal health have been conducted in Western populations, and the evidence is lacking in Asian populations, which have lower intakes of dairy food and dietary calcium compared with Western populations (18 -20) .The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationships between dietary calcium level and BMD or bone geometry in Korea, an area with low dietary calcium intake, using the data from a large nationwide survey.

This study evaluates characteristics and toxicity of PM2.5 collected from rural, urban, industrial, and traffic regions in and around Coimbatore City, Tamilnadu, India. Traffic PM2.5 particles contained higher amounts of metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).

METHODS Questionnaires were completed by 98 children with T1DM (mean age 10.6 yr) and their parent(s); hospital admission data for the previous year were collected. Awareness of hypoglycemia was assessed using two questionnaire-based methods that have been validated in adults. For 4 wk, participants performed routine blood glucose measurements and completed questionnaires after each episode of hypoglycemia. Principal components analysis determined how symptoms correlate; multinomial logistic regression models identified which symptom aggregate best predicted awareness status.   RESULTS The 'Gold' questionnaire classified a greater proportion of the participants as having IAH than the 'Clarke' questionnaire (68.4 vs. 22.4%). Using the 'Clarke' method, but not the 'Gold' method, children with IAH were younger and more likely to require external assistance or hospital admission.

In contrast to adults, behavioral symptoms were the best predictors of awareness status.

Recent findings The 2017 revisions agreed on by an international expert panel, as the precursors, define criteria needed to fulfill dissemination in time and space in the clinically isolated syndrome after exclusion of alternative diagnoses. One major change is the inclusion of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) oligoclonal bands as evidence of dissemination in time in a patient with dissemination in space gathered by clinical or magnetic resonance examination. The distinction between asymptomatic and symptomatic lesions in counting for evidence of dissemination in space or time in supra, infratentorial, and spinal cord syndrome has been abandoned. Finally, cortical lesions can be used to demonstrate dissemination in space. Major differential diagnoses, in particular, the still-evolving concept of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders and the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-IgG-related demyelinating central nervous system disorders.

Dissemination in space (DIS) can be detected at the first clinical manifestation of a demyelinating event (e.g., optic neuritis) by demonstrating at least two lesions on T2-weighted MRI in at least two MS-typical sites (Table 1) . Periventricular, (juxta)cortical, infratentorial, and spinal lesions are considered typical. Because differentiation between juxtacortical and cortical lesions (especially type 1 Table 1 . Major changes Dissemination in space -MRI: cortical and juxtacortical lesions are equivalent to fulfill magnetic resonance criteria of dissemination in space Dissemination in space and time -MRI: the distinction between asymptomatic and symptomatic MRI lesions has been abolished Dissemination in time -CSF: oligoclonal bands, restricted to the CSF, can serve as a substitute for temporal dissemination on MRI, at CIS stage Criteria for diagnosing primary progressive MS: no change except removal of the distinction between symptomatic and asymptomatic MRI lesions; cortical lesions can be used (see above) Definition of disease course/subtype: should be defined at the time of diagnosis.

To be reevaluated periodically Differential diagnosis -NMOSD: NMOSD is clearly differentiated from MS on the basis of the new NMOSD diagnostic criteria cortical lesions, which affect both the cortical grey matter as well as the adjacent juxtacortical white matter [30] ) can be difficult on MRI, the 2017 McDonald criteria no longer differentiate between these two localizations. The distinction between symptomatic and asymptomatic lesions required in 2010 to avoid double counting has been abolished. The inclusion of symptomatic lesions has been shown to increase sensitivity with little or no loss of specificity. This will simplify daily use of these criteria [31] .With regard to temporal distribution [dissemination in time (DIT)], it is sufficient if, at a given time, at least one typically located MS lesion with gadolinium enhancement can be detected, in addition to other nonenhancing T2 lesions ( Table 2 ). If there is no evidence of blood-brain-barrier impairment, there are two alternative means of determining temporal dissemination: either by demonstration of a new typical T2-weighted lesion(s) on follow-up MRI examination (at any point after the initial MRI) or by the presence of intrathecally synthesized oligoclonal bands (or, with less sensitivity, increased IgG index on CSF analysis) [32] .Interpretation of MRI findings needs to take into account other nonspecific (i.e., noninflammatory) causes of white-matter lesions.

{"s2orc_id": 848899, "title": "miRNAs affect the development of hepatocellular carcinoma via dysregulation of their biogenesis and expression", "abstract": "The pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not fully understood, which has affected the early diagnosis and treatment of HCC and the survival time of patients. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of evolutionarily conserved small, non-coding RNAs, which regulate the expression of various genes post-transcriptionally. Emerging evidence indicates that the key enzymes involved in the miRNA biosynthesis pathway and some tumor-specific miRNAs are widely deregulated or upregulated in HCC and closely associated with the occurrence and development of various cancers, including HCC. Early studies have shown that miRNAs have critical roles in HCC progression by targeting many critical protein-coding genes, thereby contributing to the promotion of cell proliferation; the avoidance of apoptosis, inducing via angiogenesis; and the activation of invasion and metastasis pathways. Experimental data indicate that discovery of increasing numbers of aberrantly expressed miRNAs has opened up a new field for investigating the molecular mechanism of HCC progression. In this review, we describe the current knowledge about the roles and validated targets of miRNAs in the above pathways that are known to be hallmarks of HCC, and we also describe the influence of genetic variations in miRNA biosynthesis and genes.", "citation_paragraph": "The synthesis of miRNA mainly consists of two steps, including nuclear synthesis within and outside the nucleus. First, RNA polymerase II acts on the miRNA coding region in the nucleus, and the coding region is transcribed to primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) that contains hundreds of thousands of nucleotides. Subsequently, pri-miRNAs are processed to an miRNA precursor (pre-miRNA) in the nucleus by the microprocessor complex, which consists of the nuclease Drosha and DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 8 (DGCR8). Pre-miRNAs are approximately 60 to 70 nucleotides in length with a stem-loop structure [7] . Then, pre-miRNAs are transported to the outside of the nucleus with the help of the RAS-related nuclear protein with bound GTP (RAN-GTP)-dependent transporter exportin-5 (XPO-5). Pre-miRNAs are released from the Drosha-DGCR8 microprocessor complex in the nucleus, which has a high concentration of RAN-GTP, and are transferred to the cytoplasm along with XPO-5. PremiRNAs are released in the cytoplasm, where the concentration of RAN-GTP is low. In the cytoplasm, premiRNAs undergo additional cleavage by the RNase III endoribonuclease Dicer. The result of this process is the formation of an incomplete matching duplex approximately 21 to 24 nucleotides in length composed of the mature miRNA, which is consequently connected to the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and miRNA*, which is degraded after separation from the complex [8] . Finally, with the help of helicases such as Gemin3 or RCK/p54, mature single-stranded miRNAs are generated. The TAR RNA binding protein or TARBP2 (TRBP), Argonaute 2 (Ago2) and Dicer are involved in the formation of the RISC loading complex (RLC), which can facilitate the binding of the mature miRNA to RISC, where it mediates gene silencing either by translational inhibition or by promoting the degradation of target mRNAs [9] . RISC recognizes the target mRNA by imperfect pairing with mRNA 3' untranslated regions (3'UTR) and perfect pairing with the target mRNA. This recognition results in mRNA degradation and thus the degradation or translation inhibition of the target genes [10] . Gemin4 is one of important components that contributes to both miRNA processing and target gene silencing [11] .Role of the aberrant expression of key enzymes involved in the miRNA biosynthesis pathway in the occurrence and development of hepatocellular carcinoma As the key upstream regulatory factors of miRNAs, the key enzymes involved in the miRNA biosynthesis pathway include Drosha, DGCR8, XPO-5, RAN, Dicer, TRBP, AGO1, AGO2, Gemin4 and Gemin3. The aberrant expression of these enzymes can change a series of downstream miRNAs and factors, which promote or inhibit tumors to interact with each other. Next, the role of some key enzymes in the miRNA biosynthesis pathway and their abnormal expression will be introduced in the occurrence and development of hepatocellular carcinoma ( Figure 1 ).Aberrant key enzymes involved in the regulation of the processing step from pri-miRNA to pre-miRNA Research indicates that Drosha and DGCR8 are the key enzymes involved in the regulation of the processing step from pri-miRNA to pre-miRNA in many types of tumor cells. However, the pri-miRNA to pre-miRNA processing of some miRNAs is relatively independent of the complex of purified DGCR8 and Drosha [12] . Drosha and DGCR8 are frequently over-expressed in HCC. Angela M. Liu and colleagues recently showed that of the genes involved in the biosynthesis of miRNAs, DROSHA is the most differentially expressed in HBV-associated HCC [13] . Moreover, aberrant expression of Drosha can be observed in ovarian cancer, cervical cancer and breast cancer, suggesting that Drosha is involved in many tumors [14] . In addition, the activity of Drosha can be inhibited by HBV. Min Ren and colleagues found that HBV could inhibit the promoter activity of Drosha via HBx and thereby could downregulate Drosha expression; the transcription factors SP1 and AP2a might assist in this downregulation [15] .Aberrant key enzymes involved in controlling the nuclear export of pre-miRNAThe nuclear export of pre-miRNAs mostly relies on XPO-5, whose damage in tumor cells may result in global downregulation of mature miRNAs. Pre-miRNAs are retained in the nucleus in various types of human cancer; thus, a gene defect in the nuclear transporter of premiRNAs may be associated with the occurrence of human tumors [16] . XPO5-inactivating mutations are always observed in many human tumors, indicating that XPO5 is a candidate haplo-insufficient tumor-suppressor gene [17] . During cell cycle entry, the general elevation of miRNAs is important for controlling gene expression. Yuka W and colleagues showed that XPO5 is induced by a PI3K-dependent post-transcriptional mechanism and that the suppression of XPO5 can interfere with the general elevation of miRNA, leading to dysfunctional cell proliferation related to the G1/S transition. However, XPO5 is involved in the export of not only pre-miRNAs but also other non-miRNA molecules [18] . Although research has demonstrated the elevation of primary miRNAs that are likely to target key cyclin, there is still possibility of non-miRNA XPO5 targets of cell cycle control. Verification of the latter possibility requires further study [17] .Aberrant key enzymes involved in the regulation of the processing step from pre-miRNA to mature miRNA Dicer is responsible for the dicing and maturation of miRNA. Most miRNAs are Dicer dependent. However, some scholars have reported that the dicing and maturation of miR-451 are dependent on Ago2, not Dicer [19, 20] . Dicer is coded by the human Dicerl gene, and the latter acts as a haplo-insufficiency tumor suppressor gene [21] . In addition, some studies have demonstrated that Dicerl is the susceptibility gene of familial pleuropulmonary blastoma by family-based linkage analysis and gene mutation detection [22] , and in a mouse model, the monoallelic Dicerl-knockout may lead to retinoblastoma [21] . All these findings indicate that Dicerl mutation can increase tumor susceptibility. Figure 1 Schematic representation of the biogenesis pathway of microRNAs and the aberrant expression of key enzymes involved in this pathway in HCC. First, miRNAs are transcribed by RNA pol II/III from the miRNA coding gene to pri-miRNAs, and soon afterwards microprocessor complex recognizes pri-miRNA to generate pre-miRNA. XPO-5 with its cofactor RAN-GTP mediates the nuclear export of pre-miRNA. Finally, the RLC loading complex assists in the binding of mature miRNA to RISC to mediate gene silencing. However, in HCC, the expression of some key enzymes involved in this pathway appears to be aberrant, and this aberrant expression results in an abnormal microRNA biogenesis pathway (shown in A/B/C/D/E).Dicer is downregulated in most carcinomas, including HCC. The Dicer level is significantly lower in HCC than in adjacent non-neoplastic tissues [23] . Sekine et al. found increased expression of growth promotion genes and the embryonic stage of specific genes in the liver cells of Dicerl-knockout mice. The Dicer1 knockout led to both increased hepatocyte proliferation and apoptosis and a change in blood vessel formation and remodeling [24, 25] . More than 60% of the Dicer1-deficient mice developed HCC derived from residual Dicer1-deficient hepatocytes at 1 year of age. These findings demonstrate that Dicer may play a key role during the process of hepatocarcinogenesis. Han et al. used the shRNA of adenoviral vector to silence the expression of Dicer in tumor cells. They found that the ability of tumor cells to proliferate and invade greatly improved, which was related to the activation of the p-AKT gene and the increased expression of cyclin A, PCNA and the invasive proteins MMP-2 and MMP-9. These results showed that the downregulation of Dicer in tumor cells can promote tumor development via an indirect mechanism. However, the upregulation of Dicer expression still occurs in a handful of tumors. For example, the expression level of Dicer mRNA in patients with stage 3 colorectal cancer is higher than those at stage 2 [26] ; in bronchoalveolar carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma, Dicer mRNA is upregulated [27] . Therefore, a low expression level of Dicer may promote the progress of most tumors that are characterized by higher malignancy and poorer prognosis. However, the opposite conclusions have been reported in the study of colorectal cancer, bronchoalveolar carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma, which suggests that the carcinogenic mechanism of Dicer is tumor specific. The reason of this radical difference is unknown.Another key enzyme involved in the regulation of the processing step from pre-miRNA to mature miRNA is Ago2. Over-expression of Ago2 markedly reduces HCC growth. The function of Ago2 can be adjusted by miRNAs. For example, the tumor suppressor miRNA let-7 could target Lin-41, whose function is to regulate the ubiquitylation and degradation of Ago2; this change thus leads to a high tumor grade and a high tumor stage. Lin-41 can be a predictor of early intrahepatic recurrence. Over-expression of Lin-41 can suppress the expression of the Ago1 and Ago2 of RISC and this suppression can promote the growth of tumor cells. These findings indicate that Lin-41 leads to cancer by suppressing RISC [28] . In addition, miR-99a directly regulates Ago2 through translational repression in HCC. Downregulation of miR-199a and upregulation of Ago2 are also inversely associated in HCC [29] . These studies provide potential strategies for HCC therapy by regulating Ago2 to activate RISC or reintroduction of miRNA suppressors.", "citance": "However, XPO5 is involved in the export of not only pre-miRNAs but also other non-miRNA molecules [18] .", "claims": [{"text": "XPO5 is involved in non-miRNA molecule export.", "subject": "XPO5 ", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 8284212, "title": "DNA Barcoding Reveals Habitual Clonal Dominance of Myeloma Plasma Cells in the Bone Marrow Microenvironment", "abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological malignancy resulting from the uncontrolled proliferation of antibody-producing plasma cells in the bone marrow. At diagnosis, independent plasma cell tumors are found throughout the skeleton. The recirculation of mutant plasma cells from the initial lesion and their recolonization of distant marrow sites are thought to occur by a process similar to solid tumor metastasis. However, the efficiency of this bone marrow homing process and the proportion of disseminated cells that actively divide and contribute to new tumor growth in MM are both unknown. We used the C57BL/KaLwRij mouse model of myeloma, lentiviral-mediated DNA barcoding of 5TGM1 myeloma cells, and next-generation sequencing to investigate the relative efficiency of plasma cell migration to, and growth within, the bone marrow. This approach revealed three major findings: firstly, establishment of metastasis within the bone marrow was extremely inefficient, with approximately 0.01% of circulating myeloma cells becoming resident long term in the bone marrow of each long bone; secondly, the individual cells of each metastasis exhibited marked differences in their proliferative fates, with the majority of final tumor burden within a bone being attributable to the progeny of between 1 and 8 cells; and, thirdly, the proliferative fate of individual clonal plasma cells differed at each bone marrow site in which the cells \"landed.\" These findings suggest that individual myeloma plasma cells are subjected to vastly different selection pressures within the bone marrow microenvironment, highlighting the importance of niche-driven factors, which determine the disease course and outcome.", "citation_paragraph": "MM is characterized by the presence of multiple clonal PC tumors which are disseminated throughout the skeleton [1] . Myeloma can be viewed as the archetype of a cancer that has arisen as a result of metastases of circulating PCs to multiple distal sites from the initial site of growth [11] . As such, an understanding of the mechanisms and characteristics of the myeloma PC trafficking and metastasis is crucial to understanding disease initiation, progression, and relapse following therapy.Using DNA barcoding of 5TGM1 PCs, prior to administration to C57BL/KaLwRij mice, we have been able to use cell-lineage tracking to examine the fates and net tumor contribution of individual MM PCs in vivo. This approach revealed that only a small proportion (approximately 0.01%) of the myeloma PCs injected migrate to, and are retained within, the bone marrow of each long bone. A more striking finding was that the progeny of only a small number of PCs (always fewer than nine cells and often less than three cells) contributed to the majority of the tumor burden in each long bone at day 28. To this end, we estimated that for each proliferative myeloma cell that makes a substantial contribution to tumor burden, 16 times as many PCs remain dormant. This skewing of the growth of individual cells was not seen in in vitro cultures of the same duration, suggesting that there are strong selection pressures in vivo. Similar examples of clonal growth heterogeneity have previously been observed using DNA barcoding in xenogeneic transplants. The HCT-116 colorectal cancer cell line was barcoded using uninduced shRNAs as neutral DNA tags and then grown subcutaneously in immunodeficient mice [37] . After 12 days of growth, deep sequencing of the xenograft revealed that only 6% of the injected cells contributed to 95% of the total aggregate cell number, while 75% of the injected cells had undergone less than 2 cell divisions. By contrast, DNA barcode complexity was maintained in vitro, with 95% of descendant barcoded cells being derived from 80% of the initially tagged clones. Clonal growth heterogeneity in vivo has also been demonstrated using other cell lines [37] . By contrast, xenografts of a barcoded HCC827 small cell lung cancer cell line exhibit less population skewing in vivo when compared with growth in vitro [38] . The more pronounced skewing of the growth trajectories of individual PCs in our model may be the result of using an orthotopic and syngeneic model, whereby a relatively small number of cells (rather than a large bolus of cells) end up being dispersed throughout their native bone marrow environment where they can be subjected to differential gradients of growth-supportive/-suppressive factors. This is consistent with a limited number of very strong and very localized microenvironmental selection pressures within the bone marrow. Very recent findings using xenografts of barcoded primary B-ALL leukemic cells also showed clonal dominance in vivo [39] . To this end, patient-derived xenografts in the bone marrow were highly polyclonal with tens to hundreds of barcodes being detectable following injection of 250,000 cells. Comparison of different skeletal sites in the same recipient mouse showed that often N80% of the barcodes per tumor site were contributed by only 3 to 7 barcodes. In contrast, this clear clonal dominance was not seen in the bone marrow of mice xenografted with a barcoded SupB15 leukemic cell line, but there were still significantly fewer clones compared to the same cells cultured in vitro [43] . Interestingly, the authors also noted a degree of \"metastasis\" of their patient xenografts, with the same group of barcodes often seen in more than one skeletal site and the relative frequencies of each of these barcodes at each site being moderately different [39] . Our studies showed even more marked spatial asymmetry -where often the predominant clones/barcodes in one bone are barely detectable above background levels in other bones.The findings presented here are consistent with our previous studies examining longitudinal tracking of 5TGM1 myeloma cell fate determination using intravital imaging and dye labeling to differentiate dormant from actively dividing myeloma cells [9] . Large numbers of individual myeloma cells were shown to migrate to the endosteal bone surfaces of femurs by day 7 post cell injection. At these sites, the cells were held in a long-term dormant state, in part by soluble factors produced by osteoblasts. By contrast, only a limited number of regions of active myeloma cell growth were observed, peaking with~15 colonies per femur at day 14 post tumor cell administration. At all of the time points examined, the numbers of isolated, individual myeloma cells seen in the bone marrow were always significantly more than the number of myeloma cell colonies. At day 7, the number of individual cells observed at this point was approximately 50 compared with 2 to 3 colonies of active cell growth. These findings bear striking similarity to our DNA-barcoding estimates from day 28, where there were 16 relatively quiescent MM cells for each highly proliferative MM cell. Our ability to track the fate of individual MM cells with heritable tags also suggests that the areas of focal cell growth described in Lawson et al. [9] are likely to be clonal in origin and that at least some of the individual MM cells observed at sites distant to these colonies are likely to be independently migrated cells rather than cells that have been \"shed\" by the growing colonies. Both these studies highlight the fact that unrestricted cell growth and tumor formation are not the inevitable outcome for a myeloma PC that has successfully migrated to and become resident in the bone marrow. The bone marrow is a complex microenvironment with distinct niches, each of which has a different cellular composition and function, such as the well-characterized endosteal/osteoblastic and vascular niches that support HSC (haematopoietic stem cell) maintenance and dissemination [40] [41] [42] . Myeloma PCs have well-characterized interactions with cellular elements of the bone marrow, including osteoclasts, osteoblasts, stromal cells, macrophages, and endothelial cells [11, 43] , many of which produce stimulatory and antiapoptotic factors. It is likely to be the balance between prostimulatory (e.g., stromal cell-produced IL-6 [44] ) and growth-inhibiting (e.g. osteoblast-produced decorin [45] , or host-derived matrix metalloproteinase-7 [46] ) factors that will determine the growth rate of a mutated PC.MM is almost invariably preceded by the premalignant condition of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) characterized by a lower mutant PC burden and lack of any end organ damage [4] . MM can also be preceded by an intermediate asymptomatic state known as smoldering MM (SMM) [47] . It has been traditionally viewed that the transition from asymptomatic MGUS/SMM to MM is associated with an increased mutational burden in the clonal PC, resulting in increased activation of tumorigenic pathways [5] . Indeed, the average number of NS-SNV mutations in MGUS PCs does seem to be lower than that seen in MM PCs [48, 49] . However, examination of matched samples taken from patients before and after malignant transformation has shown that MGUS/SMM PCs can be genetically complex [6] and that transition is often associated with the accumulation of very few new mutations [49, 50] . Furthermore, recent xenograft studies have shown that MGUS PCs have similar tumorigenic potential to MM PCs [51] . These findings suggest that extrinsic factors play an important role in malignant transformation, with disease progression being triggered by cues from the microenvironment [43] . For instance, MGUS patients with increased bone resorption have been seen to be more likely to develop overt myeloma [52] , and induction of bone resorption can increase tumor growth in a mouse model of myeloma [53] .Using DNA barcoding to track myeloma PC fate has proved to have its own technical challenges. The problem of closely related barcodes \"piggy backing\" as sequence errors when particular barcodes become very abundant has previously been raised as a potential concern with this technology [54] . We would recommend that barcodes with up to two mismatches or in\\dels from these abundant barcodes be excluded from further analysis. Despite the inclusion of technical replicates, intersample contaminants that required exclusion were also evident. The modest frequency of double viral-integration events (i.e., 29% of 5TGM1 cells tagged with two barcodes) evident from the sequence analysis of single sorted cells (data not shown) also means that we cannot definitively discount the possibility that, in some individual long bones, we may have overestimated the number of \"seed cells\" whose progeny went on to contribute to the tumors at day 28. With these recommendations in mind, DNA barcoding would be a useful tool for tracking cell fate in cancers that metastasize to bone, particularly breast and prostate cancer [55, 56] . It would also prove interesting to examine whether stimulation of bone remodeling (e.g., following sRANKL exposure) would alter the proportions of frequent and rare barcodes in our model system, as osteoclast activation has previously been associated with a release of MM cells from dormancy [9] .", "citance": "Furthermore, recent xenograft studies have shown that MGUS PCs have similar tumorigenic potential to MM PCs [51] .", "claims": [{"text": "Xenograft studies show that monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) plasma cells have similar tumorigenic potential to multiple myeloma plasma cells.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 29154639, "title": "De Novo Generation of Somatic Stem Cells by YAP/TAZ", "abstract": "Here we present protocols to isolate primary differentiated cells and turn them into stem/progenitor cells (SCs) of the same lineage by transient expression of the transcription factor YAP. With this method, luminal differentiated (LD) cells of the mouse mammary gland are converted into cells that exhibit molecular and functional properties of mammary SCs. YAP also turns fully differentiated pancreatic exocrine cells into pancreatic duct-like progenitors. Similarly, to endogenous, natural SCs, YAP-induced stem-like cells (\"ySCs\") can be eventually expanded as organoid cultures long term in vitro, without further need of ectopic YAP/TAZ, as ySCs are endowed with a heritable self-renewing SC-like state. The reprogramming procedure presented here offers the possibility to generate and expand in vitro progenitor cells of various tissue sources starting from differentiated cells. The straightforward expansion of somatic cells ex vivo has implications for regenerative medicine, for understanding mechanisms of tumor initiation and, more in general, for cell and developmental biology studies.", "citation_paragraph": "An overview of the experimental strategy to reprogram primary pancreatic acini by transient expression of YAP is presented in Figure 2A . Entire acinar clusters are isolated from the bulk of the pancreatic tissue by a combination of mild dissociation and size exclusion through filtration. A typical preparation is presented in Figure 2B . After isolation, the acinar cell clusters should appear as a suspension of exocrine acinar units of homogeneous size, with no contamination by endocrine Langerhans islets or fragments of the pancreatic ductal tree and minimal dissociation to single cells. Contamination by endocrine islets or ductal fragments is an indication of deficient selective filtration (step 2.1.10), possibly due to harsh handling; unwanted dissociation of acinar clusters to single cells might be due to excessive collagenase treatment or unbuffered activity of proteolytic enzymes released by the tissue, which can be curbed by additional SBTI treatment.A typical acinar reprogramming experiment is presented in Figure 2C ; within 5-7 days of culture in 3D Collagen-I based hydrogel in the presence of doxycycline, pancreatic acini derived from R26-rtTAM2/tetO-YAP S127A mice readily turn into duct-like clusters (that we named yDucts), composed by a thin monolayer of epithelial cells that proliferate around an expanding central cavity. The reprogramming efficiency, which is around 70% for a typical experiment, can be easily measured by scoring the number of duct-like clusters over the total number of seeded acini ( Figure 2D) . The negative control cells, that is R26-rtTAM2/+ cells or R26-rtTAM2/tetO-YAP S127A cells left without doxycycline, invariably remain as post-mitotic acinar clusters in these culture conditions, as previously reported 1, 14, 15 . Reprogrammed yDucts can then be passaged at the single cell level into Matrigel-based organoid culture conditions Figures 1A and  2A) .We demonstrated that the isolation strategies here presented effectively isolate a pure population of differentiated cells, as demonstrated by the fact that we never detected any outgrowth from negative control samples (Figures 1C and 2C) .The lentiviral vectors used in this study for the reprogramming of primary mammary LD cells are doxycycline inducible, offering the possibility of a tight control of the transgene expression; this allows to turn on and off exogenous YAP expression at will. Particular attention should be placed in avoiding the use of an excessive viral titer, as this can be detrimental in terms of reprogramming efficiency. In the case of primary acinar cells, we switched to a fully transgenic approach to obtain a YAP-dependent reprogramming with minimal manipulations. This latter strategy is also particularly appropriate for primary pancreatic acini, as isolated acinar clusters are scarcely amenable to lentiviral infection and very fragile. The transgenic strategy employed offers the same advantage of doxycycline-dependent lentiviral vectors for the tight control of gene expression. Moreover, the transgenic strategy exploited with primary pancreatic acini bears the additional advantage of a much higher reprogramming efficiency compared to the viral-induced reprogramming of mammary LD cells. Beyond the different intrinsic plasticity associated to cells derived from different tissues, the higher rate of pancreatic reprogramming might be derived from the higher efficiency of expression associated to uniform and autonomous YAP expression in all explanted cells. Notably, we have demonstrated that exogenous YAP is no longer required after generation of ySCs (yMaSC colonies and yDucts), without affecting their self-renewal capacity. This is because ySCs reactivate endogenous YAP/TAZ and use them for self-renewal when exogenous YAP is turned off Here we also describe procedures to maintain and expand in culture both yMaSCs and yDucts as organoids embedded in 100% basement membrane matrix hydrogels. These conditions allow for the self-organization of ySCs into three-dimensional organoids that ensure the maintenance of stemness properties long-term in culture, enabling to expand these stem populations at will for downstream analyses and applications. For unknown reasons, we failed to obtain yMaSC organoids by placing infected LD cells directly in organoid culture conditions 7 days after doxycycline treatment in plastic tissue culture plate; in other words, the intermediate growth step in mammary colony conditions is essential. In our hands, even native MaSCs require mammary colony conditions before passaging in organoid culture. Furthermore, the most efficient organoid outgrowth is obtained when we avoid dissociating the primary colonies into single cells, but rather transfer the intact colonies into organoid culture conditions.Organoid culture conditions also bear the advantage of giving the possibility to cryopreserve ySCs, provided that the organoids are recovered from their matrices, avoiding cell dissociation prior to cryopreservation in nitrogen bath.The YAP reprogramming procedure presented can convert distinct differentiated cell types derived from different adult tissues into their corresponding tissue-specific stem cells (we have tested it using mammary, pancreatic and neuronal cells) 1 . At difference from iPSCs or other reprogramming efforts, YAP/induced SCs can maintain the memories of their tissue of origin. Of note, de-differentiation of somatic cells into cells endowed with stem-like properties is the only form of cell fate plasticity and reprogramming observed in vivo, for example after tissue damage and to support wound healing 5, 17, 18, 19, 20 . It is noteworthy that YAP and TAZ are largely dispensable for normal homeostasis but crucial for tissue repair in multiple tissues 11, 21 . Consistently with a physiological function of the reprogramming steps here described, YAP/TAZ have been recently shown to be required in intestinal regeneration in mouse models of ulcerative colitis patients by causing a conversion of adult intestinal cells into a repairing epithelium that displays features of the fetal gut 19 . YAP reprogramming thus expands the current induced cell plasticity strategies by providing a means to generate somatic stem cells, a state that has been so far challenging to capture in vitro. This approach, if extended also to human-derived cells, might have broad relevance from regenerative medicine applications to the study of the somatic stemness state and for expansion of somatic stem cells in vitro.", "citance": "Consistently with a physiological function of the reprogramming steps here described, YAP/TAZ have been recently shown to be required in intestinal regeneration in mouse models of ulcerative colitis patients by causing a conversion of adult intestinal cells into a repairing epithelium that displays features of the fetal gut 19 .", "claims": [{"text": "YAP/TAZ causes a conversion of adult intestinal cells into a repairing epithelium in mouse models of ulcerative colitis.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "YAP/TAZ is required in intestinal regeneration in mouse models of ulcerative colitis.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 27952982, "title": "Routine use of pamidronate in NSCLC patients with bone metastasis: results from a retrospective analysis.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND No data on the tolerability and effects of pamidronate in non-small cell lung cancer patients with bone metastasis are available. We performed a retrospective analysis to evaluate the routine use of pamidronate in these patients.   PATIENTS AND METHODS One hundred and four patients with NSCLC were treated at our Day Hospital between May 2003 and February 2009. Forty-one (39.5%) presented with bone metastasis during the course of the disease. Thirty (73.2%) of these patients received pamidronate at a dose of 90 mg every four weeks.   RESULTS The occurrence of bone metastasis was associated with a poor overall survival, but patients treated with pamidronate had a significantly better median overall survival than untreated patients (15.4 months vs. 2.1 months; p<0.001). Pamidronate was well tolerated and only grade 1 or 2 toxicities were registered.   CONCLUSION The diagnosis of bone metastasis and the consequent routine administration of pamidronate have an impact on survival of NSCLC patients; this drug is a good candidate for routine use in haemato-oncological centres.", "citation_paragraph": "metastasis from NSCLC is frequent, and the most involved sites are bone, liver, adrenal gland and brain.Bone metastases are detectable by conventional radiography, computer tomography, positron-emission tomography (PET) or bone scan and are frequently symptomatic. Twenty percent of NSCLC patients have bone metastasis on presentation (3) and a significant proportion of patients develop metastasis during follow-up. Bone metastasis is associated with skeletal related events (SRE) which include hypercalcemia (4), bone pain, bone fractures with surgery requirement, spinal cord compression and need for radiation therapy (5) . These SRE can impair quality of life and may even be responsible for a shortened survival.The preferential seeding and growth of tumour cells in the bone is purportedly due to both tumour cell factors and stromal components of the bone. Recently, an interaction of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) in bone with the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (RANK) on tumour cells has been reported (6) . Monoclonal antibodies such as denosumab which block RANKL have shown promising effects in patients with bone metastasis (7) .Osteoclasts are the most important bone resorbing cells and are of monocyte macrophage origin (8) . Osteoblastic bone resorption can be inhibited by the use of bisphosphonates, which reduce the adherence of osteoclasts to the bony surface, resulting in reduced bone resorption (9) . Two different classes of bisphosphonates are known: the simple bisphosphonates and the aminobisphosphonates. The aminobisphosphonates such as zoledronic acid, pamidronate and ibandronate are more potent than simple bisphosphonates (e.g. clodronate) and thus represent the treatment of choice in patients with bone metastasis. ASCO guidelines recommend the routine use of pamidronate or zoledronic acid in patients with bone metastasis from breast cancer (10) . The use of zoledronic acid is also recommended in prostate cancer patients with bone metastasis (11) . Zoledronic acid seems to have one of the most potent in vitro and in vivo activities (12) . However, adverse events appear to be more frequent with this drug. In fact, osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported in 20% of patients after 3 years of zoledronic acid treatment compared to 7% of patients treated with pamidronate (13) . Thus, long-term use of pamidronate appears to be safer than that of zoledronic acid.Data regarding the use of bisphosphonates in NSCLC patients with bone metastasis are scarce and consensus regarding their use is lacking. Zoledronic acid has been shown to reduce skeletal-related events and time to the first event in a randomized double-blind trial (14) . However, no survival benefit was shown for these patients (15) .

{"s2orc_id": 11432036, "title": "Cell polarity in morphogenesis and metastasis", "abstract": "Most human cancers arise either from epithelial cells or their progenitors. Epithelial cells possess a distinctive apical\u2013basal polarity and loss of polarity is frequently assumed to be a common feature of cancer progression. In particular, cancer cell dissemination to ectopic sites, and metastatic growth at those sites, is often considered to require a mesenchymal transition in which the transformed epithelial cells lose their apical\u2013basal polarity. However, many cancers retain epithelial characteristics, and until recently there has been little conclusive evidence for an involvement of the cell polarity machinery in tumour growth and metastasis. In this article, we discuss evidence that polarity proteins can be potent invasion suppressors but that loss of epithelial character is not essential either for tumour growth and invasion, or metastatic colonization.", "citation_paragraph": "Neuronal stem cells in Drosophila embryos use a conserved set of polarity genes ( par genes) to drive asymmetric mitoses, and the same set of genes is also required for the apical/basal polarity of epithelial cells throughout the animal kingdom [7, 10] . This group of proteins includes Par1, 3, 4, 5 and 6, plus atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), and the Cdc42 GTPase. However, it remains ambiguous as to whether the par genes are necessary for asymmetric stem cell divisions in mammals, in the few cases where such divisions have been documented. For example, Par3 plays a role in radial glial progenitors [11] but is not required for stem cell maintenance in mammary glands [12] , and aPKC is entirely dispensable for haematopoietic stem cell function [13] . It has also been unclear whether the Par genes play any role in cancer initiation or progression, despite the general assumption that defects in cell polarity occur during epithelial tumorigenesis.Until recently, only Par4, a protein kinase also known as LKB1, had been identified as a bona fide tumour suppressor in mammals [14] and it remains uncertain whether carcinogenesis in patients with mutant LKB1 is caused by loss of its polarity function or is instead a result of perturbations in other downstream signalling processes, including metabolism. Par4/LKB1 is a master kinase that can phosphorylate and activate a group of 13 distinct but related downstream protein kinases that includes AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which controls energy homoeostasis, and Par1, another polarity protein, which functions in microtubule stability and cell fate specification [15] . Which of these multiple signalling pathways-known and unknown-contribute to tumour suppression remains to be understood and is likely to be contextspecific. In the pancreas, loss of LKB1 initiates precancerous lesions independently of AMPK, whereas in the intestine AMPK does appear to be involved [16] . Moreover, the LKB1-AMPK axis can act in tumour promotion rather than tumour suppression, by protecting cancer cells from oxidative stress [17] . In a c-Myc breast cancer model, loss of lkb1 promotes tumorigenesis and disrupts epithelial organization and polarity and basement membrane integrity, suggesting that LKB1 polarity functions are important [18] . Loss of lkb1 was also found to promote tumorigenesis in an ErbB2/neu breast cancer model with changes in metabolic signalling, implying that altered metabolism is important [19] . A closer examination of polarity and metabolism in both models would help to resolve whether the effects of loss of lkb1 are tumour-type dependent or, more likely, that multiple effectors of LKB1 contribute to tumorigenesis.This context-dependent duality of effects is not unique to Par4/LKB1. Two forms of aPKC occur in vertebrates, aPKCz and aPKC l/i, which appear to have opposing effects in cancer. The aPKC l/i isoform has been proposed to function as a tumour promoter in non-small cell lung cancer [20] and pancreatic cancer, and also stimulates epithelial-mesenchymal transitions. By contrast, the closely related isoform aPKCz behaves as a tumour suppressor, through effects on glutamine metabolism [21] . As described below, the Par3 polarity protein also behaves as either an oncogene or tumour suppressor, depending on the tumour type.Recently, three groups addressed the question of whether another Par polarity protein, Par3, functions in tumorigenesis (figure 1). The Collard group used a conditional knock-out mouse and a classical two-stage skin cancer model in which K-Ras mutations are induced by application of a carcinogen, DMBA, and tumour outgrowth is promoted by addition of phorbol esters [22] . Surprisingly-as the Par3 protein is likely necessary for the oriented cell divisions that occur during epidermal differentiation-deletion of the pard3 gene in the epidermis had no obvious phenotype. Loss of Par3 did, however, cause a substantial reduction in the number and size of papillomas, mediated by mislocalization of aPKC away from cell -cell junctions, which resulted in increased apoptosis and reduced cell proliferation (figure 1a) [22] . Increased apoptosis in response to loss of Par3 has also been reported previously for mammary glands [12] .These data would support a role for Par3 as a tumour promoter. However, the few papillomas that formed in the skin of mice deleted for Par3 were highly invasive and rapidly formed keratoacanthomas, an aggressive cancer that only rarely occurs in wild-type mice [22] . Paradoxically, therefore, Par3 functions as a tumour suppressor for keratoacanthomas. The cause for these opposing functions of Par3 is not known but could be owing to differences in stem or progenitor cells of origin for different forms of skin cancer.The downstream signalling events involved in the promotion of keratoacanthomas remain unknown. However, in a mammary tumour model, loss of Par3 strongly promotes invasion and metastasis through an aPKC-dependent activation of Jak/Stat3 signalling, which induces expression of a metalloproteinase, MMP9 (figure 1b), with subsequent destruction of the extracellular matrix and invasion [23] . Silencing of Stat3 blocked lung colonization and expression of a constitutively active Stat3 mutant stimulated invasive behaviour even in the presence of Par3. Strikingly, human breast cancers frequently exhibit loss of Par3 expression, which correlates closely with increased aPKC and Stat3 phosphorylation [23] . This pathway seems to depend on oncogenic activation, because although loss of Par3 is in itself sufficient to cause mislocalization of aPKC, the kinase is not activated except in transformed cells. The molecular link between aPKC activation and Jak/Stat3 activation remains to be discovered.A third study, by Muthuswamy and co-workers [24] , investigated Par3 function in an ErbB2 model of breast rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org Phil Trans R Soc B 368: 20130012 cancer and also found that loss of Par3 potentiated metastasis, but in this case in the absence of increased primary tumour growth. They ascribed the increased invasiveness of the tumours to reduced adhesive activity by E-cadherin, mediated through constitutive activation of the Rac GTPase (figure 1c). Par3 is known to regulate an exchange factor for Rac, called Tiam1, and in most situations-both in mammals and Drosophila-restricts its activity [25, 26] . Loss of Par3 leads to Rac hyperactivation through the inappropriate activation/ mislocalization of Tiam1. This effect is apparently context dependent because in MDCK kidney epithelial cells, loss of Par3 disturbs tight junction formation but has little effect on adherens junctions [27] . Nonetheless, there is evidence from genomic sequencing of various human cancers that Rac activation might be an important driver of transformation [28] , and early studies had shown that active Rac mutants could transform NIH 3T3 fibroblasts in vitro [29] .It remains to be established whether in any of these models, the loss of Par3 alters the ability of skin or mammary stem cells to undergo asymmetric cell divisions or alters self-renewal capacity. However, we know that Par3, in conjunction with leucine-guanine-asparagine (LGN), is required for spindle orientation during division of polarized epithelial cells [30] . Moreover, Par3 has also been reported to control the direction of basal cell mitoses [31, 32] . Basal cells are progenitors for keratinocytes, generated by vertical divisions, perpendicular to the basal layer, whereas horizontal divisions provide self-renewal of the basal population. Nonetheless, deletion of Par3 from keratin-14 positive cells in the skin does not cause any phenotype [22] . Presumably, therefore, this polarity protein is not essential for basal cell functionor a compensatory mechanism rescues normal development in its absence.", "citance": "By contrast, the closely related isoform aPKCz behaves as a tumour suppressor, through effects on glutamine metabolism [21] .", "claims": [{"text": "aPKCz causes tumour enhancement by affecting glutamine metabolism.", "subject": "aPKCz ", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "aPKCz causes tumour suppression by affecting glutamine metabolism.", "subject": "aPKCz ", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 8316253, "title": "Understanding the structure and function of the immunological synapse.", "abstract": "The immunological synapse has been an area of very active scientific interest over the last decade. Surprisingly, much about the synapse remains unknown or is controversial. Here we review some of these current issues in the field: how the synapse is defined, its potential role in T-cell function, and our current understanding about how the synapse is formed.", "citation_paragraph": "Elucidating the signaling function of the synapse, and the cSMAC in particular, has proven to be difficult because there are many competing effects and components at play, which makes it difficult to intuit mechanisms from experimental observations of a few variables. Computational and theoretical models have been applied to complement experimental studies to help unravel the interplay of complex-competing effects in various aspects of T-cell signaling (Altan-Bonnet and Germain 2005; Cemerski et al. 2007; Chakraborty and Das 2010; Das et al. 2009; Goldstein et al. 2002; Lee et al. 2003) . This is advantageous because computational models can keep track of the outcomes of different mechanistic hypotheses for each signaling component and determine whether each hypothesis yields results consistent with experimental observations. Because of the complex nature of the interactions, some hypotheses that seem plausible intuitively may be inconsistent with experimental observations, and these can be ruled out by computational modeling. The computational models can also be used to design experiments that can sensitively discriminate between competing plausible hypotheses, which are consistent with all known experimental facts. Such complementary computational and experimental investigations have aided the quest to understand the formation of and signaling in the immunological synapse.Shortly after the first report of the low levels of active signaling molecules in the cSMAC (Lee et al. 2002 ), a computational model was formulated (Lee et al. 2003) to try and shed light on the mechanistic origin of this observation. The computational model placed the TCR and pMHC molecules on two apposed surfaces, and simulated their binding to each other when they were within a certain distance of each other. A threshold level of signaling was used to initiate forces that led to cSMAC formation. The model also simulated the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the ITAMs as a function of the binding kinetics of the TCR and pMHC, allowing for fully or partially phosphorylated ITAMs. As the model was developed, it incorporated aspects of ubiquitination and receptor down-regulation and degradation (Liu et al. 2000; Naramura et al. 2002) . Because biochemical reactions are stochastic events, the computational models explicitly considered these stochastic fluctuations. Importantly, the formation of the cSMAC could be turned on or off at will in the simulations, thus allowing one to assess the potential role of cSMAC formation on TCR signaling under different conditions.Computational studies indicated that the overall amount of signaling as well as its ability to be detected could be affected by cSMAC formation. The model suggested that for strong agonists, the long half-life of the TCR/pMHC complex would allow for efficient TCR triggering before being transported to the cSMAC, consistent with what was subsequently seen in the TCR microcluster studies (Varma et al. 2006) . The model also showed that the process of concentrating receptors in the center of the contact area (cSMAC) would promote receptor degradation by helping to concentrate both phosphorylated TCRs and ubiquitination agents in the same local area. The model, however, also warned experimentalists that low levels of signaling intermediates in the cSMAC might actually reflect rapid degradation of active signaling components and not low levels of signaling. Supporting this idea, experiments using agents to slow receptor degradation resulted in increased detection of phosphotyrosine in the cSMAC (Cemerski et al. 2008) .The computational studies also suggested other implications for the effects of cSMAC formation on signaling. The calculations predicted that assuming that the cSMAC could form, it could enhance signaling induced by weak ligands. Although weak ligands would result in only partially phosphorylated receptors prior to cSMAC formation, concentrating them in the cSMAC along with other signaling components would promote more complete phosphorylation because the higher concentration of receptors and ligands would enhance receptor occupancy. Only subsequently, would the cSMAC enhance degradation. Using manuipulations that enhance cSMAC formation, it was shown that cSMAC formation could enhance signaling by weak ligands (Cemerski et al. 2007) . Although the efficiency of cSMAC formation is related to antigen quality, suggesting that cSMACs do not form in the presence of weak ligands, evidence suggests that nonTCR stimuli can allow for cSMAC formation in the absence of antigen. For example, the cytokine IL-12 and the expression of stress activated ligands for NKG2D can lower the threshold for cSMAC formation. (Markiewicz et al. 2005; Somersalo et al. 2004) . It therefore remains a possibility that the cSMAC could serve to enhance signaling by weak ligands.In spite of these insights, it should be noted that the computational models have not yet incorporated some of the new details that are emerging from the high-resolution TIRF microscopy studies. For example, the different compartments within the cSMAC have not yet been considered in the computational models. Combining models for microcluster formation, transport and SMAC formation explicitly with models for signaling will provide a pathway for quantitatively testing our understanding of how these events are coordinated. Toward this end, adapting and further advancing models of the coarse-grained structures that form during immunological synapse formation may be useful (Burroughs and Wulfing 2002; Qi et al. 2001; Weikl and Lipowsky 2004) . The ability of such physical models to relate patterns to functional outcomes likely point to important physical processes linking membrane bending fluctuations, chemical kinetics, molecular topology and cytoskeletal transport, processes also likely to operate at the level of microcluster formation. Because the rules for microcluster formation are poorly understood simulations should play an important role in testing hypotheses.", "citance": "Using manuipulations that enhance cSMAC formation, it was shown that cSMAC formation could enhance signaling by weak ligands (Cemerski et al. 2007) .", "claims": [{"text": "cSMAC formation enhances weak ligand signalling.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}, {"text": "cSMAC formation represses weak ligand signalling.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}]}
{"s2orc_id": 3348885, "title": "DNA Damage, Repair, and Cancer Metabolism", "abstract": "Although there has been a renewed interest in the field of cancer metabolism in the last decade, the link between metabolism and DNA damage/DNA repair in cancer has yet to be appreciably explored. In this review, we examine the evidence connecting DNA damage and repair mechanisms with cell metabolism through three principal links. (1) Regulation of methyl- and acetyl-group donors through different metabolic pathways can impact DNA folding and remodeling, an essential part of accurate double strand break repair. (2) Glutamine, aspartate, and other nutrients are essential for de novo nucleotide synthesis, which dictates the availability of the nucleotide pool, and thereby influences DNA repair and replication. (3) Reactive oxygen species, which can increase oxidative DNA damage and hence the load of the DNA-repair machinery, are regulated through different metabolic pathways. Interestingly, while metabolism affects DNA repair, DNA damage can also induce metabolic rewiring. Activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) triggers an increase in nucleotide synthesis and anabolic glucose metabolism, while also reducing glutamine anaplerosis. Furthermore, mutations in genes involved in the DDR and DNA repair also lead to metabolic rewiring. Links between cancer metabolism and DNA damage/DNA repair are increasingly apparent, yielding opportunities to investigate the mechanistic basis behind potential metabolic vulnerabilities of a substantial fraction of tumors.", "citation_paragraph": "The metabolic regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels is the third and final link that we address here between DNA-repair/DNA-damage and cell metabolism. High ROS levels affect many aspects of tumor biology and, here, we focus on their role in inducing DNA damage and genomic instability. Most of the DNA lesions that are formed by ROS-induced damage are single strand breaks (SSBs) that can be repaired through nucleotide or base excision repair (NER/BER) (40) . However, these SSBs can lead to stalling of the replication fork or error in replication, ultimately leading to DSBs (40) . The accumulation of oxidative DNA damage increases the burden on the DNA-repair machinery. Tight regulation of cellular redox stress is essential, since high ROS levels can lead to oxidative stress and oxidative damage of proteins, DNA, and lipids, while a certain level of ROS is essential for activating signaling pathways involved in multiple biological processes (41) (42) (43) . Cells have evolved a number of ways to balance ROS levels (Figure 2) . Glutathione (GSH) is one of the major ROS-scavenging molecules (44) , and it occurs in two versions; the reduced form, sulfhydryl GSH, and the oxidized, glutathione disulfide (GSSG). The enzyme GSH peroxidase catalyzes the reduction of H2O2 to water and lipid hydroperoxides to their corresponding lipid alcohols and in turn oxidizes GSH to GSSG. The reverse reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme glutathione reductase, also known as glutathione-disulfide reductase using the reducing potential of NADPH (45) . Glutathione is synthesized in the cytoplasm from cysteine and glutamate, and cysteine availability is the rate-limiting step of the synthesis reaction (46, 47) . Cysteine can be synthesized from serine through the transsulfuration pathway (47), or it can be transported into the cells as cystine in exchange for glutamate using the cystine-glutamate antiporter xCT (39) . Interestingly, mTORC2 can phosphorylate and inhibit the xCT antiporter, therefore providing a mechanism to regulate intracellular cysteine levels (48) . Furthermore, it has been shown that, in some cancer types, growing cells in DMEM containing cystine leads to xCT dependent glutamine dependency in vitro, providing evidence for context dependent changes in metabolism (5) . The main source of NADPH comes from the PPP and a significant amount also comes from the serine synthesis pathway through the THF pathway. Both harness the energy from the catabolism of metabolic intermediates to generate NADPH (31, 47) . Interestingly, an important regulator of ROS levels is the transcription factor nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) that has been shown to directly regulate the key serine synthesis enzymes (PHGDH, PSAT1, ATF4) (49) . This provides a potential mechanism through which NRF2 can regulate ROS levels by influencing NADPH and GSH levels. Importantly, the DNA-repair protein, BRCA1, regulates NRF2, providing an additional link between DNA repair pathways and ROS levels (50) . Overall, there are still many open questions with regards to how cancer cells can rewire their metabolism based on different nutrient availability, but there is growing evidence to suggest that maintaining cellular redox homeostasis plays a major role on DNA-damage/DNA-repair pathways.", "citance": "Interestingly, mTORC2 can phosphorylate and inhibit the xCT antiporter, therefore providing a mechanism to regulate intracellular cysteine levels (48) .", "claims": [{"text": "mTORC2 encourages xCT antiporter through phosphorylation.", "subject": "mTORC2", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "mTORC2 inhibits xCT antiporter through phosphorylation.

Similar to ubiquitination, urmylation requires a thioester intermediate and forms isopeptide bonds between Urm1 and its substrates. In addition, the urmylation process can be significantly enhanced by oxidative stress. Recent findings have demonstrated that Urm1 also acts as a sulfur carrier in the thiolation of eukaryotic tRNA via a mechanism that requires the formation of a thiocarboxylated Urm1. This role is very similar to that of prokaryotic sulfur carriers such as MoaD and ThiS. Evidence strongly supports the hypothesis that Urm1 is the molecular fossil in the evolutionary link between prokaryotic sulfur carriers and eukaryotic ubiquitin-like proteins. In the present review, we discuss the dual role of Urm1 in protein and tRNA modification.", "citation_paragraph": "The Urm1 pathway plays an essential role in the 2-thiolation modification of certain cytosolic tRNA. The sulfur transfer process in the pathway has already been described in detail. tRNA has four canonical bases-adenosine, guanosine, cytidine, and uridine-and also has more than 70 kinds of known post-transcriptional modifications . These modifications can stabilize tRNA, enhance the accuracy of codon binding, reduce the conformational dynamics (Wang et al., 2007; Agris, 2008) , and slightly regulate tRNA interactions with mRNA and the ribosome (Sen and Ghosh, 1976; Bj\u00f6rk et al., 2007; Johansson et al., 2008) . Among these, the wobble modification of uridine, mcm 5 s 2 U, is required for the proper decoding of NNR codons in eukaryotes (Noma et al., 2009 ). This modification is formed via two steps: the oxygen atom at position 2 of the wobble uridine is substituted by a sulfur atom provided by the Urm1 pathway; and position 5 of the uridine residue is modified with a methoxy-carbonyl-methyl by the six-subunit elongator protein (ELP) complex (Fig. 2B) (Svejstrup, 2007; Pedrioli et al., 2008) .Thiocarboxylated Urm1 not only serves as a sulfur donor in the tRNA thiolation process, but also functions as a protein modifier in response to oxidative stress. So what are the relationships between these two functions? Urm1-mediated tRNA modification may be regulated by urmylation of the effective substrate . Interestingly, an essential part of the ELP complex, the elongator complex protein 1, is among the recently identified urmylation substrates in the presence of H 2 O 2 ( Van der Veen et al., 2011) . This observation suggests a link between tRNA modification and protein urmylation, which needs further evidence.", "citance": "Among these, the wobble modification of uridine, mcm 5 s 2 U, is required for the proper decoding of NNR codons in eukaryotes (Noma et al., 2009 ).", "claims": [{"text": "mcm 5 s 2 U is required for proper decoding of NNR codons in eukaryotes.

In the original paper, expression levels of 85 miRNAs were measured in liver and skeletal muscle of euthermic active (control) and torpid animals using a high-throughput qRT-PCR profiling approach.We applied RBioFS, our in-house R implementation of the RF-FS workflow, to the liver dataset. For univariate statistical filtering, all miRNAs that failed to show significant changes (Student's t-test) were discarded; this reduced the miRNA list size from 85 to 35 targets ( Table 1) . The permutation based VI values were then calculated and ranked upon 50 times RF runs (Fig. 4A) . Based on SD values and ranking, a CART model was established to estimate the threshold for the initial RF feature elimination; this resulted in the selection of 12 miRNAs (Table 1 ). An SFS-like selection step was conducted on these 12 miRNAs. Starting with miR-22-5p, 12 recursive RF runs (50 times per run) were carried out adding one miRNA each time. Consequently, the first group featuring 6 miRNAs was considered the most important target. The decreasing trend of the OOB error is shown in Fig. 4B . For both RF steps, a tree count, i.e.: times of resampling (denoted as ntree in the randomForest package) of 501 was used.

It was revealed that these miRNAs significantly downregulated during torpor are likely involved in coordinating a compensatory hepatic thermoregulatory mechanism to facilitate arousal in hibernating marsupials. Indeed, miR-22-5p has been implicated as a regulator of lipid metabolism [53] and DIANA-miRPath [54] analysis of the 6 miRNAs revealed that miR-22-5p, miR-21a-3p, miR-34a-5p, and miR-876-5p directly target key elements of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways.This hypothesis is further supported by the reduced expression level of miR-142-5p that is known to be inversely related to MAPK activity [55] .

This work was conducted to determine the role of microRNA (miR)-212 in the transformation of foam cells from macrophages. We examined the expression of miR-212 in atherosclerotic lesions in an apoE-deficient (apoE-/-) mouse model. The effects of miR-212 overexpression and knockdown on lipid accumulation and cholesterol homeostasis in THP-1 macrophages after exposure to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL). The mechanism underlying the activity of miR-212 was explored. It was found that miR-212 was downregulated in atherosclerotic lesions and macrophages from apoE-/- mice fed high-fat diet, compared to the equivalents from apoE-/- mice fed standard diet. Overexpression of miR-212 promoted lipid accumulation in oxLDL-treated THP-1 macrophages, whereas miR-212 depletion exerted an opposite effect. Macrophage cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein A-I was significantly reduced by miR-212, which was accompanied by reduced ABCA1 expression. Mechanistically, miR-212 targeted sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) to repress the expression of ABCA1 in THP-1 macrophages. Rescue experiments confirmed that co-expression of SIRT1 attenuated lipid accumulation and restored cholesterol efflux in miR-212-overexpressing THP-1 macrophages. Collectively, miR-212 facilitates macrophage foam cell formation and suppresses ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux through downregulation of SIRT1.

Next, we questioned if miR-212 has the ability to induce cholesterol removal from macrophages. Of note, miR-212 overexpression decreased cholesterol efflux to apoA-I by 56%, compared to control miR-transfected cells (P < 0.05; Fig. 3B ). Consistent with the reduction in cholesterol efflux, a lower ABCA1 level was observed in miR-212-overexpressing THP-1 macrophages (Fig. 3C) .miR-212 downregulates ABCA1 in THP-1 macrophages by targeting SIRT1.Having identified the downregulation of ABCA1 by miR-212, we next checked whether ABCA1 acts as a direct target of miR-212. To address this issue, we performed luciferase reporter assay using ABCA1 3\u2032-UTR reporter constructs. In agreement with a previous study showing that miR-148a can repress ABCA1 expression by targeting the 3\u2032-UTR of ABCA1 (Goedeke et al., 2015) , we found that the luciferase activity of the ABCA1 3\u2032-UTR reporter was significantly suppressed by delivery of miR-148a mimic (Fig. 4A) . However, ectopic expression of miR-212 had no significant impact on the expression of the same ABCA1 3\u2032-UTR reporter (P > 0.05 vs. control miR-transfected cells; Fig. 4A ). These results imply that miR-212 suppresses ABCA1 expression via an indirect mechanism. It has been documented that SIRT1 controls the expression of ABCA1 through induction of LXR activity (Li et al., 2007) . Since SIRT1 serves as a target gene for miR-212 in prostate cancer (Ramalinga et al., 2015) , we asked if miR-212-mediated downregulation of ABCA1 is ascribed to reduction of SIRT1. Unsurprisingly, miR-212 overexpression remarkably decreased the protein expression of SIRT1 in THP-1 macrophages (Fig. 4B) . Most importantly, ectopic expression of SIRT1 prevented the downregulation of ABCA1 by miR-212 (Fig. 4C) . These results suggest that targeting SIRT1 accounts for the inhibition of ABCA1 expression by miR-121 in THP-1 macrophages.SIRT1 restores cholesterol efflux in miR-212-overexpressing THP-1 macrophages.Finally, we examined the effect of SIRT1 overexpression on miR- 212-mediated suppression of cholesterol efflux from THP-1 macrophages. Cholesterol efflux from oxLDL-loaded macrophages was significantly (P < 0.05) restored by overexpression of SIRT1 even in the presence of abundant miR-212 (Fig. 5A) . Consistent with the enhancement of cholesterol efflux, enforced expression of SIRT1 significantly impaired miR-212-induced lipid accumulation in THP-1 macrophages in response to oxLDL treatment (Fig. 5B) . Collectively, SIRT1 attenuates miR-212-mediated macrophage foam cell formation through promotion of cholesterol efflux.", "citance": "In agreement with a previous study showing that miR-148a can repress ABCA1 expression by targeting the 3\u2032-UTR of ABCA1 (Goedeke et al., 2015) , we found that the luciferase activity of the ABCA1 3\u2032-UTR reporter was significantly suppressed by delivery of miR-148a mimic (Fig. 4A) .", "claims": [{"text": "miR-148a can repress ABCA1 expression by targeting the 3'-UTR of ABCA1.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 837993, "title": "Virus-Encoded microRNAs: An Overview and a Look to the Future", "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs that play important roles in the regulation of gene expression. First described as posttranscriptional gene regulators in eukaryotic hosts, virus-encoded miRNAs were later uncovered. It is now apparent that diverse virus families, most with DNA genomes, but at least some with RNA genomes, encode miRNAs. While deciphering the functions of viral miRNAs has lagged behind their discovery, recent functional studies are bringing into focus these roles. Some of the best characterized viral miRNA functions include subtle roles in prolonging the longevity of infected cells, evading the immune response, and regulating the switch to lytic infection. Notably, all of these functions are particularly important during persistent infections. Furthermore, an emerging view of viral miRNAs suggests two distinct groups exist. In the first group, viral miRNAs mimic host miRNAs and take advantage of conserved networks of host miRNA target sites. In the larger second group, viral miRNAs do not share common target sites conserved for host miRNAs, and it remains unclear what fraction of these targeted transcripts are beneficial to the virus. Recent insights from multiple virus families have revealed new ways of interacting with the host miRNA machinery including noncanonical miRNA biogenesis and new mechanisms of posttranscriptional cis gene regulation. Exciting challenges await the field, including determining the most relevant miRNA targets and parlaying our current understanding of viral miRNAs into new therapeutic strategies. To accomplish these goals and to better grasp miRNA function, new in vivo models that recapitulate persistent infections associated with viral pathogens are required.", "citation_paragraph": "The restricted gene expression of latency and some other forms of persistent infection represents a successful immune evasion strategy. In addition to encoding direct modulators of the immune response, latently infected cells evade the immune response by expressing a limited number of proteins, providing for reduced antigenicity. Several different herpesviruses encode miRNAs that have been implicated in maintaining latent infection and altering the balance between latent/lytic infection [85] . HSV1, KSHV, and HCMV all encode miRNAs that have been reported to subtly regulate either viral and/or host genes that could promote latent/ persistent infection (reviewed in-depth [28] , discussed briefly below). A recent study demonstrates that miRNA-mediated promotion of latency is not restricted to herpesviruses as Heliothis zea nudivirus-1 (HzNV-1) , a large DNA genome insect virus, encodes miRNAs that promote a latency-like state by directly inhibiting viral gene expression [86] .Studies of the KSHV latency system provide some of the most well-documented examples of viral miRNAs regulating the latent/ lytic switch (reviewed in-depth in [28] ). It should be noted, however, that the effects of individual KSHV miRNAs in this process are invariably subtle. The KSHV encoded miRNAs miR-K12-9-5p and miR-K12-7-5p have been shown to directly regulate the transcript of the master lytic switch protein (RTA) [87, 88] . Several KSHV-encoded miRNAs also target host transcripts that result in enhanced latency [89] [90] [91] . For example, the KSHV-encoded miRNA, miR-K12-1-5p, directly targets the transcript of host gene IkBa, which modulates the NF-kB pathway and reduces lytic activation [89] . Additionally, miR-K12-3-5p directly targets the transcript of host transcription factor NFIB, which has been shown to be an activator of the RTA promoter [91] . Importantly, a KSHV deletion mutant that removes most of the viral miRNAs or knockdown of KSHV miRNA function results in increased lytic activity [89, 91] . As mentioned above, although not as well studied as KSHV, it is likely that virusencoded miRNAs from some other herpes viruses also regulate entry into or the degree of lytic infection.Large-scale efforts to identify transcripts directly targeted by herpesvirus miRNAs have implied that at least some putative viral lytic replication-inducing targets are not detectable in association with RISC [62, 92, 93] . This may suggest that these putative targets are not biologically relevant. On the other hand, the lack of sensitivity of these target identification methods likely would have missed very low abundance ''leaky'' transcripts. As low abundance lytic-promoting transcripts may be sufficient to initiate feedforward lytic-inducing loops, a role for viral miRNAs in promoting latency cannot be ruled out from these negative target profiling studies. Indeed, host miRNAs generally display an inverse cell type expression profile with their targets, suggesting that a major role of miRNAs is to enforce homeostasis when inappropriate low-level ''leaky'' transcripts are expressed [94, 95] . By analogy, enforcing latency against low-level gene expression noise could very well also apply to virus-encoded miRNAs and the simple developmental state of latency (Figure 2) .What about those viruses without a well-defined latency? Polyomaviruses generally take up life-long persistent infections in their hosts but the mechanisms that allow for this are not well understood. We have shown that several polyoma and polyomalike viral miRNAs regulate or have the capacity to regulate early gene expression during late times of lytic infection [79, [96] [97] [98] [99] . Although regulation during lytic infection could be the main function of these miRNAs, it is also possible that, similar to the herpesviruses and HzNV-1, polyomaviral miRNAs may play a role in tilting the balance between persistent and lytic infection. Similarly, HCMV miRNAs have not been studied in a latent context, but it could be predicted based on known viral targets of HCMV [100] and the limited understanding of MCMV miRNA function in vivo [84] that some HCMV miRNAs will play a role in maintaining or establishing latency/persistence. The DNA insect virus Heliothis virescens ascovirus (HvAV) encodes a miRNA that targets its own viral polymerase [101] . Although HvAV infection results in death in some insect hosts, it has recently been shown that other insect hosts may undergo an attenuated infection and thus serve as possible reservoirs for persistent infection [102] . Therefore, it is possible that the HvAV miRNA could promote persistent infection in some contexts. Testing a role for the polyomaviral, HCMV, and ascoviral miRNAs in promoting persistence will likely require developing sensitive in vivo assays.", "citance": "Indeed, host miRNAs generally display an inverse cell type expression profile with their targets, suggesting that a major role of miRNAs is to enforce homeostasis when inappropriate low-level ''leaky'' transcripts are expressed [94, 95] .", "claims": [{"text": "miRNAs enforce homeostasis by suppressing low-level ''leaky'' transcription.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 2916106, "title": "Crosstalk between apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy.", "abstract": "Apoptosis and necrosis are the two major modes of cell death, the molecular mechanisms of which have been extensively studied. Although initially thought to constitute mutually exclusive cellular states, recent findings reveal cellular contexts that require a balanced interplay between these two modes of cellular demise. Several death initiator and effector molecules, signaling pathways and subcellular sites have been identified as key mediators in both processes, either by constituting common modules or alternatively by functioning as a switch allowing cells to decide which route to take, depending on the specific situation. Importantly, autophagy, which is a predominantly cytoprotective process, has been linked to both types of cell death, serving either a pro-survival or pro-death function. Here we review the recent literature that highlights the intricate interplay between apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy, focusing on the relevance and impact of this crosstalk in normal development and in pathology. This article is part of a Special Section entitled: Cell Death Pathways.", "citation_paragraph": "As already mentioned earlier, p53 is activated by a broad range of stressful conditions in the cell, such as DNA damage, hypoxia, or aberrant oncogene expression to promote cell-cycle checkpoints, DNA repair, cellular senescence, and apoptosis [111] . The role of p53 as regulator of apoptosis in both the extrinsic and the intrinsic pathways has been extensively studied. p53 functions to integrate distress signals and induce apoptosis through either the transcriptional activation of the 'multidomain' BCL-2 family member BAX, the 'BH3-only' members PUMA and BID or the attenuation of BCL-2 expression, which antagonizes BAX (Fig. 3) . Notably, p53-induced apoptosis is often context dependent. For example, Bax deficiency compromises p53-mediated apoptosis in oncogenically transformed fibroblasts, but has no obvious effect on p53-mediated apoptosis in normal thymocytes (reviewed in ref. [112] ). In addition to controlling transcription of proapoptotic members of the BCL-2 family, p53 can also transactivate components of the core apoptotic machinery, such as the gene encoding APAF1, which acts as a co-activator of caspase-9. Moreover, p53 can transcriptionally regulate the expression of the effector caspase-6. Although p53 can also activate the transcription of genes acting in the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, its action in apoptosis proceeds primarily through the intrinsic program. Surprisingly, beyond its transactivation functions, p53 has transrepression abilities as well, that may contribute to apoptosis [112] . While most studies have focused on the apoptotic activity of p53, several recent reports have highlighted the functional link between p53 and autophagy. p53 can stimulate autophagy by inhibiting mTOR via activation of the AMP kinase [113] or through the transactivation of DRAM (damage-regulated autophagy modulator), a gene encoding a lysosomal protein that induces autophagy (Fig. 3) . Induction of autophagy by p53 via DRAM contributes to apoptotic cell death in response to genotoxic stress. Therefore, DRAM appears to be a critical component of the network that controls p53-mediated apoptosis and autophagy [114] . Interestingly, emerging findings unravel additional activities of p53 in the cytoplasm, where it triggers apoptosis and blocks autophagy. Deletion, depletion or pharmacological inhibition of p53 induces autophagy in human, mouse and nematode cells. Enhanced autophagy improves the survival of p53-deficient cancer cells under conditions of hypoxia and nutrient depletion, suggesting that autophagy induced by p53 inhibition serves a cytoprotective function. Notably, cytoplasmic, but not nuclear, p53 can repress the enhanced autophagy of p53-deficient cells, implying a complex role for p53 in regulation of autophagy. Compelling evidence suggests that the AMP kinase (AMPK) is activated, while the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) nutrient sensing kinase is inhibited in p53 \u2212/\u2212 cells. Given the crucial role that AMPK and mTOR play in the regulation of autophagy, it is possible that p53 inhibition controls autophagy through the AMPK/mTOR-dependent pathway [115] . Overall, these findings indicate that p53 modulates autophagy depending on its subcellular localization [55] . Collectively, p53 links autophagy and apoptosis in a complex, context-dependent manner, aiming to restore cellular and organismal homeostasis.", "citance": "Given the crucial role that AMPK and mTOR play in the regulation of autophagy, it is possible that p53 inhibition controls autophagy through the AMPK/mTOR-dependent pathway [115] .", "claims": [{"text": "p53 controls autophagy through the AMPK/mTOR-dependent pathway.

{"s2orc_id": 19579216, "title": "Utility of quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment (qSOFA) to predict outcome in patients with pneumonia", "abstract": "BACKGROUND Despite on-going advances in medical treatment, the burden of disease of pneumonia remains high. We aimed to determine the association of the qSOFA score with in-hospital mortality, length of hospitalisation, and admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) in patients with pneumonia. Further, in a subgroup analysis, the outcomes were compared for qSOFA in comparison to other risk scores, including the CURB-65 and SIRS scores.   METHODS In a retrospective analysis, admission data from the ED of the Bern University Hospital, Switzerland, were screened to identify patients admitted for pneumonia. In addition to clinical characteristics, qSOFA and CURB-65 scores and SIRS criteria were assessed and evaluated with respect to the defined study outcomes.   RESULTS 527 patients (median age 66 IQR 50-76) were included in this study. The overall in-hospital mortality was 13.3% (n = 70); 22.0% (n = 116) were transferred to the ICU. The median length of hospitalisation was 7 days (IQR 4-12). In comparison to qSOFA-negative patients, qSOFA-positive patients had increased odds ratios for in-hospital mortality (OR 2.6, 95%:1.4, 4.7, p<0.001) and ICU admission (3.5, 95% CI: 2.0. 5.8, p<0.001) and an increased length of stay (p<0.001). For ICU admission, the specificity of qSOPA-positivity (\u22652) was 82.1% and sensitivity 43.0%. For in-hospital mortality, the specificity of qSOPA-positivity (\u22642) was 88.9% and sensitivity 24.4%. In the subgroup analysis (n = 366). The area under the receiver operating curve for ICU admission was higher for qSOFA than for the CURB-65 score (p = 0.013). The evaluated scores did not differ significantly in their prognostication of in-hospital mortality (p>0.05).   CONCLUSIONS The qSOFA score is associated with in-hospital mortality, ICU admission and length of hospitalisation in ED patients with pneumonia. Subgroup analysis revealed that qSOFA is superior to CURB-65 in respect to prognostication of ICU admission.", "citation_paragraph": "[%] these studies [28, 30] . The latter can be explained by the restriction to community-acquired pneumonia only, whereas in our study 9.7% of the patients suffered from nosocomial pneumonia, which is associated with a higher mortality rate [31] . A further study set in China even found an AUC of 0.81 for 28-day mortality [17] . Although the high AUC in the latter study is striking, the results are not comparable to Western studies, as the 28-day-mortality for hospitalised patients was extremely high (54%), with ICU admission of 85% [17] .Despite the good predictive ability of qSOFA in general ED patients [7, 16, 27] , the prognostic accuracy of the qSOFA score was much smaller for in-hospital mortality among adults admitted to the ICU with suspected infection [29] . In the ICU setting, the SOFA score shows the best predictive ability [29] . Remarkably however, in ICU patients, the AUC (0.607) of a positive qSOFA in predicting in-hospital mortality [29] was very close to the findings in this study (0.608), whereas the AUC for predicting mortality was significantly higher in less ill patient populations [7, 16] . Taken together, these results may indicate that qSOFA is more useful in predicting mortality in populations with lower mortality rates.As found by other authors, qSOFA has low sensitivity in respect to the outcomes in this study [17, 30, 32] . Nonetheless, the sensitivity is comparable to that of other scores, such as CURB-65 or SIRS.qSOFA score was associated with ICU admission in this study. This is in accordance with other studies on general ED patients admitted with suspected infection [7, 16] , and also with a study that investigated patients presenting with pneumonia [17] .qSOFA score is associated with the length of stay in hospital in this study.

Recent evidence suggests that a minor subpopulation of cells with stem cell properties reside within these tumors. These tumor stem cells are more resistant to radiation and chemotherapies than their counterpart differentiated tumor cells and may underlie the persistence and recurrence of tumors following treatment. The various mechanisms by which tumor stem cells avoid or repair the damaging effects of cancer therapies are discussed.", "citation_paragraph": "The extrinsic apoptotic pathway is activated by the specific binding of pro-apoptotic ligands to their cognate cell surface receptors. These ligands include FasL, which binds Fas, and TRAIL, which binds DR4/DR5 [53, 54] . Following ligand/receptor binding, there is recruitment and clustering of the adaptor protein Fas-associated death domain (FADD) and procaspase 8 into a death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) [55] [56] [57] . Formation of the DISC brings the molecules into close proximity of one another and facilitates the catalytic processing of procaspase 8 into caspase 8 [58] . Caspase 8, in turn, is released into the cytoplasm where it activates the effector caspases 3, 6, and/or 7, eventually leading to apoptotic cell death [59] .Decreased sensitivity to apoptotic stresses has been shown to be a contributing factor to the increased resistance of TSC to ionizing radiation and alkylating chemotherapies. The differentiation of TSC with all-trans-retinoic acid increases apoptotic sensitivity, immature CD133 + U87 MG cells are more resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis than their mature CD133 -counterparts and glioma TSC are poor responders to TRAIL-induced apoptosis [60] [61] [62] . One contributing mechanism to decreased apoptotic sensitivity may be the low or absent caspase-8 levels present in glioma TSC secondary to hypermethylation of the procaspase-8 gene promoter [63, 64] . A strategy to facilitate TRAIL-induced apoptosis has been to enhance DR4/DR5 expression by inhibiting its degradation with bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor [65] .L1CAM, a neural adhesion molecule central to cell growth, survival, migration, and axon formation, is differentially upregulated in the CD133 + fraction of gliomas [66, 67] . In vitro treatment of CD133 + glioma cells with L1CAM-shRNA expressing lentiviruses causes reduced neurosphere formation and size and increased apoptosis while having little impact on CD133 -cells [23] . In vivo studies using L1CAM-shRNA have shown that mice bearing glioma xenografts with decreased L1CAM expression survived nearly twice as long as those bearing tumors with wild type L1CAM expression [23] . These studies demonstrate the potential clinical benefit of targeting L1CAM expression and function.Another regulator of apoptosis is tumor necrosis factor-\uf061-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3). Also known as A20, it inhibits the NF-\uf06bB pathway and tumor necrosis factor signaling and confers tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer cells [68] [69] [70] [71] . A20 is highly expressed in glioma TSC relative to non-stem GBM cells and siRNA knockdown of A20 in an in vivo murine xenograft model slows tumor progression [72, 73] . In addition, in silico clinical analyses of tumor databases have indicated that a two-fold upregulation of A20 significantly correlated with decreased survival in patients with grade II or III, but not IV, astrocytomas [73, 74] . Overcoming the relative apoptosis resistance of glioma TSC serves as a potentially attractive therapeutic strategy.", "citance": "A20 is highly expressed in glioma TSC relative to non-stem GBM cells and siRNA knockdown of A20 in an in vivo murine xenograft model slows tumor progression [72, 73] .", "claims": [{"text": "siRNA knockdown of A20 accelerates tumor progression in an in vivo murine xenograft model.", "subject": "", "is_negation": true}, {"text": "siRNA knockdown of A20 slows tumor progression in an in vivo murine xenograft model.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
{"s2orc_id": 5029458, "title": "The YUCCA-Auxin-WOX11 Module Controls Crown Root Development in Rice", "abstract": "A well-developed root system in rice and other crops can ensure plants to efficiently absorb nutrients and water. Auxin is a key regulator for various aspect of root development, but the detailed molecular mechanisms by which auxin controls crown root development in rice are not understood. We show that overexpression of a YUC gene, which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme in auxin biosynthesis, causes massive proliferation of crown roots. On the other hand, we find that disruption of TAA1, which functions upstream of YUC genes, greatly reduces crown root development. We find that YUC overexpression-induced crown root proliferation requires the presence of the transcription factor WOX11. Moreover, the crown rootless phenotype of taa1 mutants was partially rescued by overexpression of WOX11. Furthermore, we show that WOX11 expression is induced in OsYUC1 overexpression lines, but is repressed in the taa1 mutants. Our results indicate that auxin synthesized by the TAA/YUC pathway is necessary and sufficient for crown root development in rice. Auxin activates WOX11 transcription, which subsequently drives crown root initiation and development, establishing the YUC-Auxin-WOX11 module for crown root development in rice.", "citation_paragraph": "Roots determine the amount of nutrients and water available for plant growth and development, direct impacting yield and other agriculturally important traits. Rice root system consists of seminal roots and postembryonic shoot-borne crown roots with lateral roots branching off from both (Mai et al., 2014) . Because of its agronomic importance, rice root system has been studied extensively using both genetic and genomic approaches. The emerging picture is that auxin plays an essential role in almost every aspect of rice root growth and development. Disruption of auxin biosynthesis, metabolism, transport, or signaling has a profound impact on rice root development.Genetic screens for mutants that display altered patterns and/or morphology of root systems identified multiple loci (Mai et al., 2014) . Molecular cloning and characterization of the rice root mutants clearly demonstrated the essential roles of auxin in root development. For example, gain-of-function mutations in the domain II of OsIAA11 and OsIAA13, which encodes negative regulators of auxin signaling, abolish lateral development (Kitomi et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2012) . Gain-of-function mutations in OsIAA23 lead to a dramatic reduction of crown roots and lateral roots (Jun et al., 2011) . Moreover, OsIAA23 is required for QC maintenance (Jun et al., 2011) . Other auxin signaling components such as OsTIR1/AFB2 (Xia et al., 2012) , OsCAND1 (Wang et al., 2011) , OsCYP2 (Kang et al., 2013) , LATERAL ROOTLESS2 (LRT2) (Jing et al., 2015) are also required for crown root and lateral development. Forward genetic screens have isolated six crown rootless (crl) mutants, which either did not develop any crown roots or had dramatically reduced number of crown roots (Inukai et al., 2001) . CRL1 encodes the OsLBD3-2, which is transcriptionally regulated by the Auxin Response Factor 16, suggesting that CRL1 is also part of the auxin regulated network required for crown root development (Inukai et al., 2001; Coudert et al., 2015) . The crl2 and crl3 mutants are defective in crown root primordia development and cell elongation (Inukai et al., 2001; Kitomi et al., 2008) , but the molecular identities of CRL2 and CRL3 have not been determined. The crl4 phenotypes were caused by a mutation in the GNOM1 gene, which encodes a ADP-ribosylation factor, and which is implicated in trafficking of the auxin efflux carrier PIN-FORMED (PIN) proteins, suggesting that polar auxin transport is also required for rice root development ). Overexpression of OsPID, which was proposed as a regulator of PIN polarity, also affects root development (Morita and Kyozuka, 2007) . Other auxin transport-related genes including OsPIN1 (Xu et al., 2005) , OsPIN2 (Chen et al., 2012) , and OsAUX1 (Zhao H. et al., 2015) have been implicated in crown root development as well. CRL5 encodes a member of the large AP2/ERF transcription factor family (Kitomi et al., 2011) . The crl5 mutant produced fewer crown roots and displayed impaired initiation of crown root primordia (Kitomi et al., 2011) . CRL5 is also part of the auxin regulated network because exogenous auxin treatment induced CRL5 expression without de novo protein biosynthesis. Auxin-induced CRL5 expression requires the degradation of AUX/IAA proteins. OsARF1 binds to the CRL5 promoter, and CRL5 controls the cytokinin signaling pathway via type-A response regulators (ARRs) (Kitomi et al., 2011) . CRL6 encodes a member of the large chromodomain, helicase/ATPase, and DNA-binding domain (CHD) family protein (Wang et al., 2016) . CRL6 influences crown root formation by regulating primordial initiation and development. It was shown that the expressions of OsIAA genes were down-regulated in crl6, linking CRL6 to auxin regulatory network (Wang et al., 2016) .Auxin is mainly synthesized by the TAA/YUC pathway, which is highly conserved throughout the plant kingdom (Zhao, 2012) . TAA aminotransferases convert Trp to Indole-3-pyruvate (IPA), which subsequently undergoes oxidative decarboxylation catalyzed by the YUC flavin monooxygenases to produce IAA Won et al., 2011) . It was shown that auxin synthesized by the TAA/YUC pathway plays critical roles in root development in Arabidopsis (Stepanova et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2014) . Disruption of various combinations of YUC genes and/or TAA genes can cause moderate to very severe root defects in Arabidopsis. For example, the taa1 tar1 tar2 triple mutants in Arabidopsis fail to make root meristem during embryogenesis (Stepanova et al., 2008) . Similar phenotypes were observed in yuc1 yuc4 yuc10 yuc11 quadruple mutants (Cheng et al., 2007) . Some other yuc combinations in Arabidopsis such as yuc3 yuc5 yuc7 yuc8 yuc9 quintuple mutants (yucQ) have very short and agravitropic roots (Chen et al., 2014) . In rice, the taa1 mutants, also known as fib1(fish bone 1) display pleotropic phenotypes including agravitropic roots, long seminal roots, few crown roots, and a lack of lateral roots (Yoshikawa et al., 2014) . Other TAA homologs in rice such as OsTAR1 is likely also involved in auxin biosynthesis (Kakei et al., 2017) . Overexpression of OsYUC1 increased IAA levels and led to characteristic auxin overproduction phenotypes including thick hairy roots, ectopic crown roots developed from elongated node, and defective leaf growth (Yamamoto et al., 2007) . Inhibition of OsYUC1 expression by antisense construct leads to severe shoot dwarfism and defective root formation (Yamamoto et al., 2007) . However OsYUC4 RNAi lines did not displayed abnormal phenotype (Yamamoto et al., 2007) . Both the OsCOW1 (CONSTITUTIVELY WILTED 1) and OsNAL7 (NARROW LEAF 7) are the OsYUC8 gene (Woo et al., 2007; Fujino et al., 2008) . The Osyuc8 mutants greatly reduced the amount of roots (Woo et al., 2007; Fujino et al., 2008) . It has been evident that auxin synthesized by the TAA/YUC pathway plays important roles in rice root development.Besides auxin, the transcription factor WOX11 appears to play a paramountly important role in root development (Zhao et al., 2009) . Crown root development is inhibited in the lossof-function wox11 mutants, whereas overexpression of WOX11 stimulates crown root growth and the development of crown roots from the upper stem nodes (Zhao et al., 2009) . It was shown that WOX11 interacts with ERF3 and binds to the RR2 promoter to directly regulate the crown root development . WOX11 is also involved in lateral root initiation, root hair formation, and abiotic stress-responsive development Cheng et al., 2016) . Furthermore, it has been suggested that WOX11 can recruit ADA2-GCN5 histone acetyltransferase module to activate downstream target genes in crown root development . In Arabidopsis, WOX11 was induced by exogenous IAA application and it controls the first-step of cell fate transition during callus initiation (Liu et al., 2014; Hu and Xu, 2016) . WOX11 also mediated the primary root development by regulating the WOX5/7 expression with or without auxin induction (Sheng et al., 2017) .In this paper, we investigate the relationship between auxin and WOX11, the two important regulators of crown root development in rice. We show that overexpression of the YUC genes leads to massive over proliferation of crown roots. However, in the absence of WOX11, overexpression of YUC genes did not stimulate crown root development. On the other hand, overexpression of WOX11 in the taa1/fib1 mutant background, which fails to produce crown roots, restored the crown root development. Our results demonstrate that auxin synthesized by the TAA/YUC pathway is necessary and sufficient for crown root initiation and development. Moreover, we show that WOX11 functions downstream TAA/YUC pathway and that auxin-induced crown root development is largely controlled by WOX11.", "citance": "For example, the taa1 tar1 tar2 triple mutants in Arabidopsis fail to make root meristem during embryogenesis (Stepanova et al., 2008) .", "claims": [{"text": "taa1 tar1 tar2 triple mutants in Arabidopsis do not make root meristem during embryogenesis.", "subject": "taa1 tar1 tar2 triple mutants", "is_negation": false}]}

During the last decade, preclinical studies have revealed that integrins play an important role in resistance to therapies targeting RTKs and their downstream pathways. A remarkable feature of integrins is their wide-ranging interconnection with RTKs, which helps cancer cells to adapt and better survive therapeutic treatments. In this context, we should consider not only the integrins expressed in cancer cells but also those expressed in stromal cells, since these can mechanically increase the rigidity of the tumor microenvironment and confer resistance to treatment. This review presents some of these mechanisms and outlines new treatment options for improving the efficacy of therapies targeting RTK signaling.", "citation_paragraph": "The work of Seguin and colleagues paved the way for the demonstration of a pivotal role for \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin in resistance to EGFR-targeted therapy [19] . They first established that \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin was selectively expressed by tumor-initiating cells from lung and pancreatic carcinoma patient-derived-xenografts (PDXs). More strikingly, \u03b23 expression drove lung and pancreatic cancer cell resistance to TKIs targeting EGFR (erlotinib and lapatinib) both in vitro and in mice. Conversely, the short hairpin RNA-mediated depletion of \u03b23 sensitized cells to the TKIs. In fact, TKI treatment of human PDX tumors led to the selection of \u03b23-positive cells that acquired stem cell-like and resistant phenotypes. Mechanistically, \u03b23 integrin activates the KRAS (V-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog)/RalB (Ras-like proto-oncogene B)/NF-kB pathway. It is important to note that the activation of this pathway is independent of the canonical FAK pathway and of integrin/ECM interaction. While this is surprising at first glance, the same group had already observed that \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin could promote tumor progression independently of ligand binding and FAK activation [115] . The authors discovered that the recruitment of KRAS and the consequent activation of RaIB by \u03b23 required \u03b23 binding to galectin-3, a cell adhesion protein with a specific affinity for \u03b2-galactoside glycoconjugates (Figure 3 ). \u03b23 integrin may also play a pivotal role in mutant KRAS oncogenic function [116] . In a subset of lung and pancreatic adenocarcinomas addicted to mutant KRAS, the disruption of galectin-3/\u03b23 interaction by GCS-100, a galectin-3 antagonist currently under clinical development [117] , released mutant KRAS from \u03b23 and inhibited tumor growth in mice. While these results may suggest that GCS-100 could sensitize lung cancer cells to TKIs, the authors have not yet explored this possibility. A growing body of data indicates that microRNA (miRNA) dysregulation modulates gefitinib resistance in lung carcinoma [118] [119] [120] [121] [122] [123] [124] In gefitinib-resistant cells, a miRNA targeting the 3 -UTR of \u03b23 integrin (miR-483-3p) is silenced by epigenetic methylation. The forced overexpression of \u03b23 integrin can restore gefitinib resistance in miR-483-3p-expressing cells through the activation of a \u03b23/FAK/ERK pathway and epithelial to mesenchymal transition induction [20] . In vitro and vivo data revealed that \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin may support resistance to therapies targeting several RTKs (EGFR, IGFR, PDGFR, FGFR, VEGFR). Furthermore, mechanisms of resistance to EGFR and IGFR TKIs have been identified and found to be independent of \u03b1v\u03b23 binding to ECM ligands, via recognition of the RGD sequence [19, 21] . Given the clinical failure of cilengitide to improve the outcomes of cetuximab-treated patients [122, 123] , the time may have come for the development and use of integrin-targeted drugs that do not target integrin binding to ECM proteins such as RGDderived peptide.", "citance": "While this is surprising at first glance, the same group had already observed that \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin could promote tumor progression independently of ligand binding and FAK activation [115] .", "claims": [{"text": "\u03b1v\u03b23 integrin promotes tumor progression independently of ligand binding and FAK activation.", "subject": "", "is_negation": false}]}
