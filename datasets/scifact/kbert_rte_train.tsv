0	CONCLUSION Treatment with high doses of folic acid and B vitamins did not improve survival or reduce the incidence of vascular disease in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.	40mg/day dosage of folic acid and 2mg/day dosage of vitamin B12 does not affect chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression.
1	Folic acid and B vitamins decrease homocysteine levels in this population but whether they lower mortality is unknown.	40mg/day dosage of folic acid and 2mg/day dosage of vitamin B12 does not affect chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression.
1	It was lowered 6.3 micromol/L (25.8%; P < .001) in the vitamin group and 0.4 micromol/L (1.7%; P = .14) in the placebo group at 3 months, but there was no significant effect on mortality (448 vitamin group deaths vs 436 placebo group deaths) (hazard ratio [HR], 1.04; 95% CI, 0.91-1.18).	40mg/day dosage of folic acid and 2mg/day dosage of vitamin B12 does not affect chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression.

2	We report that activation of basophils by autoreactive IgE causes their homing to lymph nodes, promoting T helper type 2 (T(H)2) cell differentiation and enhancing the production of self-reactive antibodies that cause lupus-like nephritis in mice lacking the Src family protein tyrosine kinase Lyn (Lyn(-/-) mice).	A T helper 2 cell (Th2) environment impedes disease development in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
2	Individuals with SLE also have elevated serum IgE, self-reactive IgEs and activated basophils that express CD62 ligand (CD62L) and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecule human leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR), parameters that are associated with increased disease activity and active lupus nephritis.	A T helper 2 cell (Th2) environment impedes disease development in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
2	Thus, in Lyn(-/-) mice, basophils and IgE autoantibodies amplify autoantibody production that leads to lupus nephritis, and in individuals with SLE IgE autoantibodies and activated basophils are factors associated with disease activity and nephritis.	A T helper 2 cell (Th2) environment impedes disease development in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

0	Individuals homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia have microcytosis and an increased erythrocyte count.We estimated that the haematological profile in children homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia reduces the risk of SMA during acute malaria compared to children of normal genotype (relative risk 0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.24-1.12, p = 0.09).	A high microerythrocyte count protects against severe anemia in homozygous alpha (+)- thalassemia trait subjects.
0	CONCLUSIONS The increased erythrocyte count and microcytosis in children homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia may contribute substantially to their protection against SMA.	A high microerythrocyte count protects against severe anemia in homozygous alpha (+)- thalassemia trait subjects.
1	We observed a reduction in median erythrocyte count of approximately 1.5 x 10(12)/l in all children with acute falciparum malaria relative to values in community children (p < 0.001).	A high microerythrocyte count protects against severe anemia in homozygous alpha (+)- thalassemia trait subjects.

2	Using human neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells that expressed apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4), a variant of the APOE gene product and the major genetic risk factor for AD, we demonstrated that ApoE4-expressing neurons had higher levels of tau phosphorylation, unrelated to their increased production of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, and that they displayed GABAergic neuron degeneration.

2	RESULTS Alirocumab reduced ultracentrifugally isolated LDL-C by 55.1%, LDL-apoB by 56.3%, and plasma Lp(a) by 18.7%.The fall in LDL-apoB was caused by an 80.4% increase in LDL-apoB FCR and a 23.9% reduction in LDL-apoB PR.	Alirocumab treatment reduces apo(a) fractional clearance rate.
2	The FCR of apo(a) tended to increase (24.6%) without any change in apo(a) PR.	Alirocumab treatment reduces apo(a) fractional clearance rate.
2	CONCLUSIONS Alirocumab decreased LDL-C and LDL-apoB by increasing IDL- and LDL-apoB FCRs and decreasing LDL-apoB PR.	Alirocumab treatment reduces apo(a) fractional clearance rate.
2	The increase in apo(a) FCR during alirocumab treatment suggests that increased LDL receptors may also play a role in the reduction of plasma Lp(a).	Alirocumab treatment reduces apo(a) fractional clearance rate.

1	Although studies in mice and cells have identified increased hepatic LDL receptors as the basis for LDL lowering by PCSK9 inhibitors, there have been no human studies characterizing the effects of PCSK9 inhibitors on lipoprotein metabolism.	Alirocumab treatment reduces apo(a) fractional clearance rate.
1	These results are consistent with increases in LDL receptors available to clear IDL and LDL from blood during PCSK9 inhibition.	Alirocumab treatment reduces apo(a) fractional clearance rate.

2	At 1 year, there were no ventricular arrhythmia SAEs observed among allogeneic recipients compared with 4 patients (26.7%) in the autologous group (P = .10).	Allogeneic mechanical circulatory support is not as effective as autologous mechanical circulatory support for treating acute myocardial infarction.
2	Allogeneic and autologous MSCs reduced mean EED by −33.21% (95% CI, −43.61% to −22.81%; P < .001) and sphericity index but did not increase EF.	Allogeneic mechanical circulatory support is not as effective as autologous mechanical circulatory support for treating acute myocardial infarction.
2	CONCLUSIONS In this early-stage study of patients with ICM, transendocardial injection of allogeneic and autologous MSCs without a placebo control were both associated with low rates of treatment-emergent SAEs, including immunologic reactions.	Allogeneic mechanical circulatory support is not as effective as autologous mechanical circulatory support for treating acute myocardial infarction.
1	Efficacy assessments included 6-minute walk test, exercise peak VO2, Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ), New York Heart Association class, LV volumes, ejection fraction (EF), early enhancement defect (EED; infarct size), and sphericity index.

Alteration of origin firing causes changes in termination zones of Okazaki fragments.
2	Compared with ambulatory monitoring thresholds of 135/85 mm Hg, clinic measurements over 140/90 mm Hg had mean sensitivity and specificity of 74.6% (95% confidence interval 60.7% to 84.8%) and 74.6% (47.9% to 90.4%), respectively, whereas home measurements over 135/85 mm Hg had mean sensitivity and specificity of 85.7% (78.0% to 91.0%) and 62.4% (48.0% to 75.0%).	Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is inaccurate at diagnosing hypertension.
2	If ambulatory monitoring is taken as the reference standard, then treatment decisions based on clinic or home blood pressure alone might result in substantial overdiagnosis.	Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is inaccurate at diagnosing hypertension.
2	Ambulatory monitoring before the start of lifelong drug treatment might lead to more appropriate targeting of treatment, particularly around the diagnostic threshold.	Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is inaccurate at diagnosing hypertension.
1	Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Eligible studies examined diagnosis of hypertension in adults of all ages using home and/or clinic blood pressure measurement compared with those made using ambulatory monitoring that clearly defined thresholds to diagnose hypertension.	Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is inaccurate at diagnosing hypertension.
1	RESULTS The 20 eligible studies used various thresholds for the diagnosis of hypertension, and only seven studies (clinic) and three studies (home) could be directly compared with ambulatory monitoring.	Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is inaccurate at diagnosing hypertension.
1	CONCLUSIONS Neither clinic nor home measurement had sufficient sensitivity or specificity to be recommended as a single diagnostic test.	Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is inaccurate at diagnosing hypertension.
2	BACKGROUND The diagnosis of hypertension has traditionally been based on blood-pressure measurements in the clinic, but home and ambulatory measurements better correlate with cardiovascular outcome, and ambulatory monitoring is more accurate than both clinic and home monitoring in diagnosing hypertension.	Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is inaccurate at diagnosing hypertension.
2	INTERPRETATION Ambulatory monitoring as a diagnostic strategy for hypertension after an initial raised reading in the clinic would reduce misdiagnosis and save costs.	Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is inaccurate at diagnosing hypertension.
1	We used a hypothetical primary-care population aged 40 years or older with a screening blood-pressure measurement greater than 140/90 mm Hg and risk-factor prevalence equivalent to the general population.	Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is inaccurate at diagnosing hypertension.
1	We compared three diagnostic strategies-further blood pressure measurement in the clinic, at home, and with an ambulatory monitor-in terms of lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life years, and cost-effectiveness.	Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is inaccurate at diagnosing hypertension.

2	Although ACE inhibitor therapy usually improves renal blood flow (RBF) and sodium excretion rates in CHF and reduces the rate of progressive renal injury in chronic renal disease, its use can also be associated with a syndrome of “functional renal insufficiency” and/or hyperkalemia.	Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are associated with decreased risk for functional renal insufficiency.
2	Understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms and the common risk factors for ACE inhibitor–induced functional ARF is critical, because preventive strategies for ARF exist, and if effectively used, they may permit use of these compounds in a less restricted fashion.	Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are associated with decreased risk for functional renal insufficiency.
1	This form of acute renal failure (ARF) most commonly develops shortly after initiation of ACE inhibitor therapy but can be observed after months or years of therapy, even in the absence of prior ill effects.	Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are associated with decreased risk for functional renal insufficiency.
1	Conditions that predict an adverse hemodynamic effect of ACE inhibitors in patients with CHF are preexisting hypotension and low cardiac filling pressures.	Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are associated with decreased risk for functional renal insufficiency.

2	Unexpectedly, these mice showed decreased fat mass and were protected from diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance; this phenotype was accompanied by increased fatty acid oxidation and browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) owing to induction of fibroblast growth factor 21 (Fgf21).	Autophagy deficiency in the liver increases vulnerability to insulin resistance.
2	We also observed induction of Fgf21, resistance to diet-induced obesity and amelioration of insulin resistance in mice with autophagy deficiency in the liver, another insulin target tissue.	Autophagy deficiency in the liver increases vulnerability to insulin resistance.
2	These findings suggest that autophagy deficiency and subsequent mitochondrial dysfunction promote Fgf21 expression, a hormone we consequently term a 'mitokine', and together these processes promote protection from diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance.	Autophagy deficiency in the liver increases vulnerability to insulin resistance.
1	We produced mice with skeletal muscle–specific deletion of Atg7 (encoding autophagy-related 7).	Autophagy deficiency in the liver increases vulnerability to insulin resistance.
1	Mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitors also induced Fgf21 in an Atf4-dependent manner.	Autophagy deficiency in the liver increases vulnerability to insulin resistance.
1	Mitochondrial dysfunction induced by autophagy deficiency increased Fgf21 expression through induction of Atf4, a master regulator of the integrated stress response.	Autophagy deficiency in the liver increases vulnerability to insulin resistance.
0	Here, we show that expression of the orphan G protein-coupled receptor Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 2 (EBI2, also known as GPR183) by activated B cells was essential for their movement to extrafollicular sites and induction of early plasmablast responses.	B cells go though plasmablast differentiation and antibody production by continuous expression of EBI2.
0	EBI2 therefore provides a previously uncharacterized dimension to B cell migration that is crucial for coordinating rapid versus long-term antibody responses.	B cells go though plasmablast differentiation and antibody production by continuous expression of EBI2.
1	This is achieved by the generation of spatially distinct extrafollicular plasmablast and follicular germinal center (GC) B cell populations, but the signals that guide responding B cells to these alternative compartments have not been fully elucidated.	B cells go though plasmablast differentiation and antibody production by continuous expression of EBI2.
1	Conversely, downregulation of EBI2 enabled B cells to access the center of follicles and promoted efficient GC formation.	B cells go though plasmablast differentiation and antibody production by continuous expression of EBI2.

0	We report that activation of basophils by autoreactive IgE causes their homing to lymph nodes, promoting T helper type 2 (T(H)2) cell differentiation and enhancing the production of self-reactive antibodies that cause lupus-like nephritis in mice lacking the Src family protein tyrosine kinase Lyn (Lyn(-/-) mice).	Basophils promote disease development in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
0	Individuals with SLE also have elevated serum IgE, self-reactive IgEs and activated basophils that express CD62 ligand (CD62L) and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecule human leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR), parameters that are associated with increased disease activity and active lupus nephritis.	Basophils promote disease development in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
0	Thus, in Lyn(-/-) mice, basophils and IgE autoantibodies amplify autoantibody production that leads to lupus nephritis, and in individuals with SLE IgE autoantibodies and activated basophils are factors associated with disease activity and nephritis.	Basophils promote disease development in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Birth-weight is negatively associated with breast cancer.
2	Relative to women who weighed 3.000-3.499 kg, the risk was 0.96 (CI 0.80-1.16) in those who weighed < 2.500 kg, and 1.12 (95% CI 1.00-1.25) in those who weighed > or = 4.000 kg (p for linear trend = 0.001) in birth record data.	Birth-weight is negatively associated with breast cancer.
2	CONCLUSIONS This pooled analysis of individual participant data is consistent with birth size, and in particular birth length, being an independent correlate of breast cancer risk in adulthood.	Birth-weight is negatively associated with breast cancer.
1	Random effect models were used, if appropriate, to combine study-specific estimates of effect.	Birth-weight is negatively associated with breast cancer.
1	The birth size effects did not appear to be confounded or mediated by established breast cancer risk factors and were not modified by age or menopausal status.	Birth-weight is negatively associated with breast cancer.
1	BACKGROUND Birth size, perhaps a proxy for prenatal environment, might be a correlate of subsequent breast cancer risk, but findings from epidemiological studies have been inconsistent.	Birth-weight is negatively associated with breast cancer.
2	The relative risk estimate for breast cancer comparing women with high birthweight to women with low birthweight combining all studies including both pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer was 1.23 (95% confidence interval 1.13-1.34).	Birth-weight is negatively associated with breast cancer.
1	To date, 26 research papers addressing this issue have been published.	Birth-weight is negatively associated with breast cancer.
2	Increased risk of breast cancer was noted with increased birthweight (relative risk [RR] 1.15 [95% CI 1.09-1.21]), birth length (1.28 [1.11-1.48]), higher maternal age (1.13 [1.02-1.25]), and paternal age (1.12 [1.05-1.19]).	Birth-weight is negatively associated with breast cancer.
1	No association was noted between risk of breast cancer and gestational age at birth (0.95 [0.71-1.26]) or maternal diethylstilbestrol treatment (1.40 [0.86-2.28]).	Birth-weight is negatively associated with breast cancer.
2	RESULTS We found that heavier birth weights were associated with increased breast cancer risk, with studies involving five categories of birth weight identifying odds ratios (ORs) of 1.24 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04 to 1.48) for 4,000 g or more and 1.15 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.26) for 3,500 g to 3,999 g, relative to a birth weight of 2,500 to 2,599 g. These studies provided no support for a J-shaped relationship of birthweight to risk.	Birth-weight is negatively associated with breast cancer.
2	CONCLUSION Our findings provide some support for the hypothesis that in utero exposures reflective of higher endogenous hormone levels could affect risk for development of breast cancer in adulthood.	Birth-weight is negatively associated with breast cancer.
1	METHODS We reviewed breast cancer studies published from January 1966 to February 2007 that included data on birth weight, birth order, maternal age, gestational age, twin status, and maternal or paternal smoking.	Birth-weight is negatively associated with breast cancer.
1	Birth order, prematurity, and maternal smoking were unrelated to breast cancer risk.	Birth-weight is negatively associated with breast cancer.

2	Cytokines hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), osteopontin (OPN), and stromal-derived factor 1α (SDF-1), secreted from tumor associated cells, increase CD44v6 expression in CR-CSCs by activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which promotes migration and metastasis.	CD44v6 is not associated with constitutive and reprogrammed cancer stem cells driving cancer metastasis.
2	CD44v6(-) progenitor cells do not give rise to metastatic lesions but, when treated with cytokines, acquire CD44v6 expression and metastatic capacity.	CD44v6 is not associated with constitutive and reprogrammed cancer stem cells driving cancer metastasis.
2	Importantly, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibition selectively killed CD44v6 CR-CSCs and reduced metastatic growth.	CD44v6 is not associated with constitutive and reprogrammed cancer stem cells driving cancer metastasis.
2	Thus, the metastatic process in colorectal cancer is initiated by CSCs through the expression of CD44v6, which is both a functional biomarker and therapeutic target.	CD44v6 is not associated with constitutive and reprogrammed cancer stem cells driving cancer metastasis.

0	Through comparative analysis of expression in platelets and other blood cells we demonstrated that G6b, G6f, and LRRC32 are restricted to the platelet lineage, whereas LAT2 and SUCNR1 were also detected in other blood cells.The identification of the succinate receptor SUCNR1 in platelets is of particular interest, because physiologically relevant concentrations of succinate were shown to potentiate the effect of low doses of a variety of platelet agonists.	Comparative transcriptome analysis identified new platelet proteins with structural features suggesting a role in platelet function.
1	To identify previously unknown platelet receptors we compared the transcriptomes of in vitro differentiated megakaryocytes (MKs) and erythroblasts (EBs).	Comparative transcriptome analysis identified new platelet proteins with structural features suggesting a role in platelet function.

2	The mean costs (for GPRD events) over calendar time were US$58k during 1990-1993 and US$174k during 2002-2005.Using RCT data rather than GPRD data for event probabilities, the mean cost was US$16k with the VIGOR RCT and US$20k with the CLASS RCT.	Cost effectiveness evaluations based on cRCT data accurately reflect prices for patients in actual clinical practice.
2	CONCLUSIONS The published cost-effectiveness analyses of coxibs lacked external validity, did not represent patients in actual clinical practice, and should not have been used to inform prescribing policies.	Cost effectiveness evaluations based on cRCT data accurately reflect prices for patients in actual clinical practice.
1	The mean cost of preventing one upper GI event as recorded in GPRD was US$104k (ranging from US$64k with long-term daily use to US$182k with intermittent use) and US$298k for hospitalizations.	Cost effectiveness evaluations based on cRCT data accurately reflect prices for patients in actual clinical practice.
1	A basic cost-effectiveness model was developed evaluating two alternative strategies: prescription of a conventional NSAID or coxib.	Cost effectiveness evaluations based on cRCT data accurately reflect prices for patients in actual clinical practice.
1	The objective of this study was to evaluate the external validity of published cost-effectiveness studies by comparing the data used in these studies (typically based on RCTs) to observational data from actual clinical practice.	Cost effectiveness evaluations based on cRCT data accurately reflect prices for patients in actual clinical practice.
0	Only a minority of patients used the drugs long-term and daily (34.5% of conventional NSAIDs and 44.2% of coxibs), whereas coxib RCTs required daily use for at least 6-9 months.	Cost effectiveness evaluations based on cRCT data lack external validity.

0	The switch to more stable k-MT attachments in metaphase requires the proteasome-dependent destruction of cyclin A in prometaphase.	Cyclin A2 destruction is necessary to switch from unstable to stable kt-mt attachments in mitosis.
0	Persistent cyclin A expression prevents k-MT stabilization even in cells with aligned chromosomes.	Cyclin A2 destruction is necessary to switch from unstable to stable kt-mt attachments in mitosis.
0	By contrast, k-MTs are prematurely stabilized in cyclin-A-deficient cells.	Cyclin A2 destruction is necessary to switch from unstable to stable kt-mt attachments in mitosis.
1	Cyclin A creates a cellular environment that promotes microtubule detachment from kinetochores in prometaphase to ensure efficient error correction and faithful chromosome segregation.	Cyclin A2 destruction is necessary to switch from unstable to stable kt-mt attachments in mitosis.
1	Chromosome alignment fosters faithful segregation through the formation of bi-oriented attachments of kinetochores to spindle microtubules.	Cyclin A2 destruction is necessary to switch from unstable to stable kt-mt attachments in mitosis.
1	Consequently, cells lacking cyclin A display higher rates of chromosome mis-segregation.	Cyclin A2 destruction is necessary to switch from unstable to stable kt-mt attachments in mitosis.
2	Apoptosis that proceeds via the mitochondrial pathway involves mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), responsible for the release of cytochrome c and other proteins of the mitochondrial intermembrane space.	Cytochrome c is transferred from cytosol to the mitochondrial intermembrane space during apoptosis.
1	Here, we discuss an emerging view, proposed by Certo et al. in this issue of Cancer Cell, on how these interactions result in MOMP and apoptosis.	Cytochrome c is transferred from cytosol to the mitochondrial intermembrane space during apoptosis.
0	Pol IVb/Pol V transcription requires the chromatin-remodeling protein DRD1 but is independent of siRNA biogenesis.	DRD1 proteins enable Pol V transcription in vivo.
1	However, Pol IVb/Pol V transcription and siRNA production are both required to silence transposons, suggesting that Pol IVb/Pol V generates RNAs or chromatin structures that serve as scaffolds for siRNA-mediated heterochromatin-forming complexes.	DRD1 proteins enable Pol V transcription in vivo.
2	DUSP4 overexpression increased chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, whereas DUSP4 depletion dampened the response to chemotherapy.	DUSP4 decreases apoptosis.
1	Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) induces a pathological complete response (pCR) in ∼30% of patients with breast cancer.	DUSP4 decreases apoptosis.
2	Low concentrations of dual specificity protein phosphatase 4 (DUSP4), an ERK phosphatase, correlated with high post-NAC tumor cell proliferation and with basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) status.BLBC had higher DUSP4 promoter methylation and gene expression patterns of Ras-ERK pathway activation relative to other breast cancer subtypes.	DUSP4 downregulation deactivates the Ras-ERK pathway
2	Thus, DUSP4 downregulation activates the Ras-ERK pathway in BLBC, resulting in an attenuated response to anti-cancer chemotherapy.	DUSP4 downregulation deactivates the Ras-ERK pathway
1	Digital transcript counting was used to profile surgically resected breast cancers after NAC.	DUSP4 downregulation deactivates the Ras-ERK pathway
1	However, many patients have residual cancer after chemotherapy, which correlates with a higher risk of metastatic recurrence and poorer outcome than those who achieve a pCR.	DUSP4 downregulation deactivates the Ras-ERK pathway

2	Compared with diastolic blood pressure, raised systolic blood pressure had a greater effect on angina, myocardial infarction, and peripheral arterial disease, whereas raised diastolic blood pressure had a greater effect on abdominal aortic aneurysm than did raised systolic pressure.	Decreased diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm.
1	Pulse pressure associations were inverse for abdominal aortic aneurysm (HR per 10 mm Hg 0·91 [95% CI 0·86-0·98]) and strongest for peripheral arterial disease (1·23 [1·20-1·27]).	Decreased diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm.

2	Here we show that simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection results in depletion of T helper type 17 (TH17) cells in the ileal mucosa of rhesus macaques, thereby impairing mucosal barrier functions to S. typhimurium dissemination.	Depletion of T-helper 17 (Th17) cells during simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection decreases dissemination of Salmonella Typhimurium from the gut.
2	TH17 cells were markedly depleted in SIV-infected rhesus macaques, resulting in blunted TH17 responses to S. typhimurium infection and increased bacterial dissemination.	Depletion of T-helper 17 (Th17) cells during simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection decreases dissemination of Salmonella Typhimurium from the gut.
1	IL-17 receptor–deficient mice showed increased systemic dissemination of S. typhimurium from the gut, suggesting that IL-17 deficiency causes defects in mucosal barrier function.	Depletion of T-helper 17 (Th17) cells during simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection decreases dissemination of Salmonella Typhimurium from the gut.
1	In SIV-negative macaques, the gene expression profile induced by S. typhimurium in ligated ileal loops was dominated by TH17 responses, including the expression of interleukin-17 (IL-17) and IL-22.	Depletion of T-helper 17 (Th17) cells during simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection decreases dissemination of Salmonella Typhimurium from the gut.

1	We conclude that SIV infection impairs the IL-17 axis, an arm of the mucosal immune response preventing systemic microbial dissemination from the gastrointestinal tract.	Depletion of T-helper 17 (Th17) cells during simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection increases dissemination of Salmonella Typhimurium from the gut.

Diabetes remission occurs more in people treated with conventional therapy than in people treated with laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding surgery.
2	Diabetes independently predicted mortality (relative risk [RR], 1.57; 95% CI, 1.38 to 1.81; P:<0.001), as well as cardiovascular death, new myocardial infarction, stroke, and new congestive heart failure.	Diabetic patients with acute coronary syndrome experience decreased short-term and long-term risk for bleeding events.

Diabetic patients with acute coronary syndrome experience decreased short-term and long-term risk for bleeding events.
2	Here, we show that the haematopoietic progenitors of Drosophila are direct targets of systemic (insulin) and nutritional (essential amino acid) signals, and that these systemic signals maintain the progenitors by promoting Wingless (WNT in mammals) signalling.	Differentiation of progenitor cells to myeloid cells is skewed upon activation of insulin signaling.
1	During the first and early second instars of larval development, the lymph gland contains only progenitors, whereas in the third instar, a medial region of the primary lobe of the lymph gland called the medullary zone contains these progenitors, and maturing blood cells are found juxtaposed in a peripheral region designated the cortical zone.	Differentiation of progenitor cells to myeloid cells is skewed upon activation of insulin signaling.
0	Here, we show that the haematopoietic progenitors of Drosophila are direct targets of systemic (insulin) and nutritional (essential amino acid) signals, and that these systemic signals maintain the progenitors by promoting Wingless (WNT in mammals) signalling.	Differentiation of progenitor cells to myeloid cells is skewed when insulin signaling is suppressed.
1	However, how systemic signals are sensed by myeloid progenitors to regulate cell-fate determination has not been well described.	Differentiation of progenitor cells to myeloid cells is skewed when insulin signaling is suppressed.
2	After adjusting for age, body mass index, race, current smoking status, and recent hormonal contraceptive use, women with low AMH values (<0.7 ng/mL [n = 84]) did not have a significantly different predicted probability of conceiving by 6 cycles of attempt (65%; 95% CI, 50%-75%) compared with women (n = 579) with normal values (62%; 95% CI, 57%-66%) or by 12 cycles of attempt (84% [95% CI, 70%-91%] vs 75% [95% CI, 70%-79%], respectively).	Diminished ovarian reserve is a reliable indicator of infertility in a non-infertile population.
2	Women with high serum FSH values (>10 mIU/mL [n = 83]) did not have a significantly different predicted probability of conceiving after 6 cycles of attempt (63%; 95% CI, 50%-73%) compared with women (n = 654) with normal values (62%; 95% CI, 57%-66%) or after 12 cycles of attempt (82% [95% CI, 70%-89%] vs 75% [95% CI, 70%-78%], respectively).	Diminished ovarian reserve is a reliable indicator of infertility in a non-infertile population.
2	Women with high urinary FSH values (>11.5 mIU/mg creatinine [n = 69]) did not have a significantly different predicted probability of conceiving after 6 cycles of attempt (61%; 95% CI, 46%-74%) compared with women (n = 660) with normal values (62%; 95% CI, 58%-66%) or after 12 cycles of attempt (70% [95% CI, 54%-80%] vs 76% [95% CI, 72%-80%], respectively).	Diminished ovarian reserve is a reliable indicator of infertility in a non-infertile population.
2	Conclusions and Relevance Among women aged 30 to 44 years without a history of infertility who had been trying to conceive for 3 months or less, biomarkers indicating diminished ovarian reserve compared with normal ovarian reserve were not associated with reduced fertility.	Diminished ovarian reserve is a reliable indicator of infertility in a non-infertile population.
1	These findings do not support the use of urinary or blood follicle-stimulating hormone tests or antimüllerian hormone levels to assess natural fertility for women with these characteristics.	Diminished ovarian reserve is a reliable indicator of infertility in a non-infertile population.

1	Design, Setting, and Participants Prospective time-to-pregnancy cohort study (2008 to date of last follow-up in March 2016) of women (N = 981) aged 30 to 44 years without a history of infertility who had been trying to conceive for 3 months or less, recruited from the community in the Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina, area.	Diminished ovarian reserve is a reliable indicator of infertility in a non-infertile population.
1	Importance Despite lack of evidence of their utility, biomarkers of ovarian reserve are being promoted as potential markers of reproductive potential.	Diminished ovarian reserve is a reliable indicator of infertility in a non-infertile population.
0	Our results provide a physical mechanism in which the local increase in Myosin II-dependent cell bond tension directs cell sorting at compartment boundaries.	Drosophila supracellular actomyosin structures are found at boundaries in wing imaginal discs.

Elevated cell-free mitochondrial DNA levels are associated with mortality.
0	In the BWH RoCI cohort, those with an elevated mtDNA level had an increased risk of death, even in analyses limited to patients with sepsis or acute respiratory distress syndrome.	Elevated cell-free mitochondrial DNA levels are associated with mortality.
0	CONCLUSIONS Increased mtDNA levels are associated with ICU mortality, and inclusion of mtDNA level improves risk prediction in medical ICU patients.	Elevated cell-free mitochondrial DNA levels are associated with mortality.
1	We hypothesized that circulating cell-free mtDNA levels would be associated with mortality and improve risk prediction in ICU patients.	Elevated cell-free mitochondrial DNA levels are associated with mortality.

0	The anti-obesity effect was completely reversed by selective disruption of glutamate release from those same Sim1 neurons.	Energy balance requires hypothalamic glutamate neurotransmission.
0	Corroboratively, selective disruption of glutamate release from adult PVH neurons led to rapid obesity development via reduced energy expenditure and hyperphagia.	Energy balance requires hypothalamic glutamate neurotransmission.
0	Thus, this study establishes glutamate as the primary neurotransmitter that mediates MC4Rs on Sim1 neurons in body weight regulation.	Energy balance requires hypothalamic glutamate neurotransmission.
1	The melanocortin receptor 4 (MC4R) is a well-established mediator of body weight homeostasis.	Energy balance requires hypothalamic glutamate neurotransmission.
1	However, the neurotransmitter(s) that mediate MC4R function remain largely unknown; as a result, little is known about the second-order neurons of the MC4R neural pathway.	Energy balance requires hypothalamic glutamate neurotransmission.
1	The reversal was caused by lower energy expenditure and hyperphagia.	Energy balance requires hypothalamic glutamate neurotransmission.
0	Deletion of NMDARs from AgRP neurons markedly reduced weight, body fat and food intake whereas deletion from POMC neurons had no effect.	Energy balance requires hypothalamic glutamate neurotransmission.
0	Activation of AgRP neurons by fasting, as assessed by c-Fos, Agrp and Npy mRNA expression, AMPA receptor-mediated EPSCs, depolarization and firing rates, required NMDARs.	Energy balance requires hypothalamic glutamate neurotransmission.
0	Furthermore, AgRP but not POMC neurons have dendritic spines and increased glutamatergic input onto AgRP neurons caused by fasting was paralleled by an increase in spines, suggesting fasting induced synaptogenesis and spinogenesis.	Energy balance requires hypothalamic glutamate neurotransmission.
0	Thus glutamatergic synaptic transmission and its modulation by NMDARs play key roles in controlling AgRP neurons and determining the cellular and behavioral response to fasting.	Energy balance requires hypothalamic glutamate neurotransmission.

2	We found that the response of memory, but not naive, CD4+ T cells enhances production of multiple innate inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (IICs) in the lung and that, during influenza infection, this leads to early control of virus.	Enhanced early production of inflammatory chemokines damages viral control in the lung.
1	Memory CD4+ T cell–induced IICs and viral control require cognate antigen recognition and are optimal when memory cells are either T helper type 1 (TH1) or TH17 polarized but are independent of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) production and do not require activation of conserved pathogen recognition pathways.

Environmental factors can influence the development of breast cancer.
0	INTERPRETATION Risks of breast cancer associated with low-penetrance susceptibility polymorphisms do not vary significantly with these ten established environmental risk factors.	Environmental factors can influence the development of breast cancer.
1	BACKGROUND Information is scarce about the combined effects on breast cancer incidence of low-penetrance genetic susceptibility polymorphisms and environmental factors (reproductive, behavioural, and anthropometric risk factors for breast cancer).	Environmental factors can influence the development of breast cancer.
1	By contrast with previous suggestions, there was little evidence that the genotypic relative risks were affected by use of hormone replacement therapy, either overall or for oestrogen-receptor-positive disease.	Environmental factors can influence the development of breast cancer.
0	In this study, we describe a strategy for inducing aging-related features in human iPSC-derived lineages and apply it to the modeling of Parkinson's disease (PD).Our approach involves expression of progerin, a truncated form of lamin A associated with premature aging.	Environmentally-induced senescence is mimicked in disease modeling by adding specific molecules to the culture system.
0	Induced aging in PD iPSC-derived dopamine neurons revealed disease phenotypes that require both aging and genetic susceptibility, such as pronounced dendrite degeneration, progressive loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression, and enlarged mitochondria or Lewy-body-precursor inclusions.Thus, our study suggests that progerin-induced aging can be used to reveal late-onset age-related disease features in hiPSC-based disease models.	Environmentally-induced senescence is mimicked in disease modeling by adding specific molecules to the culture system.

2	Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a childhood premature aging disease caused by a spontaneous point mutation in lamin A (encoded by LMNA), one of the major architectural elements of the mammalian cell nucleus.The mutant LMNA mRNA and lamin A protein can be efficiently eliminated by correction of the aberrant splicing event using a modified oligonucleotide targeted to the activated cryptic splice site.Upon splicing correction, HGPS fibroblasts assume normal nuclear morphology, the aberrant nuclear distribution and cellular levels of lamina-associated proteins are rescued, defects in heterochromatin-specific histone modifications are corrected and proper expression of several misregulated genes is reestablished.

0	Here we show that the degree of LAV-mediated protection against intravenous wild-type SIVmac239 challenge strongly correlates with the magnitude and function of SIV-specific, effector-differentiated T cells in the lymph node but not with the responses of such T cells in the blood or with other cellular, humoral and innate immune parameters.

2	Alpha(+)-thalassaemia homozygosity confers considerable protection against severe malaria, including severe malarial anaemia (SMA) (Hb concentration < 50 g/l), but does not influence parasite count.	Patients with microcytosis and higher erythrocyte count are more vulnerable to severe malarial anaemia when infected with Plasmodium falciparum.
2	We estimated that the haematological profile in children homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia reduces the risk of SMA during acute malaria compared to children of normal genotype (relative risk 0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.24-1.12, p = 0.09).	Patients with microcytosis and higher erythrocyte count are more vulnerable to severe malarial anaemia when infected with Plasmodium falciparum.
2	CONCLUSIONS The increased erythrocyte count and microcytosis in children homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia may contribute substantially to their protection against SMA.	Patients with microcytosis and higher erythrocyte count are more vulnerable to severe malarial anaemia when infected with Plasmodium falciparum.
1	In addition, children homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia require a 10% greater reduction in erythrocyte count than children of normal genotype (p = 0.02) for Hb concentration to fall to 50 g/l, the cutoff for SMA.

0	In order to test directly that an approximately twofold reduction in IL-2 underpins the Idd3-linked destabilization of immune homeostasis, we show that engineered haplodeficiency of Il2 gene expression not only reduces T cell IL-2 production by twofold but also mimics the autoimmune dysregulatory effects of the naturally occurring susceptibility alleles of Il2.Reduced IL-2 production achieved by either genetic mechanism correlates with reduced function of CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T cells, which are critical for maintaining immune homeostasis.	Reduced responsiveness to interleukin-2 in regulatory T cells is associated with autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 Diabetes.
0	We demonstrated that the presence of an autoimmune disease-associated IL2RA haplotype correlates with diminished IL-2 responsiveness in Ag-experienced CD4(+) T cells, as measured by phosphorylation of STAT5a, and is associated with lower levels of FOXP3 expression by Tregs and a reduction in their ability to suppress proliferation of autologous effector T cells.

2	A detailed analysis of multiple muscles harvested at various time points during aging in different cohorts of these mice showed that the muscles were of normal size, despite low regenerative capacity, but did have increased fibrosis.	Satellite cell dysfunction is a key factor in sarcopenia development.
2	These results suggest that lifelong reduction of satellite cells neither accelerated nor exacerbated sarcopenia and that satellite cells did not contribute to the maintenance of muscle size or fiber type composition during aging, but that their loss may contribute to age-related muscle fibrosis.	Satellite cell dysfunction is a key factor in sarcopenia development.
1	Although the etiology of sarcopenia is unknown, the correlation during aging between the loss of activity of satellite cells, which are endogenous muscle stem cells, and impaired muscle regenerative capacity has led to the hypothesis that the loss of satellite cell activity is also a cause of sarcopenia.	Satellite cell dysfunction is a key factor in sarcopenia development.
1	We tested this hypothesis in male sedentary mice by experimentally depleting satellite cells in young adult animals to a degree sufficient to impair regeneration throughout the rest of their lives.	Satellite cell dysfunction is a key factor in sarcopenia development.

0	CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with displaced proximal humeral fractures involving the surgical neck, there was no significant difference between surgical treatment compared with nonsurgical treatment in patient-reported clinical outcomes over 2 years following fracture occurrence.	Surgical treatment is not superior to non-surgical in treating adults with displaced fractures of the proximal humerus.
1	IMPORTANCE The need for surgery for the majority of patients with displaced proximal humeral fractures is unclear, but its use is increasing.	Surgical treatment is not superior to non-surgical in treating adults with displaced fractures of the proximal humerus.
1	Sample size was based on a minimal clinically important difference of 5 points for the Oxford Shoulder Score.	Surgical treatment is not superior to non-surgical in treating adults with displaced fractures of the proximal humerus.
1	INTERVENTIONS Fracture fixation or humeral head replacement were performed by surgeons experienced in these techniques.	Surgical treatment is not superior to non-surgical in treating adults with displaced fractures of the proximal humerus.
1	Standardized outpatient and community-based rehabilitation was provided to both groups.	Surgical treatment is not superior to non-surgical in treating adults with displaced fractures of the proximal humerus.
0	The s-MSNA in NP (38+/-6.6 impulses/100 beats) was greater (P<0.05) than in NN women (19+/-1.8 impulses/100 beats) despite similar age and body weight but less than in PIH women (P<0.001) (146+/-23.5 impulses/100 beats).	Sympathetic nerve activity is elevated throughout normal pregnancy.
0	The findings suggest that the moderate sympathetic hyperactivity during the latter months of normal pregnancy may help to return the arterial pressure to nonpregnant levels, although when the increase in activity is excessive, hypertension may ensue.	Sympathetic nerve activity is elevated throughout normal pregnancy.
1	After delivery, sympathetic activity decreased to values similar to those obtained in NN, and there was an increase in BRS.	Sympathetic nerve activity is elevated throughout normal pregnancy.
1	METHODS AND RESULTS Twenty-one women with NP, 18 women with PIH, and 21 NN women had muscle sympathetic nerve activity assessed from multiunit discharges (MSNA) and from single units with defined vasoconstrictor properties (s-MSNA).	Sympathetic nerve activity is elevated throughout normal pregnancy.
0	Muscle sympathetic nerve activity is increased during normotensive pregnancy while mean arterial pressure is maintained or reduced, suggesting baroreflex resetting.	Sympathetic nerve activity is elevated throughout normal pregnancy.
0	Pregnant women had elevated baseline sympathetic burst incidence (43 ± 2 vs. 33 ± 2 bursts/100 heart beats, P = 0.01) and total sympathetic activity (1,811 ± 148 vs. 1,140 ± 55 au, P < 0.01) relative to controls.	Sympathetic nerve activity is elevated throughout normal pregnancy.
1	We hypothesized spontaneous sympathetic baroreflex gain would be reduced in normotensive pregnant women relative to nonpregnant matched controls.	Sympathetic nerve activity is elevated throughout normal pregnancy.
1	However, sympathetic (burst incidence) and cardiovagal gains were negatively correlated in pregnant women (R = -0.7; P = 0.02).	Sympathetic nerve activity is elevated throughout normal pregnancy.
0	Sympathetic activation was greater across all 3 minutes of cold pressor stimulation in the pregnant women relative to the nonpregnant controls.	Sympathetic nerve activity is elevated throughout normal pregnancy.
0	Peak sympathoexcitation was also greater in pregnant than in nonpregnant women, whether expressed as sympathetic burst frequency (+17±13 versus +7±8 bursts/min, P=0.049), burst incidence (+17±9 versus +6±11 bursts/100 hb, P=0.03), or total activity (+950±660 versus +363±414 arbitrary units, P=0.04).	Sympathetic nerve activity is elevated throughout normal pregnancy.
1	We tested the hypothesis that, despite an exacerbated muscle sympathetic nerve activity (microneurography) response to cold pressor stimulation, the blunting of neurovascular transduction in normotensive pregnant women would result in similar changes in vascular resistance and mean arterial pressure (Finometer) relative to nonpregnant controls.	Sympathetic nerve activity is elevated throughout normal pregnancy.
1	Baseline neurovascular transduction is reduced in normotensive pregnancy; however, little is known about changes to neurovascular transduction during periods of heightened sympathetic activation.	Sympathetic nerve activity is elevated throughout normal pregnancy.
2	The s-MSNA in NP (38+/-6.6 impulses/100 beats) was greater (P<0.05) than in NN women (19+/-1.8 impulses/100 beats) despite similar age and body weight but less than in PIH women (P<0.001) (146+/-23.5 impulses/100 beats).	Sympathetic nerve activity is reduced throughout normal pregnancy.

Sympathetic nerve activity is reduced throughout normal pregnancy.
1	After delivery, sympathetic activity decreased to values similar to those obtained in NN, and there was an increase in BRS.	Sympathetic nerve activity is reduced throughout normal pregnancy.
1	BACKGROUND Direct recordings from peripheral sympathetic nerves have shown an increased sympathetic drive in pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) and preeclampsia (PE).	Sympathetic nerve activity is reduced throughout normal pregnancy.
2	Muscle sympathetic nerve activity is increased during normotensive pregnancy while mean arterial pressure is maintained or reduced, suggesting baroreflex resetting.	Sympathetic nerve activity is reduced throughout normal pregnancy.
2	Pregnant women had elevated baseline sympathetic burst incidence (43 ± 2 vs. 33 ± 2 bursts/100 heart beats, P = 0.01) and total sympathetic activity (1,811 ± 148 vs. 1,140 ± 55 au, P < 0.01) relative to controls.	Sympathetic nerve activity is reduced throughout normal pregnancy.
1	However, sympathetic (burst incidence) and cardiovagal gains were negatively correlated in pregnant women (R = -0.7; P = 0.02).	Sympathetic nerve activity is reduced throughout normal pregnancy.
1	Cardiovagal baroreflex gain (sequence method) was not different between nonpregnant controls and pregnant women (49 ± 8 vs. 36 ± 8 ms/mmHg; P = 0.2).	Sympathetic nerve activity is reduced throughout normal pregnancy.
2	Sympathetic activation was greater across all 3 minutes of cold pressor stimulation in the pregnant women relative to the nonpregnant controls.	Sympathetic nerve activity is reduced throughout normal pregnancy.
2	Peak sympathoexcitation was also greater in pregnant than in nonpregnant women, whether expressed as sympathetic burst frequency (+17±13 versus +7±8 bursts/min, P=0.049), burst incidence (+17±9 versus +6±11 bursts/100 hb, P=0.03), or total activity (+950±660 versus +363±414 arbitrary units, P=0.04).	Sympathetic nerve activity is reduced throughout normal pregnancy.
1	These data indicate that the third trimester of normotensive pregnancy is associated with reductions in neurovascular transduction, which result in the dissociation of sympathetic outflow from hemodynamic outcomes, even during cold pressor-induced sympathoexcitation.	Sympathetic nerve activity is reduced throughout normal pregnancy.

0	The 20% SSB tax was anticipated to reduce overweight and obesity prevalence by 3.0% (95% CI 1.6%-5.9%) and type 2 diabetes incidence by 1.6% (95% CI 1.2%-1.9%) among various Indian subpopulations over the period 2014-2023, if SSB consumption continued to increase linearly in accordance with secular trends.	Taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages reduced the incidence rate of type II diabetes in India.
0	However, acceleration in SSB consumption trends consistent with industry marketing models would be expected to increase the impact efficacy of taxation, averting 4.2% of prevalent overweight/obesity (95% CI 2.5-10.0%) and 2.5% (95% CI 1.0-2.8%) of incident type 2 diabetes from 2014-2023.	Taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages reduced the incidence rate of type II diabetes in India.
0	CONCLUSION Sustained SSB taxation at a high tax rate could mitigate rising obesity and type 2 diabetes in India among both urban and rural subpopulations.	Taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages reduced the incidence rate of type II diabetes in India.
1	We sought to estimate the potential health effects of such a fiscal strategy in the middle-income country of India, where there is heterogeneity in SSB consumption, patterns of substitution between SSBs and other beverages after tax increases, and vast differences in chronic disease risk within the population.	Taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages reduced the incidence rate of type II diabetes in India.
1	We then incorporated SSB sales trends, body mass index (BMI), and diabetes incidence data stratified by age, sex, income, and urban/rural residence into a validated microsimulation of caloric consumption, glycemic load, overweight/obesity prevalence, and type 2 diabetes incidence among Indian subpopulations facing a 20% SSB excise tax.	Taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages reduced the incidence rate of type II diabetes in India.
1	Key limitations of this estimation approach include the assumption that consumer expenditure behavior from prior years, captured in price elasticities, will reflect future behavior among consumers, and potential underreporting of consumption in dietary recall data used to inform our calculations.	Taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages reduced the incidence rate of type II diabetes in India.

0	Here we showed that emergence of the first cohorts of Aire(+) mTECs at this key developmental stage, prior to αβ T cell repertoire selection, was jointly directed by Rankl(+) lymphoid tissue inducer cells and invariant Vγ5(+) dendritic epidermal T cell (DETC) progenitors that are the first thymocytes to express the products of gene rearrangement.

0	APOBEC3G is closely related to APOBEC1, the central component of an RNA-editing complex that deaminates a cytosine residue in apoB messenger RNA.Here, we demonstrate that it does, as APOBEC3G exerts its antiviral effect during reverse transcription to trigger G-to-A hypermutation in the nascent retroviral DNA.	The deamination of cytidine to uridine on the minus strand of viral DNA can inactivate the viral genome by inducing G-to-A mutations.

2	We found that the response of memory, but not naive, CD4+ T cells enhances production of multiple innate inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (IICs) in the lung and that, during influenza infection, this leads to early control of virus.	Upon viral challenge, influenza-specific memory CD4+ T cells greatly diminish the early production of inflammatory chemokines in the lung.
1	Memory CD4+ T cell–induced IICs and viral control require cognate antigen recognition and are optimal when memory cells are either T helper type 1 (TH1) or TH17 polarized but are independent of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) production and do not require activation of conserved pathogen recognition pathways.	Upon viral challenge, influenza-specific memory CD4+ T cells greatly diminish the early production of inflammatory chemokines in the lung.

0	Here, we show that expression of the orphan G protein-coupled receptor Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 2 (EBI2, also known as GPR183) by activated B cells was essential for their movement to extrafollicular sites and induction of early plasmablast responses.Conversely, downregulation of EBI2 enabled B cells to access the center of follicles and promoted efficient GC formation.	Varying expression levels of EBI2 affect the positioning and migration of B cells.
1	EBI2 therefore provides a previously uncharacterized dimension to B cell migration that is crucial for coordinating rapid versus long-term antibody responses.	Varying expression levels of EBI2 affect the positioning and migration of B cells.
1	This is achieved by the generation of spatially distinct extrafollicular plasmablast and follicular germinal center (GC) B cell populations, but the signals that guide responding B cells to these alternative compartments have not been fully elucidated.	Varying expression levels of EBI2 affect the positioning and migration of B cells.
0	A few subsequently published studies further elucidated how 7α, 25-OHC bound to EBI2, and how a gradient of 7α, 25-OHC could be generated in vivo and regulated migration, activation, and functions of B cells, T cells, dendritic cells (DCs), monocytes/macrophages, and astrocytes.	Varying expression levels of EBI2 affect the positioning and migration of B cells.
1	EBI2, aka GPR183, is a G-couple receptor originally identified in 1993 as one of main genes induced in Burkitt's lymphoma cell line BL41 by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection.	Varying expression levels of EBI2 affect the positioning and migration of B cells.

2	Birth weight was positively associated with breast cancer risk in studies based on birth records (pooled relative risk [RR] per one standard deviation [SD] [= 0.5 kg] increment in birth weight: 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.09) and parental recall when the participants were children (1.02; 95% CI 0.99-1.05), but not in those based on adult self-reports, or maternal recall during the woman's adulthood (0.98; 95% CI 0.95-1.01) (p for heterogeneity between data sources = 0.003).	Women with a lower birth weight are more likely to develop breast cancer later in life.
2	Relative to women who weighed 3.000-3.499 kg, the risk was 0.96 (CI 0.80-1.16) in those who weighed < 2.500 kg, and 1.12 (95% CI 1.00-1.25) in those who weighed > or = 4.000 kg (p for linear trend = 0.001) in birth record data.	Women with a lower birth weight are more likely to develop breast cancer later in life.
1	Simultaneous adjustment for these three birth size variables showed that length was the strongest independent predictor of risk.	Women with a lower birth weight are more likely to develop breast cancer later in life.
1	The birth size effects did not appear to be confounded or mediated by established breast cancer risk factors and were not modified by age or menopausal status.	Women with a lower birth weight are more likely to develop breast cancer later in life.
2	Increased risk of breast cancer was noted with increased birthweight (relative risk [RR] 1.15 [95% CI 1.09-1.21]), birth length (1.28 [1.11-1.48]), higher maternal age (1.13 [1.02-1.25]), and paternal age (1.12 [1.05-1.19]).	Women with a lower birth weight are more likely to develop breast cancer later in life.
1	No association was noted between risk of breast cancer and gestational age at birth (0.95 [0.71-1.26]) or maternal diethylstilbestrol treatment (1.40 [0.86-2.28]).	Women with a lower birth weight are more likely to develop breast cancer later in life.
2	RESULTS We found that heavier birth weights were associated with increased breast cancer risk, with studies involving five categories of birth weight identifying odds ratios (ORs) of 1.24 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04 to 1.48) for 4,000 g or more and 1.15 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.26) for 3,500 g to 3,999 g, relative to a birth weight of 2,500 to 2,599 g. These studies provided no support for a J-shaped relationship of birthweight to risk.	Women with a lower birth weight are more likely to develop breast cancer later in life.
1	CONCLUSION Our findings provide some support for the hypothesis that in utero exposures reflective of higher endogenous hormone levels could affect risk for development of breast cancer in adulthood.	Women with a lower birth weight are more likely to develop breast cancer later in life.
0	The fate change is orchestrated by remodeling the extracellular matrix (ECM), increased FAK/Src signaling, and ultimately YAP/TAZ activation.	YAP/TAZ is required in intestinal regeneration in mouse models of ulcerative colitis.
