0	We propose as an alternative explanation that variants much less common than the associated one may create "synthetic associations" by occurring, stochastically, more often in association with one of the alleles at the common site versus the other allele.We show that they are not only possible, but inevitable, and that under simple but reasonable genetic models, they are likely to account for or contribute to many of the recently identified signals reported in genome-wide association studies.	1,000 genomes project enables mapping of genetic sequence variation consisting of rare variants with larger penetrance effects than common variants.
0	In conclusion, uncommon or rare genetic variants can easily create synthetic associations that are credited to common variants, and this possibility requires careful consideration in the interpretation and follow up of GWAS signals.	1,000 genomes project enables mapping of genetic sequence variation consisting of rare variants with larger penetrance effects than common variants.
1	Here, we use simple computer simulations to show the conditions under which such synthetic associations will arise and how they may be recognized.	1,000 genomes project enables mapping of genetic sequence variation consisting of rare variants with larger penetrance effects than common variants.
1	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have now identified at least 2,000 common variants that appear associated with common diseases or related traits (http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies), hundreds of which have been convincingly replicated.	1,000 genomes project enables mapping of genetic sequence variation consisting of rare variants with larger penetrance effects than common variants.
1	It is generally thought that the associated markers reflect the effect of a nearby common (minor allele frequency >0.05) causal site, which is associated with the marker, leading to extensive resequencing efforts to find causal sites.	1,000 genomes project enables mapping of genetic sequence variation consisting of rare variants with larger penetrance effects than common variants.
0	RESULTS Of the 32,441 appendix samples 16 were positive for abnormal PrP, indicating an overall prevalence of 493 per million population (95% confidence interval 282 to 801 per million).	1/2000 in UK have abnormal PrP positivity.
1	CONCLUSIONS This study corroborates previous studies and suggests a high prevalence of infection with abnormal PrP, indicating vCJD carrier status in the population compared with the 177 vCJD cases to date.	1/2000 in UK have abnormal PrP positivity.
2	Individuals homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia have microcytosis and an increased erythrocyte count.We estimated that the haematological profile in children homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia reduces the risk of SMA during acute malaria compared to children of normal genotype (relative risk 0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.24-1.12, p = 0.09).	A high microerythrocyte count raises vulnerability to severe anemia in homozygous alpha (+)- thalassemia trait subjects.
2	CONCLUSIONS The increased erythrocyte count and microcytosis in children homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia may contribute substantially to their protection against SMA.	A high microerythrocyte count raises vulnerability to severe anemia in homozygous alpha (+)- thalassemia trait subjects.
1	In addition, children homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia require a 10% greater reduction in erythrocyte count than children of normal genotype (p = 0.02) for Hb concentration to fall to 50 g/l, the cutoff for SMA.	A high microerythrocyte count raises vulnerability to severe anemia in homozygous alpha (+)- thalassemia trait subjects.
1	We observed a reduction in median erythrocyte count of approximately 1.5 x 10(12)/l in all children with acute falciparum malaria relative to values in community children (p < 0.001).	A high microerythrocyte count raises vulnerability to severe anemia in homozygous alpha (+)- thalassemia trait subjects.
1	We tested the hypothesis that the erythrocyte indices associated with alpha(+)-thalassaemia homozygosity provide a haematological benefit during acute malaria.	A high microerythrocyte count raises vulnerability to severe anemia in homozygous alpha (+)- thalassemia trait subjects.
2	RESULTS Of the 32,441 appendix samples 16 were positive for abnormal PrP, indicating an overall prevalence of 493 per million population (95% confidence interval 282 to 801 per million).	A total of 1,000 people in the UK are asymptomatic carriers of vCJD infection.

0	In this study, we investigated the interaction of the RNA editing mechanism with the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery and found that ADAR1 forms a complex with Dicer through direct protein-protein interaction.	ADAR1 binds to Dicer to cleave pre-miRNA.
0	Most importantly, ADAR1 increases the maximum rate (Vmax) of pre-microRNA (miRNA) cleavage by Dicer and facilitates loading of miRNA onto RNA-induced silencing complexes, identifying a new role of ADAR1 in miRNA processing and RNAi mechanisms.	ADAR1 binds to Dicer to cleave pre-miRNA.
1	Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) are involved in RNA editing that converts adenosine residues to inosine specifically in double-stranded RNAs.	ADAR1 binds to Dicer to cleave pre-miRNA.
1	As expected, the expression of miRNAs is globally inhibited in ADAR1(-/-) mouse embryos, which, in turn, alters the expression of their target genes and might contribute to their embryonic lethal phenotype.	ADAR1 binds to Dicer to cleave pre-miRNA.
0	We report that autoimmune regulator (Aire), a transcriptional regulator, is inducibly expressed in human and mouse tumor keratinocytes in a K17-dependent manner and is required for timely onset of Gli2-induced skin tumorigenesis in mice.	AIRE is expressed in some skin tumors.
1	The induction of Aire mRNA in keratinocytes depends on a functional interaction between K17 and the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein hnRNP K. Further, K17 colocalizes with Aire protein in the nucleus of tumor-prone keratinocytes, and each factor is bound to a specific promoter region featuring an NF-κB consensus sequence in a relevant subset of K17- and Aire-dependent proinflammatory genes.	AIRE is expressed in some skin tumors.

2	Pharmacological activation of AMPK in myofibroblasts from lungs of humans with IPF display lower fibrotic activity, along with enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and normalization of sensitivity to apoptosis.	AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation increases inflammation-related fibrosis in the lungs.
2	In a bleomycin model of lung fibrosis in mice, metformin therapeutically accelerates the resolution of well-established fibrosis in an AMPK-dependent manner.	AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation increases inflammation-related fibrosis in the lungs.
2	These studies implicate deficient AMPK activation in non-resolving, pathologic fibrotic processes, and support a role for metformin (or other AMPK activators) to reverse established fibrosis by facilitating deactivation and apoptosis of myofibroblasts.	AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation increases inflammation-related fibrosis in the lungs.
1	AMPK is a critical sensor of cellular bioenergetics and controls the switch from anabolic to catabolic metabolism5.	AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation increases inflammation-related fibrosis in the lungs.
1	Here, we demonstrate that in humans with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and in an experimental mouse model of lung fibrosis, AMPK activity is lower in fibrotic regions associated with metabolically active and apoptosis-resistant myofibroblasts.	AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation increases inflammation-related fibrosis in the lungs.
1	However, the role of AMPK in fibrosis is not well understood.	AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation increases inflammation-related fibrosis in the lungs.
0	Using human neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells that expressed apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4), a variant of the APOE gene product and the major genetic risk factor for AD, we demonstrated that ApoE4-expressing neurons had higher levels of tau phosphorylation, unrelated to their increased production of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, and that they displayed GABAergic neuron degeneration.	APOE4 expression in iPSC-derived neurons increases AlphaBeta production and tau phosphorylation causing GABA neuron degeneration.
1	Converting ApoE4 to ApoE3 by gene editing rescued these phenotypes, indicating the specific effects of ApoE4.	APOE4 expression in iPSC-derived neurons increases AlphaBeta production and tau phosphorylation causing GABA neuron degeneration.

0	PPM1D mutations were mutually exclusive with TP53 mutations in BSG and attenuated p53 activation in vitro.PPM1D mutations were truncating alterations in exon 6 that enhanced the ability of PPM1D to suppress the activation of the DNA damage response checkpoint protein CHK2.	Activation of PPM1D suppresses p53 function.
1	We also performed targeted mutational analysis of an additional 24 such tumors and genome-wide methylation profiling of 45 gliomas.	Activation of PPM1D suppresses p53 function.
1	These results define PPM1D as a frequent target of somatic mutation and as a potential therapeutic target in brainstem gliomas.	Activation of PPM1D suppresses p53 function.
0	Functional studies demonstrate that the mutations result in enhanced suppression of p53 in response to ionizing radiation exposure, suggesting that the mutant alleles encode hyperactive PPM1D isoforms.	Activation of PPM1D suppresses p53 function.
1	PPM1D PTV mutations were present in 25 out of 7,781 cases versus 1 out of 5,861 controls (P = 1.12 × 10−5), including 18 mutations in 6,912 individuals with breast cancer (P = 2.42 × 10−4) and 12 mutations in 1,121 individuals with ovarian cancer (P = 3.10 × 10−9).	Activation of PPM1D suppresses p53 function.
0	Sequential administration of 5-chloro-2-deoxyuridine and 5-iodo-2-deoxyuridine indicated that all HSCs segregate their chromosomes randomly.	All hematopoietic stem cells segregate their chromosomes randomly.
1	Stem cells are also proposed to retain DNA labels, such as 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU), either because they segregate chromosomes asymmetrically or because they divide slowly.	All hematopoietic stem cells segregate their chromosomes randomly.
0	Although ACE inhibitor therapy usually improves renal blood flow (RBF) and sodium excretion rates in CHF and reduces the rate of progressive renal injury in chronic renal disease, its use can also be associated with a syndrome of “functional renal insufficiency” and/or hyperkalemia.	Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are associated with increased risk for functional renal insufficiency.
0	Understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms and the common risk factors for ACE inhibitor–induced functional ARF is critical, because preventive strategies for ARF exist, and if effectively used, they may permit use of these compounds in a less restricted fashion.	Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are associated with increased risk for functional renal insufficiency.
1	ARF is most likely to occur when renal perfusion pressure cannot be sustained because of substantial decreases in mean arterial pressure (MAP) or when glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is highly angiotensin II (Ang II) dependent.	Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are associated with increased risk for functional renal insufficiency.
1	This form of acute renal failure (ARF) most commonly develops shortly after initiation of ACE inhibitor therapy but can be observed after months or years of therapy, even in the absence of prior ill effects.	Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are associated with increased risk for functional renal insufficiency.

CONCLUSIONS Bacillus anthracis spores used in a recent terrorist incident reaerosolized under common office activities.	Anthrax spores can be disposed of easily after they are dispersed.
1	RESULTS Viable B anthracis spores reaerosolized under semiquiescent conditions, with a marked increase in reaerosolization during simulated active office conditions.	Anthrax spores can be disposed of easily after they are dispersed.
0	Antibiotics can have significant and long-lasting effects on the gastrointestinal tract microbiota, reducing colonization resistance against pathogens including Clostridium difficile.	Antibiotic induced alterations in the gut microbiome reduce resistance against Clostridium difficile
0	Our results indicate that antibiotic-mediated alteration of the gut microbiome converts the global metabolic profile to one that favours C. difficile germination and growth.	Antibiotic induced alterations in the gut microbiome reduce resistance against Clostridium difficile
1	In vitro and ex vivo analyses demonstrate that C. difficile can exploit specific metabolites that become more abundant in the mouse gut after antibiotics, including the primary bile acid taurocholate for germination, and carbon sources such as mannitol, fructose, sorbitol, raffinose and stachyose for growth.	Antibiotic induced alterations in the gut microbiome reduce resistance against Clostridium difficile
1	Levels of secondary bile acids, glucose, free fatty acids and dipeptides decrease, whereas those of primary bile acids and sugar alcohols increase, reflecting the modified metabolic activity of the altered gut microbiome.	Antibiotic induced alterations in the gut microbiome reduce resistance against Clostridium difficile
0	Antiretroviral therapy is strongly associated with a reduction in the incidence of tuberculosis in all baseline CD4 count categories: (1) less than 200 cells/µl (hazard ratio [HR] 0.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.07 to 0.36), (2) 200 to 350 cells/µl (HR 0.34, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.60), (3) greater than 350 cells/µl (HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.63), and (4) any CD4 count (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.44).	Antiretroviral therapy reduces rates of tuberculosis across a broad range of CD4 strata.

0	The expression of various phosphoinositide-binding domains revealed that the podosomes in Src-transformed NIH3T3 (NIH-src) cells are enriched with PtdIns(3,4)P2, suggesting an important role of this phosphoinositide in podosome formation.Live-cell imaging analysis revealed that Src-expression stimulated podosome formation at focal adhesions of NIH3T3 cells after PtdIns(3,4)P2 accumulation.	Assembly of invadopodia is triggered by focal generation of phosphatidylinositol-3,4-biphosphate and the activation of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src.
1	Further, it was found that N-WASP bound all SH3 domains of Tks5/FISH, which facilitated circular podosome formation.	Assembly of invadopodia is triggered by focal generation of phosphatidylinositol-3,4-biphosphate and the activation of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src.
1	Podosomes (also termed invadopodia in cancer cells) are actin-rich adhesion structures with matrix degradation activity that develop in various cell types.

0	UNLABELLED Congruent audiovisual speech enhances our ability to comprehend a speaker, even in noise-free conditions.	Auditory entrainment is strengthened when people see congruent visual and auditory information.
0	When incongruent auditory and visual information is presented concurrently, it can hinder a listener's perception and even cause him or her to perceive information that was not presented in either modality.	Auditory entrainment is strengthened when people see congruent visual and auditory information.
0	We demonstrate that the cortical representation of the speech envelope is enhanced by the presentation of congruent audiovisual speech in noise-free conditions.	Auditory entrainment is strengthened when people see congruent visual and auditory information.
0	Finally, our data suggest that neural entrainment to the speech envelope is inhibited when the auditory and visual streams are incongruent both temporally and contextually.	Auditory entrainment is strengthened when people see congruent visual and auditory information.
0	SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Seeing a speaker's face as he or she talks can greatly help in understanding what the speaker is saying.	Auditory entrainment is strengthened when people see congruent visual and auditory information.
0	Specifically, we show that the brain's representation of auditory speech is enhanced when the accompanying visual speech signal shares the same timing.	Auditory entrainment is strengthened when people see congruent visual and auditory information.
1	Recent electrophysiological studies have demonstrated that cortical response measures to continuous auditory speech can be easily obtained using multivariate analysis methods.	Auditory entrainment is strengthened when people see congruent visual and auditory information.
1	Specifically, we examine how the temporal and contextual congruency of ongoing audiovisual speech affects the cortical encoding of the speech envelope in humans using electroencephalography.	Auditory entrainment is strengthened when people see congruent visual and auditory information.
1	This is because the speaker's facial movements relay information about what the speaker is saying, but also, importantly, when the speaker is saying it.	Auditory entrainment is strengthened when people see congruent visual and auditory information.
1	Efforts to investigate the neural basis of these effects have often focused on the special case of discrete audiovisual syllables that are spatially and temporally congruent, with less work done on the case of natural, continuous speech.	Auditory entrainment is strengthened when people see congruent visual and auditory information.
1	Here we introduce a new approach for doing this using relatively inexpensive and noninvasive scalp recordings.	Auditory entrainment is strengthened when people see congruent visual and auditory information.
1	Furthermore, we show that this enhancement is most pronounced at a time scale that corresponds to mean syllable length.	Auditory entrainment is strengthened when people see congruent visual and auditory information.
2	Also, during the 1-year follow-up, combined analysis of MSC-treated groups revealed significantly decreased risk of opportunistic infections than the control group (hazard ratio, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.20-0.85, P=.02)   CONCLUSION Among patients undergoing renal transplant, the use of autologous MSCs compared with anti-IL-2 receptor antibody induction therapy resulted in lower incidence of acute rejection, decreased risk of opportunistic infection, and better estimated renal function at 1 year.	Autologous transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells causes a higher rate of opportunistic infections than induction therapy with anti-interleukin-2 receptor antibodies.

1	DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS One hundred fifty-nine patients were enrolled in this single-site, prospective, open-label, randomized study from February 2008-May 2009, when recruitment was completed.	Autologous transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells causes fewer opportunistic infections than induction therapy with anti-interleukin-2 receptor antibodies.
0	After 6 months, 4 of 53 patients (7.5%) in the autologous MSC plus standard-dose CNI group (95% CI, 0.4%-14.7%; P = .04) and 4 of 52 patients (7.7%) in the low-dose group (95% CI, 0.5%-14.9%; P = .046) compared with 11 of 51 controls (21.6%; 95% CI, 10.5%-32.6%) had biopsy-confirmed acute rejection.

0	We have previously found that CMA activity declines in aged organisms and have proposed that this failure in cellular clearance could contribute to the accumulation of altered proteins, the abnormal cellular homeostasis and, eventually, the functional loss characteristic of aged organisms.	Autophagy declines in aged organisms.

0	Bariatric surgery was, however, consistently associated with postoperative decreases in the prevalence of depression (7 studies; 8%-74% decrease) and the severity of depressive symptoms (6 studies; 40%-70% decrease).	Bariatric surgery has a positive impact on mental health.
0	Moderate-quality evidence supports an association between bariatric surgery and lower rates of depression postoperatively.	Bariatric surgery has a positive impact on mental health.
1	IMPORTANCE Bariatric surgery is associated with sustained weight loss and improved physical health status for severely obese individuals.	Bariatric surgery has a positive impact on mental health.
1	Mental health conditions may be common among patients seeking bariatric surgery; however, the prevalence of these conditions and whether they are associated with postoperative outcomes remains unknown.	Bariatric surgery has a positive impact on mental health.
2	We report that activation of basophils by autoreactive IgE causes their homing to lymph nodes, promoting T helper type 2 (T(H)2) cell differentiation and enhancing the production of self-reactive antibodies that cause lupus-like nephritis in mice lacking the Src family protein tyrosine kinase Lyn (Lyn(-/-) mice).	Basophils counteract disease development in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
2	Individuals with SLE also have elevated serum IgE, self-reactive IgEs and activated basophils that express CD62 ligand (CD62L) and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecule human leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR), parameters that are associated with increased disease activity and active lupus nephritis.	Basophils counteract disease development in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
2	Thus, in Lyn(-/-) mice, basophils and IgE autoantibodies amplify autoantibody production that leads to lupus nephritis, and in individuals with SLE IgE autoantibodies and activated basophils are factors associated with disease activity and nephritis.	Basophils counteract disease development in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
0	Birth weight was positively associated with breast cancer risk in studies based on birth records (pooled relative risk [RR] per one standard deviation [SD] [= 0.5 kg] increment in birth weight: 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.09) and parental recall when the participants were children (1.02; 95% CI 0.99-1.05), but not in those based on adult self-reports, or maternal recall during the woman's adulthood (0.98; 95% CI 0.95-1.01) (p for heterogeneity between data sources = 0.003).	Birth-weight is positively associated with breast cancer.
0	Relative to women who weighed 3.000-3.499 kg, the risk was 0.96 (CI 0.80-1.16) in those who weighed < 2.500 kg, and 1.12 (95% CI 1.00-1.25) in those who weighed > or = 4.000 kg (p for linear trend = 0.001) in birth record data.	Birth-weight is positively associated with breast cancer.
0	CONCLUSIONS This pooled analysis of individual participant data is consistent with birth size, and in particular birth length, being an independent correlate of breast cancer risk in adulthood.	Birth-weight is positively associated with breast cancer.
1	Individual participant data from 32 studies, comprising 22,058 breast cancer cases, were obtained.	Birth-weight is positively associated with breast cancer.
1	The birth size effects did not appear to be confounded or mediated by established breast cancer risk factors and were not modified by age or menopausal status.	Birth-weight is positively associated with breast cancer.
1	Simultaneous adjustment for these three birth size variables showed that length was the strongest independent predictor of risk.	Birth-weight is positively associated with breast cancer.
0	The majority of studies identified a positive link between birthweight and premenopausal, but not postmenopausal, breast cancer.	Birth-weight is positively associated with breast cancer.
0	The relative risk estimate for breast cancer comparing women with high birthweight to women with low birthweight combining all studies including both pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer was 1.23 (95% confidence interval 1.13-1.34).	Birth-weight is positively associated with breast cancer.
1	The mechanisms underlying this association likely include elevated levels of growth factors that may increase the number of susceptible stem cells in the mammary gland or initiate tumors through DNA mutations.	Birth-weight is positively associated with breast cancer.
1	Breast cancer may originate in utero.	Birth-weight is positively associated with breast cancer.
0	Increased risk of breast cancer was noted with increased birthweight (relative risk [RR] 1.15 [95% CI 1.09-1.21]), birth length (1.28 [1.11-1.48]), higher maternal age (1.13 [1.02-1.25]), and paternal age (1.12 [1.05-1.19]).	Birth-weight is positively associated with breast cancer.
1	We reviewed separately each of the perinatal factors, including birthweight, birth length, parental age at delivery, gestational age, intrauterine exposure to diethylstilbestrol, twin membership, maternal pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, and other factors.	Birth-weight is positively associated with breast cancer.
0	RESULTS We found that heavier birth weights were associated with increased breast cancer risk, with studies involving five categories of birth weight identifying odds ratios (ORs) of 1.24 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04 to 1.48) for 4,000 g or more and 1.15 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.26) for 3,500 g to 3,999 g, relative to a birth weight of 2,500 to 2,599 g.

1	Total cholesterol levels and systolic blood pressure were higher and levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were lower among participants with low vs high fitness.	High cardiopulmonary fitness causes increased mortality rate.
2	In the first year of follow-up, multivariable-adjusted odds ratios for having frequent exacerbations were 1.2 (95% CI, 0.7-2.2; 17 events/1000 person-years) for individuals with 1 high biomarker, 1.7 (95% CI, 0.9-3.2; 32 events/1000 person-years) for individuals with 2 high biomarkers, and 3.7 (95% CI, 1.9-7.4; 81 events/1000 person-years) for individuals with 3 high biomarkers compared with individuals who had no elevated biomarkers (9 events/1000 person-years; trend: P = 2 × 10(-5)).	High levels of CRP reduces the risk of exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
2	CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Simultaneously elevated levels of CRP and fibrinogen and leukocyte count in individuals with COPD were associated with increased risk of having exacerbations, even in those with milder COPD and in those without previous exacerbations.	High levels of CRP reduces the risk of exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
1	Of these, 6574 had COPD, defined as a ratio between forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity below 0.7.	High levels of CRP reduces the risk of exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
1	OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that elevated levels of inflammatory biomarkers in individuals with stable COPD are associated with an increased risk of having exacerbations.	High levels of CRP reduces the risk of exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
0	However, this method should be part of a comprehensive triage strategy and may not be appropriate for patients who present less than three hours after symptom onset.	High-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (HSCT-T) dosage may not be diagnostic if the onset of symptoms occurs less than 3 hours before acute myocardial injury (AMI).
1	The results for 14 ng/L and 3-5 ng/L cut-off values were pooled separately.	High-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (HSCT-T) dosage may not be diagnostic if the onset of symptoms occurs less than 3 hours before acute myocardial injury (AMI).
0	This strategy, based at least in part on an HMT-dependent inhibitory histone code, imposes a requirement for specific histone demethylases, including LSD1, to permit ligand- and signal-dependent activation of regulated gene expression.	Histone demethylase recruitment and a transient decrease in histone methylation is necessary for ligand-dependent induction of transcription by nuclear receptors.
1	These events link an inhibitory methylation component of the histone code to a broadly used strategy that circumvents pathological constitutive gene induction by physiologically regulated transcription factors.	Histone demethylase recruitment and a transient decrease in histone methylation is necessary for ligand-dependent induction of transcription by nuclear receptors.

0	Here we show that activation of ORX-synthesizing neurons is necessary for developing a panic-prone state in the rat panic model, and either silencing of the hypothalamic gene encoding ORX (Hcrt) with RNAi or systemic ORX-1 receptor antagonists blocks the panic responses.	Hypocretin neurones induce panicprone state in rats.
1	Taken together, our results suggest that the ORX system may be involved in the pathophysiology of panic anxiety and that ORX antagonists constitute a potential new treatment strategy for panic disorder.	Hypocretin neurones induce panicprone state in rats.
0	Compared with patients with no hypoglycemia, patients with single or multiple episodes had a graded increase in risk with fully adjusted hazard ratios (HRs): for 1 episode (HR, 1.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-1.49); 2 episodes (HR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.37-2.36); and 3 or more episodes (HR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.42-2.64).

0	Whereas adult tissues contain a predominance of memory T cells, in pediatric blood and tissues the main subset consists of naive recent thymic emigrants, with effector memory T cells (T(EM)) found only in the lungs and small intestine.	In adult tissue, most T cells are memory T cells.
1	Pediatric tissue T(reg) cells suppress endogenous T cell activation, and early T cell functionality is confined to the mucosal sites that have the lowest T(reg):T(EM) cell ratios, which suggests control in situ of immune responses in early life.	In adult tissue, most T cells are memory T cells.
2	Cells expressing high amounts of CSF1R (CSF1Rhigh cells), but not those expressing low amounts of CSF1R (CSF1Rlow cells), showed potent leukemia-initiating activity.	In mouse models, the loss of CSF1R facilitates MOZ-TIF2-induced leuekmogenesis.
2	Moreover, induction of AML was suppressed in CSF1R-deficient mice and CSF1R inhibitors slowed the progression of MOZ-TIF2–induced leukemia.	In mouse models, the loss of CSF1R facilitates MOZ-TIF2-induced leuekmogenesis.
2	Thus, in this subtype of AML, leukemia stem cells are contained within the CSF1Rhigh cell population, and we suggest that targeting of PU.1-mediated upregulation of CSF1R expression might be a useful therapeutic approach.	In mouse models, the loss of CSF1R facilitates MOZ-TIF2-induced leuekmogenesis.

0	RESULTS The incidence of heart failure was higher among men (378/100 000 persons; 95% confidence interval [CI], 361-395 for men; 289/100 000 persons; 95% CI, 277-300 for women) and did not change over time among men or women.	Incidence of heart failure decreased by 10% in women since 1979.
1	CONCLUSION In this community-based cohort, the incidence of heart failure has not declined during 2 decades, but survival after onset of heart failure has increased overall, with less improvement among women and elderly persons.	Incidence of heart failure decreased by 10% in women since 1979.
0	The number of women dying from cervical cancer in 1997 was 7% lower than in 1996 and has fallen by over 25% since 1992.1 Such rapid change must be at least partly due to cervical screening, although strong cohort effects have caused large fluctuations in cervical mortality in the past.2 We modelled mortality data, taking into account the effects of age and year of birth and looking for trends in time within four age groups to estimate the beneficial effects of cervical screening.	Incidence rates of cervical cancer have decreased.
1	Mortality since 1993 was adjusted upwards by 4% because of changes in classification of cause of death.3  We modelled the data assuming that the age specific mortality is the product of a smoothly varying age effect, birth cohort effect, and age dependent …	Incidence rates of cervical cancer have decreased.
0	RESULTS The mean incidence of cervical carcinoma in the early 1960s was 15.4 per 10(5) woman-years.In 1991, it was only 2.7 per 10(5) woman-years.	Incidence rates of cervical cancer have decreased.
1	The mortality rate has decreased in the same proportion since the mass screening program.	Incidence rates of cervical cancer have decreased.
1	Thus, it might be possible to decrease the incidence of cervical adenocarcinoma.	Incidence rates of cervical cancer have decreased.

1	In 2003, age-adjusted incidence and mortality in Finland were 4.0 and 0.9 and in the Netherlands 4.9 and 1.4 per 100,000 woman-years, respectively.	Incidence rates of cervical cancer have decreased.
2	Incidence and mortality rates have declined more in Finland.	Incidence rates of cervical cancer have increased due to nationwide screening programs based primarily on cytology to detect uterine cervical cancer.
2	The decline in mortality in Finland seems to be almost completely related to the screening programme whereas in the Netherlands it was initially considered to be a natural decline.	Incidence rates of cervical cancer have increased due to nationwide screening programs based primarily on cytology to detect uterine cervical cancer.
1	Screening protocols for smear taking and referral to the gynaecologist are comparable.	Incidence rates of cervical cancer have increased due to nationwide screening programs based primarily on cytology to detect uterine cervical cancer.

2	We tested whether the delivery and efficacy of gemcitabine in the mice could be improved by coadministration of IPI-926, a drug that depletes tumor-associated stromal tissue by inhibition of the Hedgehog cellular signaling pathway.The combination therapy produced a transient increase in intratumoral vascular density and intratumoral concentration of gemcitabine, leading to transient stabilization of disease.	Increased vessel density along with a reduction in fibrosis decreases the efficacy of chemotherapy treatments.
1	Studying a mouse model of PDA that is refractory to the clinically used drug gemcitabine, we found that the tumors in this model were poorly perfused and poorly vascularized, properties that are shared with human PDA.	Increased vessel density along with a reduction in fibrosis decreases the efficacy of chemotherapy treatments.
1	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is among the most lethal human cancers in part because it is insensitive to many chemotherapeutic drugs.	Increased vessel density along with a reduction in fibrosis decreases the efficacy of chemotherapy treatments.

Lupus-prone mice infected with curliproducing bacteria have higher autoantibody titers compared to controls.
0	Here, we show that an inhibitory MHC I receptor, Ly49Q, was crucial for the swift polarization of and tissue infiltration by neutrophils.	Ly49Q directs the organization of neutrophil migration to inflammation sites by regulating membrane raft functions.
0	Ly49Q-dependent polarization and migration were affected by Ly49Q regulation of membrane raft functions.	Ly49Q directs the organization of neutrophil migration to inflammation sites by regulating membrane raft functions.
1	We propose that Ly49Q is pivotal in switching neutrophils to their polarized morphology and rapid migration upon inflammation, through its spatiotemporal regulation of membrane rafts and raft-associated signaling molecules.	Ly49Q directs the organization of neutrophil migration to inflammation sites by regulating membrane raft functions.
1	These opposite functions appeared to be mediated by distinct use of effector phosphatase SHP-1 and SHP-2.	Ly49Q directs the organization of neutrophil migration to inflammation sites by regulating membrane raft functions.
2	Under inflammatory conditions elicited either by acute infection with Listeria monocytogenes or chronic infection with Leishmania major, there was a significant increase in immature Ly-6C(high) monocytes, resembling the inflammatory left shift of granulocytes.	Ly6C hi monocytes have a lower inflammatory capacity than Ly6C lo monocytes.
2	In addition, acute peritoneal inflammation recruited preferentially Ly-6C(med-high) monocytes.	Ly6C hi monocytes have a lower inflammatory capacity than Ly6C lo monocytes.

0	Lysine acetylation is a reversible posttranslational modifcation, an epigenetic phenomenon, referred to as transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl CoA to lysine e- amino group of targeted protein, which is modulated by acetyltransferases (histone/ lysine (K) acetyltransferases, HATs/KATs) and deacetylases (histone/lysine (K) deacetylases, HDACs/KDACs).	Many proteins in human cells can be post-translationally modified at lysine residues via acetylation.

2	An efficacious antimalarial regimen with no specific gametocytocidal properties but a long prophylactic time was estimated to be more effective at reducing transmission than a short-acting ACT in the highest-transmission setting.	Mathematical models predict that using Artemisinin-based combination therapy over nongametocytocidal drugs have a dramatic impact in reducing malaria transmission.
1	The absolute size of the public health impact, however, was greater in the highest-transmission area, with 54 clinical episodes per 100 persons per year averted compared to five per 100 persons per year in the lowest-transmission area.	Mathematical models predict that using Artemisinin-based combination therapy over nongametocytocidal drugs have a dramatic impact in reducing malaria transmission.
0	On balance, a combination including oxaliplatin was preferable to single-agent fluoropyrimidines, although the primary endpoint of PFS was not met.

2	METHODS AND RESULTS We showed that IFN-gamma receptor-deficient mice (IFN-gammaR(-/-)) on a BALB/c background immunized with a peptide derived from cardiac alpha-myosin heavy chain develop severe myocarditis with high mortality.	Mice that lack Interferon-γ or its receptor exhibit high resistance to experimental autoimmune myocarditis.
2	Although myocarditis subsided in wild-type mice after 3 weeks, IFN-gammaR(-/-) mice showed persistent disease.	Mice that lack Interferon-γ or its receptor exhibit high resistance to experimental autoimmune myocarditis.

2	In order to test directly that an approximately twofold reduction in IL-2 underpins the Idd3-linked destabilization of immune homeostasis, we show that engineered haplodeficiency of Il2 gene expression not only reduces T cell IL-2 production by twofold but also mimics the autoimmune dysregulatory effects of the naturally occurring susceptibility alleles of Il2.Reduced IL-2 production achieved by either genetic mechanism correlates with reduced function of CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T cells, which are critical for maintaining immune homeostasis.

2	The 20% SSB tax was anticipated to reduce overweight and obesity prevalence by 3.0% (95% CI 1.6%-5.9%) and type 2 diabetes incidence by 1.6% (95% CI 1.2%-1.9%) among various Indian subpopulations over the period 2014-2023, if SSB consumption continued to increase linearly in accordance with secular trends.	Taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages had no effect on the incidence rate of type II diabetes in India.
2	However, acceleration in SSB consumption trends consistent with industry marketing models would be expected to increase the impact efficacy of taxation, averting 4.2% of prevalent overweight/obesity (95% CI 2.5-10.0%) and 2.5% (95% CI 1.0-2.8%) of incident type 2 diabetes from 2014-2023.	Taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages had no effect on the incidence rate of type II diabetes in India.
2	CONCLUSION Sustained SSB taxation at a high tax rate could mitigate rising obesity and type 2 diabetes in India among both urban and rural subpopulations.	Taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages had no effect on the incidence rate of type II diabetes in India.

0	RESULTS Use of statins in either the prior 180 days (adjusted OR, 0.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.33-0.76) or prior 3 years (adjusted OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.40-0.82) was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of hip fracture, even after controlling for variables such as race, insurance status, psychoactive medications, estrogen and thiazide use, ischemic heart disease, cancer, and diabetes mellitus.	There is an inverse relationship between hip fractures and statin use.
0	Clear relationships were observed between the degree of reduction in hip fracture risk and the extent of statin use; there was no evidence of such relationships with nonstatin lipid-lowering agents.	There is an inverse relationship between hip fractures and statin use.
0	After adjusting for extent of statin use in the prior 3 years, current use (on the index date) was associated with a 71% reduction in risk (adjusted OR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.10-0.81).	There is an inverse relationship between hip fractures and statin use.
0	CONCLUSIONS These findings support an association between statin use by elderly patients and reduction in the risk of hip fracture.	There is an inverse relationship between hip fractures and statin use.
1	OBJECTIVE To determine whether the use of statins is associated with reduced hip fracture risk.	There is an inverse relationship between hip fractures and statin use.
1	CONTEXT Recent animal studies have found that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) lipid-lowering drugs (statins) substantially increase bone formation, but whether statin use in humans results in clinically meaningful bone formation or a reduction in the risk of osteoporotic fractures is not known.	There is an inverse relationship between hip fractures and statin use.
1	MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Adjusted odds ratio (OR) of hip fracture by statin use in the 180 days and 3 years prior to the index date (the earliest date of admission for surgery), adjusted for demographic and clinical characteristics and health care utilization.	There is an inverse relationship between hip fractures and statin use.

0	The primary outcome occurred in 126 (10.0%) patients allocated to thigh-length GCS and in 133 (10.5%) allocated to avoid GCS, resulting in a non-significant absolute reduction in risk of 0.5% (95% CI -1.9% to 2.9%).	Thigh-length graduated compression stockings (GCS) did not reduce deep vein thrombosis in patients admitted to hospital who are immobile because of acute stroke.
0	INTERPRETATION These data do not lend support to the use of thigh-length GCS in patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke.	Thigh-length graduated compression stockings (GCS) did not reduce deep vein thrombosis in patients admitted to hospital who are immobile because of acute stroke.

2	We developed a small-molecule fast-skeletal-troponin activator, CK-2017357, as a means to increase muscle strength by amplifying the response of muscle when neural input is otherwise diminished secondary to neuromuscular disease.	Tirasemtiv has no effect on fast-twitch muscle.
2	Binding selectively to the fast-skeletal-troponin complex, CK-2017357 slows the rate of calcium release from troponin C and sensitizes muscle to calcium.	Tirasemtiv has no effect on fast-twitch muscle.
1	Notably, we show that sensitization of the fast-skeletal-troponin complex to calcium improves muscle force and grip strength immediately after administration of single doses of CK-2017357 in a model of the neuromuscular disease myasthenia gravis.	Tirasemtiv has no effect on fast-twitch muscle.

1	These findings indicate that human glia differentially enhance both activity-dependent plasticity and learning in mice.	Transplanted human glial cells can differentiate within the host animal.
2	Long-term potentiation (LTP) was sharply enhanced in the human glial chimeric mice, as was their learning, as assessed by Barnes maze navigation, object-location memory, and both contextual and tone fear conditioning.	Transplanted human glial progenitor cells are incapable of forming a neural network with host animals' neurons.

0	Here we show that damage-induced fork reversal in mammalian cells requires PCNA ubiquitination, UBC13, and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, previously involved in error-free damage tolerance.	Ubiquitin ligase UBC13 generates a K63-linked polyubiquitin moiety at PCNA K164.
1	Mutations affecting fork reversal also induced unrestrained fork progression and chromosomal breakage, suggesting fork remodeling as a global fork slowing and protection mechanism.	Ubiquitin ligase UBC13 generates a K63-linked polyubiquitin moiety at PCNA K164.

0	Birth weight was positively associated with breast cancer risk in studies based on birth records (pooled relative risk [RR] per one standard deviation [SD] [= 0.5 kg] increment in birth weight: 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.09) and parental recall when the participants were children (1.02; 95% CI 0.99-1.05), but not in those based on adult self-reports, or maternal recall during the woman's adulthood (0.98; 95% CI 0.95-1.01) (p for heterogeneity between data sources = 0.003).	Women with a higher birth weight are more likely to develop breast cancer later in life.
0	Relative to women who weighed 3.000-3.499 kg, the risk was 0.96 (CI 0.80-1.16) in those who weighed < 2.500 kg, and 1.12 (95% CI 1.00-1.25) in those who weighed > or = 4.000 kg (p for linear trend = 0.001) in birth record data.	Women with a higher birth weight are more likely to develop breast cancer later in life.
1	CONCLUSIONS This pooled analysis of individual participant data is consistent with birth size, and in particular birth length, being an independent correlate of breast cancer risk in adulthood.	Women with a higher birth weight are more likely to develop breast cancer later in life.
1	The birth size effects did not appear to be confounded or mediated by established breast cancer risk factors and were not modified by age or menopausal status.	Women with a higher birth weight are more likely to develop breast cancer later in life.
0	The majority of studies identified a positive link between birthweight and premenopausal, but not postmenopausal, breast cancer.	Women with a higher birth weight are more likely to develop breast cancer later in life.
0	The relative risk estimate for breast cancer comparing women with high birthweight to women with low birthweight combining all studies including both pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer was 1.23 (95% confidence interval 1.13-1.34).	Women with a higher birth weight are more likely to develop breast cancer later in life.
1	Loss of imprinting (LOI) of growth hormone genes relevant for intrauterine growth, such as insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), leads to abnormally high levels of these hormones evidenced by high birthweight.	Women with a higher birth weight are more likely to develop breast cancer later in life.
1	The mechanisms underlying this association likely include elevated levels of growth factors that may increase the number of susceptible stem cells in the mammary gland or initiate tumors through DNA mutations.	Women with a higher birth weight are more likely to develop breast cancer later in life.
0	Increased risk of breast cancer was noted with increased birthweight (relative risk [RR] 1.15 [95% CI 1.09-1.21]), birth length (1.28 [1.11-1.48]), higher maternal age (1.13 [1.02-1.25]), and paternal age (1.12 [1.05-1.19]).	Women with a higher birth weight are more likely to develop breast cancer later in life.
1	No association was noted between risk of breast cancer and gestational age at birth (0.95 [0.71-1.26]) or maternal diethylstilbestrol treatment (1.40 [0.86-2.28]).	Women with a higher birth weight are more likely to develop breast cancer later in life.
0	RESULTS We found that heavier birth weights were associated with increased breast cancer risk, with studies involving five categories of birth weight identifying odds ratios (ORs) of 1.24 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04 to 1.48) for 4,000 g or more and 1.15 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.26) for 3,500 g to 3,999 g, relative to a birth weight of 2,500 to 2,599 g. These studies provided no support for a J-shaped relationship of birthweight to risk.	Women with a higher birth weight are more likely to develop breast cancer later in life.
1	METHODS We reviewed breast cancer studies published from January 1966 to February 2007 that included data on birth weight, birth order, maternal age, gestational age, twin status, and maternal or paternal smoking.	Women with a higher birth weight are more likely to develop breast cancer later in life.
