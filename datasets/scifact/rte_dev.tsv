3	We propose as an alternative explanation that variants much less common than the associated one may create "synthetic associations" by occurring, stochastically, more often in association with one of the alleles at the common site versus the other allele.We show that they are not only possible, but inevitable, and that under simple but reasonable genetic models, they are likely to account for or contribute to many of the recently identified signals reported in genome-wide association studies.	1,000 genomes project enables mapping of genetic sequence variation consisting of rare variants with larger penetrance effects than common variants.	entailment

179	Increased risk of breast cancer was noted with increased birthweight (relative risk [RR] 1.15 [95% CI 1.09-1.21]), birth length (1.28 [1.11-1.48]), higher maternal age (1.13 [1.02-1.25]), and paternal age (1.12 [1.05-1.19]).	Birth-weight is positively associated with breast cancer.	entailment

1385	This conclusion was supported by experiments that showed that enhancing cSMAC formation reduced stimulatory capacity of the weak peptide.	cSMAC formation enhances weak ligand signalling.	entailment
1385	An in silico approach suggested that the inability to form the central supramolecular activation cluster (cSMAC) could underlie the increased proliferation.	cSMAC formation enhances weak ligand signalling.	neutral
1389	mTORC2 phosphorylates serine 26 at the cytosolic N terminus of xCT, inhibiting its activity.Genetic inhibition of mTORC2, or pharmacologic inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase, promotes glutamate secretion, cystine uptake, and incorporation into glutathione, linking growth factor receptor signaling with amino acid uptake and utilization.	mTORC2 regulates intracellular cysteine levels through xCT inhibition.	entailment
1389	Using an unbiased proteomic screen, we identified mTORC2 as a critical regulator of amino acid metabolism in cancer via phosphorylation of the cystine-glutamate antiporter xCT.	mTORC2 regulates intracellular cysteine levels through xCT inhibition.	neutral
1389	Mutations in cancer reprogram amino acid metabolism to drive tumor growth, but the molecular mechanisms are not well understood.	mTORC2 regulates intracellular cysteine levels through xCT inhibition.	neutral
